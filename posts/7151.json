It&#39;s highly dependent on your situation and the work you do during your internship. If your work involves an &#34;intern&#34; project or something that is not core to a product or the company it is probably very doable. I was working on stuff that\u00a0ended up being core to one of the company&#39;s major products, so when bugs arose I needed to address them ASAP. This could put undo stress on me at the most inopportune times (midterm season). It really prevented me from putting in enough time to my classes / extracurriculars / social life that was more important to me. Like I said, highly dependent on the company you work for though. As long as you aren&#39;t working on mission critical things under a deadline it is probably very doable. I would also recommend working under a fixed schedule rather than a flexible one, as a flexible one inevitably results in the company asking you to do more work than you feel you can at certain times.</span></div>", "created": "2018-06-12T13:27:28Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<span style=\"background-color:#fff\">I\u2019ve been interning (part time, 20hr/wk) during the school year for the last three years, and most likely will again this year.
