I would say if you found it easy to get A&#39;s in 61A/B and 53 and 54, you should be able to handle the schedule pretty well. Having 134 and 70 in the same semester was extremely helpful for me to learn the probability and the second part of cs70 should be easier because you would have done a lot of it in 134 already. Plus, there are a lot more people taking 134 this semester so the curve should be more lenient (I think?). Definitely try not to fall behind in 61c, because the class moves pretty fast and has a high workload.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2017-01-20T07:40:24Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-18T23:07:41Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hiiiiii, so I&#39;m getting a little nervous about my schedule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How manageable would CS70, CS61C, Stat 134, and hopefully an easy breadth (I&#39;m in an english class that seems like a lot of work but hopefully I&#39;ll get into Theater 10 which is basically no work outside of class) be?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m getting a little intimidated by Stat 134 since the last time I&#39;ve done probability was freshman year of high school (I&#39;m a sophomore now).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For reference:</p>\n<p>I thought 61A and 61B were both pretty asy to get As in if that means anything.
