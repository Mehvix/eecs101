Its gotten to the point where everybody is just submitting multiple papers to these conferences and they&#39;ve been flooded with submissions, so it&#39;s been hard to get good quality control.\n\n2) I&#39;d recommend you to pick a specific subfield of machine learning that might be interesting to you, and digging as deep as you can. There are benefits to reading papers from a broad spectrum of areas within the field, but at an early stage of your research career I think it is more important to hone in on one and learn what you can rather than trying to see anything. In this case, look at what some of the professors are doing here in which you might be interested in, read through their papers and also the various papers that they cite and dig around.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-01-04T19:44:59Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/5 - 1/11", "bucket_order": 12, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/5 - 1/11", "bucket_order": 12, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-05T23:07:05Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k51mlqvkpob4q3", "subject": "<p>Thanks!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2020-01-05T23:07:05Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/5 - 1/11", "bucket_order": 12, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-06T02:32:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k51ty722sw163t", "subject": "<p>No problem!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jydlyk1lid57di", "updated": "2020-01-06T02:32:44Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-05T16:18:02Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k517zpd8zcxt9", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Two Minute Papers is a YouTube channel that frequently features interesting ML papers - you can scroll through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their videos</a> to see if you find anything interesting</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "jydlyk1lid57di", "updated": "2020-01-05T16:18:02Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/5 - 1/11", "bucket_order": 12, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/12 - 1/18", "bucket_order": 11, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-14T04:33:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k5ddruazjhs10t", "subject": "Thanks!", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2020-01-14T04:33:07Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-09T17:29:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k570b5y5z2h6jm", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<a href=\"http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/\">http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/</a>\u00a0is a good way of finding papers that are recent and popular.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6pa03jyhf193", "updated": "2020-01-09T17:29:37Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10104": 5, "10150": 8, "10528": 0, "2586": 7, "4982": 2, "5229": 1, "6316": 6, "7230": 4, "7977": 3, "9818": 9}}, "created": "2020-01-04T09:05:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am interested learning the newest updates in ML through reading some recent papers.
