Someone else might answer your question better, but here is what I found on the Berkeley Reddit page from a former 61BL TA.

The instructors are veteran TAs who have taught the class for years, and we are 100% dedicated to making this summer the best learning experience as we possibly can. Historically people have really enjoyed 61BL because of the lab based format. Essentially you will be doing a lot of learning by doing, which will entail implementing data structures, algorithms, etc nearly every day in lab after you have learned about them. We like to think that you will come out of 61BL an even stronger programmer than if you had taken 61B because you will be writing much more code (25-30 labs &#43; 4 projects). There is also the benefit of taking a single class over the summer where you will be able to focus much more of your energy on learning and doing well in the class. We would absolutely love to have as many students take 61BL this summer because think this is going to be the best offering of 61BL ever, but we can understand if you would want to wait to take the class with Hug.&#34;</p>", "created": "2020-05-04T07:08:14Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "k9s56vcvhr91ze", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdjl24y7f5nf", "name": "Amritansh Saraf", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzqdjl24y7f5nf"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-04T11:31:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9sel2fyvnv33n", "subject": "<p>Again, I am taking 61BL with you, so I really have no idea how it&#39;s going to go compared to a regular semester...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can check on previous semesters or 61B and 61BL websites for the grading policies and compare if you&#39;re curious.
