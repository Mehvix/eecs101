I came with no knowledge of CS and very poor math background to Berkeley as ChemE and then changed into L&amp;S to pursue CS after my first semester. I feel that the cap is more doable if you know you want to do CS from the get go, especially if you have previous experience. It is a bit unfair because if you had no experience and get a B in 61a it&#39;s going to be an upslope battle where you will have to get a B&#43; and A- in 61b and 70, which is honestly crazy for someone with no prior experience. I think it is a bit delicate because there is simply too much people who want to do CS and it is hard to find a way of restricting the major to the ones that really want it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, you might be incredibly talented but might only want to do the major to land a job offer and get $$$ and might not really like the field. On the other end you might be incredibly passionate about the field but not have awesome grades. The first student might end up with three A- and the second one might miss the cut-off by falling short by\u00a0half a letter step in CS70. This for me is very disheartening, especially if the second person really tried hard from 61a into 61b and then was full-stoped at 70. Ofc, the first person should not be stopped from declaring because he is capable and we cannot interrogate everyone with a magnifying glass and simply kick out everyone who does not breathe CS. But at the same time it is sad for me to see the second person to miss out of the major. This is not something I feel happens in purpose nor something caused specifically by Berkeley EECS, but it is still a situation that might occur. People will say &#34;just appeal&#34; but in my head that is just not right. You are barring a deeply interested individual from granted admission into their passion while you let in people that scored slightly better than him but that might not be so in love with the subject. And the person might not get in in the end (and if he ends up under 3.2 the appeal is no longer a solution)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2018-05-23T11:15:40Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/20 - 5/26", "bucket_order": 97, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-24T18:54:36Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhkwclmwjro4xy", "subject": "<p>not to mention the gpa cutoff is classist, because anyone who&#39;s had the resources to take Computer Science classes in high school can come in and do way better than harder working more motivated kids simply by virtue of having more exposure. the fact that the University continues to propagate these class differences after admitting students is enraging.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_8", "updated": "2018-05-24T18:54:36Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/20 - 5/26", "bucket_order": 97, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-24T19:03:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhkwnngga2l3o", "subject": "<p>Honestly I feel like the above comment is a bit overstated.

The GPA cutoff is brutal and yes it does suck to have to have it, but that&#39;s a byproduct of the demand for the CS major being so high that the department can only realistically support so many students with the money the university provides.

With that said, declaring was an extreme struggle for me and I barely made it.
