I think the best way to do it is start with older exams building up to more recent ones, since they&#39;ll most likely be most similar to what you will see. Try to take an entire exam timed and in one sitting, this will give you a good idea of what the exam will really be like (time-wise). Take it in a quiet place, prepare a cheat sheet ahead of time as if you were really taking it. Afterwards, score yourself and go over the questions. Once you see a question is wrong, try to reason about it before looking at the explanation from the solution. Also try to identify which questions you&#39;re struggling the most with. Most questions can be sort of categorized, some test understanding and ability to recollect theorems (more mechanical questions for example). Others test analytical abilities,\u00a0like questions that call upon a theorem, but maybe ask about an application or a modified version, or maybe a different setting of the theorem. Then you have &#34;creation&#34; questions that require you to put together what you&#39;ve learned and develop a new theorem or proof such as proof writing questions. See where you&#39;re struggling most so you can pick out similar problems and focus on them specifically. Also know that in general these get harder respectively, but it&#39;s good to build up to difficult questions - don&#39;t just jump into the most difficult problems on an exam. Also know that the True False or multiple choice questions can be just as challenging as any proof question, some multiple choice/TF questions might actually require you to think about a proof to answer them, so don&#39;t be discouraged if that portion is hard. I&#39;d also recommend studying at Office Hours when you can, so while you might not have questions throughout, you&#39;ll be able to get questions answered immediately when you do have a question.</p>\n<p>Also as a heads up, when I took the class I think the final composed of about 2/3 probability theory 1/3 discrete math (double check on that on the 70 piazza though).\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-04-23T06:08:45Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i10w5yv8nUg"}], "id": "jgbucawpie43qc", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7c2ca2q62f", "name": "Jacob Martinez", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipf2ezhjrt956a", "name": "Urvi Guglani", "photo": "1520734378_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ipf2ezhjrt956a/1520734378_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1553809534, "j5zp8esecm31rr": 1513138336, "jkjku77a1h451b": 1536436466, "jps21q5aago51y": 1553809456, "jza9erz2ojy3qr": 1576486118, "k509eg2kx302ol": 1583277374}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3zjqzc63t8", "name": "Rachel De Jaen", "photo": "1549844268_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6nu3zjqzc63t8/1549844268_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1525153666, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1527030308, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1525109355, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1539234857}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9v8jj8x141", "name": "Mohammed Shaikh", "photo": "1515230849_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9v8jj8x141/1515230849_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkfr8wxmo61w9", "name": "Ana Nelson", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0q7ryrxxp43", "name": "Sreyas N", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p7c2ca2q62f", "ipf2ezhjrt956a", "j6nu3zjqzc63t8", "is6p9v8jj8x141", "ipkfr8wxmo61w9", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "iy0q7ryrxxp43"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-23T04:49:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "cs-intended", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m in CS 70 this semester and I&#39;ve been doing about &#43;0.2-0.4 SD on the midterms.
