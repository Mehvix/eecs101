I think 168 is the one of the lowest workload upper divs and if you take it after 161/162 then you will come into it having a lot of prior understanding of some of the topics, which will make it easier for you to follow along with a low time commitment, so that is probably fine to take with 186 and 170. I haven&#39;t taken 169, so I can&#39;t speak to it.
