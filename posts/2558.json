I would say that if you have a 3.2&#43;, you have a decent shot at declaring if you have a strong personal statement detailing why you think you weren&#39;t able to meet the 3.3 cap and also you want to portray your interest in CS. Perhaps talk about side projects, your experiences with CS-related work (lab assisting, internships), etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have a 3.1&#43;, I would say it&#39;s a lot harder to declare but still not impossible.
