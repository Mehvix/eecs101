However, historically a large number of students (several hundred) have dropped the class in the first few weeks, especially after seeing HW2 which will be released this coming week. Assuming this semester is the same, you should be in a pretty good position to get in at #70. I&#39;d highly recommend keeping up with the lecture content and homework so you&#39;re caught up on everything if you do get in. I hope things work out!&#34;<br /><br />I&#39;d say 234 is probably a lot iffier but join the Piazza\u00a0 (where you can also ask questions) and keep up with the assignments as if you were in the class if you really want to take it! Shewshuk&#39;s said somewhere that ~150-200 people drop in a regular semester by HW2; I&#39;d assume that number&#39;s a bit lower this semester because it&#39;s a P/NP semester.
