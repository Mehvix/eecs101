Since my curriculum up to this point has been mostly focused on EECS, I wanted to dedicate some time next semester to taking classes in my other major. I have already completed the upper division unit requirements for the EECS degree, but I still need to take my natural science requirement and ethics requirement before I graduate. My question is whether\u00a0it&#39;s permitted that I take 1 EECS-related course next semester, given that the rules say the two technical course per semester requirement\u00a0is lifted when you reach your degree requirements? At this point, I&#39;m not sure taking more technical courses just for the sake of it would be good for me.</p>", "created": "2019-10-08T04:53:14Z", "subject": "When does the two technical per semester requirement stop applying in the EECS major?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k1hdc82q6y32c9", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10367, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545609682, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"j9ladzzp4wmh": 1524243875, "jyq487ctcwuk8": 1571117164}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9a8vasskl", "name": "Alex Thomas", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p9a8vasskl", "iscem14kbsu5vi"], "tags": ["eecs", "faculty_advising", "policy", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 442}
