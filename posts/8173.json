Many companies are looking for generalists, and especially in startups, a lot of it is learn-as-you-go.<br /><br />Also, this paragraph applies\u00a0largely to just startup companies. With all the jobs I&#39;ve gotten, they&#39;ve happened through networking.\u00a0And to do networking, it is through getting lucky with opportunities and taking advantage of them. I used to be really unsatisfied with the answer that networking happens through luck.

Then, I directly communicated with them to show that I was interested, and skipped the recruiter step.
