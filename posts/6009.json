But honestly, kudos to you for acknowledging your own weakness and seeking advice for how to address it. \n\nMost of us will start out learning a new concept by memorizing and you should not put yourself down so much because of it; what separates people is what happens after this initial step. Those that succeed are the ones that take the time and effort to practice applying this idea. There are many ways to do so: reviewing derivations and lines of reasoning that cumulates in this concept, finding problems and applying it to try and solve them, and so on. But the key point is that you have to force yourself to constantly think and use the ideas that you just memorized so that they become something you understand rather than committed to memory. \n\nAs for how best to prepare for CS70, I would not recommend Concrete Mathematics (assuming its the book by Knuth) because goes far beyond the scope of the class. One particular Art of Problem Solving (AOPS) book that isn&#39;t a bad choice is &#34;Volume 1: the Basics&#34;. Some of the content matches up with what is covered in 70, but it isn&#39;t capable of acting as a textbook or reference book for the class. It will, however, provide you more than enough of the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; for CS70. However this is something I would recommend if you were planning to take 70 in the Fall and had a summer break in between to prepare.\n\nIn all honesty, the best way to do well in CS70 is to take the class very seriously. There are a set of lecture notes written for the class that are fairly thorough, and what I would recommend for you to do is to:\n1. before lecture, read through the lecture notes. Don&#39;t focus too much on trying to understand every little detail, but do spend some effort getting familiar with the material\n2. Be attentive in lecture. Ask questions (or even better, write down your questions and try to think about it for a bit before trying to find a TA or asking Piazza for an answer)\n3. Go through the lecture notes and make yourself understand every single line in the notes. I would highly recommend that you even copy down the proofs and constantly ask yourself &#34;why is this true?&#34;\n(Out of these options, I would say that 3 is the most important)\n\nAs for discussions, I believe that the best way to approach it is to not go to discussion sections, and look at the problems yourself. Try and solve them all on your own without any help and then seek it if you need some. However this is an issue if you aren&#39;t good at keeping yourself on top of things, and so if that applies to you, going to discussion is still a good choice. \n\nFor homeworks, I believe that it was Professor Sahai that wrote on Piazza a very good way to approach it. I&#39;d recommend checking that out, and I would add one more thing: sitting and staring at a problem does not count as trying to solve it. If you are stuck, try something that you think might get you a solution, even if you aren&#39;t sure it will; if that fails, try again. Solving problems is literally just trial and error, you just keep on trying things until you get something that works.\n\nThat was a long bit.

I enrolled in math 55 a few years ago but it was so difficult for me at the start that I gave up towards the beginning and I intentionally no-passed it because I thought my math skills were too weak. I realized that throughout my k-12 education I never actually understood math, I just memorized formulas and stuff without fundamentally understanding anything. For example, It wasn&#39;t until 61b last semester that I realized that multiplication is actually just repeated addition when learning algorithmic complexity. I just knew how to multiply by rote memorization, not what it truly means mathematically. That&#39;s why I struggled so much in 55- my foundation of math is really weak. Now I decided to do a CS minor and thus take 70, and I&#39;m worried I don&#39;t have the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; because of this lack of proper education in grade school. What can I do to prepare myself for 70? Any suggestions of what I need to understand fundamentally (for example basic arithmetic operators) before I enter this course and any good resources or guidance on how to approach taking this class given my position ?
