Nobody in the real world cares. If you&#39;re looking for a software engineering job, having a second major in data science is useless. If you want to go into data science, major in it. Not sure? Pick one and take the classes that you&#39;re interested in for both (if you happen to fulfill all the requirements, then fine double major). It is so much more important to have personal projects/do work for clubs/research/TA (not necessarily all of them!) for your career. You also only have the opportunity to go to college once. You should take classes that you&#39;re interested in (within your major department and outside of it!) rather than wasting your precious time to add a few words to your degree.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-07-09T17:54:47Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-07-07T22:06:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>There was a question posed recently on using DS as a fallback in case the CS 3.30 gauntlet isn&#39;t passed.\u00a0 This is a fairly common thought, and it&#39;s a good fallback.\u00a0 I would say that if you&#39;re going to go so far as to take Data 8, you might as well double-major in Data Science. Learning how to double-dip (taking one class to fulfill 2 requirements) saves you time and money, if that&#39;s a goal of yours. One reason why is that many of the Data Science classes can be used to double-dip into your 7 breadth classes and your American Cultures required class.\u00a0 Not only that, 2 of the other classes can then overlap with CS classes.\u00a0 So if you really really plan well, it&#39;s possible you have as little as 3 extra classes in addition to Data 8 -&gt; Data 100 plus 2 other classes.
