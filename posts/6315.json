It has continued to evolve and now serves about half the Earth&#39;s population. We have learned a great deal since the advent of the World Wide Web and online social media and among the lessons are that the Internet can be abused in ways that produce social harm as well as social and economic good. Coping with this is an unsolved challenge. Further elaboration of the online world is already underway with the Internet of Things and the Interplanetary Internet. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is infusing the online world with new capabilities only dreamed of decades ago. In this talk, Vint Cerf will argue that the technical community has obligations to assure that these technologies are mostly constructive and that the hazards of their application are mitigated technically, legally, and socially.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vinton (Vint) Cerf is a celebrated computer scientist, described as one of the &#34;fathers of the Internet.&#34; He is most well known for creating the TCP/IP protocol suite with Robert Kahn. His awards and honors include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Technology, the Turing Award (sometimes referred to as the &#34;Nobel Prize of computer science&#34;), the Marconi Prize, the Japan Prize, as well as election into the National Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society as a foreign member (ForMemRS). Cerf was the founding president of the Internet Society. He was instrumental in the founding of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and served as its chairman. Cerf also served as President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). He currently serves on the National Science Board. Cerf is a Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist at Google.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-03-02T20:43:16Z", "subject": "Week 7: Undergraduate Announcements", "uid": "hz4ud741s6s1gn"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jeaeon3kl5i2zx", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6315, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550032681, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 806}
