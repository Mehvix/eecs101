There are some concepts in 70 that I still don&#39;t understand, even having taken the full course. I have yet to come across a concept in 61C that is as difficult as some of the concepts in 70, where you have to think for hours about it and still maybe not get it completely. Everything can be understood fairly easily, or after further explanation in discussion/OH.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, in terms of workload, I believe 61C outpaces 70, by far. In 70, you have these weekly homework assignments and midterms, and that&#39;s about it. Sure the homework is difficult, but with the right group of friends and smart usage of homework parties and office hours, they are doable. But 61C is a different beast. You will have weekly labs, weekly homework, almost weekly projects (in one span, we had 4 project assignments in 4 weeks), and two midterms (the second one is on the same week the intensive CPU project is due on). The pace is pretty breakneck; there is a lot of material to cover.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Anyways, that&#39;s my opinion. I believe both are hard in their own ways. But you may find yourself liking one or the other as the class styles are completely different.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2016-11-19T06:07:13Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>(a) Go over the textbook(s) to get a feel for the material, so it doesn&#39;t look unfamiliar when you see it in lecture</p>\n<p>(b) Try learning a bit of C on any of the ubiquitous &#34;code academy&#34;-style sites, it can&#39;t really hurt</p>\n<p>(c) Most importantly, relax well over the winter break - 61C is an unrelenting, intense class, so make sure you&#39;re well rested before the semester begins.</p><p>-------</p><p>Currently in 61C and I approve above message</p>", "created": "2016-11-18T22:22:20Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>(a) Go over the textbook(s) to get a feel for the material, so it doesn&#39;t look unfamiliar when you see it in lecture</p>\n<p>(b) Try learning a bit of C on any of the ubiquitous &#34;code academy&#34;-style sites, it can&#39;t really hurt</p>\n<p>(c) Most importantly, relax well over the winter break - 61C is an unrelenting, intense class, so make sure you&#39;re well rested before the semester begins.</p>", "created": "2016-11-18T21:55:44Z", "subject": "", "uid": "idril4bcgn84ac"}], "id": "ivobrb9rvshxu", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idgokdyabxc4fi", "name": "Rena Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2018_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2017_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2016_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "transfers_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hyq0c18svsu7ek", "name": "Sarah Van Nostrand", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijjuk3naptm72", "name": "Anish Saha", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idgokdyabxc4fi", "hyq0c18svsu7ek", "ijjuk3naptm72"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 11/13 - 11/19", "bucket_order": 190, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-11-19T10:59:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ivp3qqrgkf96a", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "I&#39;d read up on bitwise operators and C pointers.
