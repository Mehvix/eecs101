Currently 100 people on waitlist and 600 enrolled in class with total capacity of 950. At least 250 more enrollments needed before waitlist people need to start worrying, and even then generally you can conservatively expect at least 5-10% of enrolled students to drop in a class such as 61C (I may be wrong about this). It all depends on how enrollments look after phase 2 is mostly settled, but for now I&#39;d say you have a good shot.</p>", "created": "2019-08-01T19:38:21Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jyt30jwxfb94hl", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is9eiqabe2a548", "name": "Jasmeet Kaur Bhatia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is9eiqabe2a548"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-07-31T16:06:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What are the chances of getting into CS 61C if you are waitlisted within the 90s?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-07-31T16:06:07Z", "subject": "CS 61C Waitlisted", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jyrfzrtkmch6gb", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9934, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546126945, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 271}
