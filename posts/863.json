Neither major status nor class standing will impact enrollment at this point,&#34;\u00a0I was expecting my position on the waitlist to improve. But it hasn&#39;t.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So my questions are: Is Telebears actually updated over the weekend? Is Telebears glitching out? Am I being paranoid about this, and my position on the waitlist is actually better than it seems? Is Telebears updated daily? If so, does it update at midnight, or 7am?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And my low-key conspiracy question: Is the waitlist actually processed in order? Because Telebears says the waitlist will be processed\u00a0<em>manually</em> by the department, whereas I would think the waitlist would be processed\u00a0<em>automatically</em>. Also, the number of people on the waitlist is decreasing while the number enrolled in the class is increasing, yet my position on the waitlist isn&#39;t improving.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you for any comments and/or answers.
