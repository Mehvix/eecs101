However,\u00a0I love ML and classes like 134,\u00a0110, data 100, cs189(dropped later due to lack of prereq) and enjoyed solving tough questions from homework and discussing them with friends. But ironically, I also did not do well among those classes..... So, as a rising senior now, my GPA(around 3.4) definitely cannot support me for entering a Ph.D. program, even not a good master program, I guess. So, I&#39;m struggling should I insist on learning ML related course like 126, 127, 189 182 and pursuing a Master degree or just be more realistic to prepare for the software engineering\u00a0interview.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-07-06T04:30:28Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-07-06T23:23:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;ll provide another perspective.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve a lot of SWE experience with side projects/hackathons and I&#39;ve take CS C100/188/189/182 and the fundamental math/stats classes (mostly lower div).\u00a0I&#39;m currently doing an ML Engineer internship, officially SWE though, productionizing ML models at a big company I interned at last summer at which time I did full-stack web dev. <strong>My advice</strong> would be: although a lot of MLE positions want\u00a0at least a masters, you can still try to get a MLE position because companies doing applied ML might be more lenient and if that doesn&#39;t work out, get a SWE job and after some time try to do an internal transfer (which shouldn&#39;t be too hard) to a team that does SWE&#43;ML or just ML. My current work is\u00a0like the\u00a0second scenario since I was\u00a0originally assigned purely backend SWE work this summer but I asked to switch projects due to my interests in ML and my manager and mentor were supportive of that probably since they knew I was capable of good work from last summer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Other anecdotal advice</strong> I have is: if you don&#39;t want to go the SWE-&gt;MLE route, try aiming for MLE roles at startups which usually have more lenient hiring standards than established companies.

I&#39;d say the common thread among most of them is that they took a lot of related courses and were able to dabble in ML through some time in a research lab or with personal projects. My mentor was able to take a lot of what are now considered the &#34;canonical ML track&#34; courses (189, 126, 127) along with some more project- or reseach-focused classes (294-112, 294-131, what eventually became 182, etc).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, my mentor was very candid with me about how landing this position took a good amount of luck- he was doing plain old backend dev for a year until his current manager joined the company, provided a proof of concept for a deep learning project requiring extra headcount, and brought him along when he spun off a new partner team.
