This year was fairly challenging for me and I was only in Data 8 (Didn&#39;t have stats experience, not a &#34;difficult&#34; class per-se from popular opinion and I would agree) and EE16A (very time-consuming, no physics/linear algebra experience, couldn&#39;t pick up concepts quickly).

I am planning on taking 61B and DS100 in my sophomore Fall, and then just CS70 and some breadths in the sophomore spring.
