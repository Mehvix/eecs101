I am very comfortable with multivariate gaussians/random vectors from 189. I would say I have a pretty decent\u00a0understanding of topics like the Kalman Filter, the EM algorithm, MLE, MAP, HMMs, Discrete time markov chains and the Viterbi algorithm from 188, 70 and from prepping for 189. Would taking 126 be worth it post 189 with an A level understanding of the 189 material (and given my background)? I have no intention of doing signal processing or robotics,\u00a0and I will likely end up doing SWE or maybe ML/data science. Would 126 be helpful for SWE-esque jobs (like for navigation algorithm stuff)? And does 126 focus enough on the application topics (like the algorithms/topics mentioned above) to be directly useful in industry, or is it better for just nailing the fundamentals?</p>", "created": "2018-12-24T20:48:37Z", "subject": "usefulness of 126 post 189", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jq2snig6vyp7kt", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8463, "num_favorites": 5, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547727457, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5x7odf43ze772", "name": "Dhanush Patel", "photo": "1503736904_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j5x7odf43ze772/1503736904_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jr7v03k3lcd62s": 1549846242}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ip93c5oo19b4ei", "name": "Richard Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5cub7f76ir3cd", "name": "Shreyas Agarwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"ij26t89ebgo13n": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy5cby5q1ok", "name": "Alex Krentsel", "photo": "1473009784_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/icguy5cby5q1ok/1473009784_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrin4yxhispa", "name": "Lakshya Jain", "photo": "1474747210_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idrin4yxhispa/1474747210_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp", "j5x7odf43ze772", "ip93c5oo19b4ei", "j5cub7f76ir3cd", "icguy5cby5q1ok", "idrin4yxhispa"], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 561}
