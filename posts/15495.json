That being said, I think the one Econ class that is a comparable amount of work is Econ141 (Econometrics) so just keep that in mind. Also, bear in mind that a lot of the Econ classes will help you knock out some of the breadth requirements anyway (International Studies, Historical Studies, Social Sciences), so even taking 16 units a semester it&#39;s fairly straightforward to graduate on time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-08-12T15:32:07Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10367": 2, "12222": 8, "13287": 6, "1515": 3, "458": 7, "4673": 1, "5769": 4, "5770": 0, "6546": 5, "8374": 9}}, "created": "2021-08-12T01:24:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Hello everyone!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am an intended computer science student, I am also trying to double major in economics.
