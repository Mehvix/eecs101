I think CS majors must take a certain number of &#34;CS&#34; labelled UD classes, so taking CS 170 might be useful from that perspective, but when it comes to understanding material in hardware classes or getting you closer to doing research in hardware (which has the potential to be the most important part of any application to a graduate program in computer hardware or VLSI or something of that flavor) I&#39;ll say that CS 170 will not directly help you achieve any of that. If you haven&#39;t taken/satisfied the EECS lower divs yet, CS 61C in particular should tell you definitively whether you want to take the systems/computer architecture path outlined above (the class typically engenders strong feelings one way or another), while the EE 16 series will give a\u00a0<em>very\u00a0</em>basic introduction to circuits that should tell you whether you&#39;re interested enough in them to spend a few years dedicated to their study, after which EE 105 should provide a solid foundation moving forward (or entirely break your confidence, at which point you might be glad you took CS 170).
