I haven&#39;t taken too many non eecs classes but I enjoyed Math 113 as everything taught was completely new to me. I enjoyed having a class where I had zero prior\u00a0experience of the material and was learning new things every class. Note: I don&#39;t think Math 113 is useful to 99.99% of what most eecs/cs majors will do but I found the class fun nevertheless.</p>\n<p>Favorite non-theory class: CS162. I enjoyed understand how real computers operate and filling in the gaps between hardware and software (so I can now sort of understand a computer program starts from lines of codes and gets executed at the hardware level). I actually think that 162 should be a required class for eecs/cs majors due to its material but that&#39;s a slight tangent.\u00a0A big shoutout to my 162 group as well who made the class 10 times more enjoyable</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Honorable mentions for me would be 61C (nice lower division class that starts to fill in the gaps between hardware and software)\u00a0and EE126 (class really encourages tackling problems from different perspectives and covers an interesting range of probability topics).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "updated": "2019-08-15T18:27:13Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/11 - 8/17", "bucket_order": 43, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-16T01:53:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jzdgl5kcjxh2o0", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">my favorite class so far has probably been CS188! projects and homework were always fun, and the material was super interesting.

Would totally recommend Sug woo Shin if he\u2019s teaching! Another really cool course would be 189. The homework\u2019s were pretty hard but the material was extremely interesting and fun to learn.
