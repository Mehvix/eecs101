Any scheduling advice is appreciated and if the fall workload is a little too high, should I just push EE126 back to senior year? Also for those who are also interested in signal processing, are there any must take classes other than the ones listed above and EE123? Should I focus on getting research next year and pursue education after undergrad or will a bachelor&#39;s be enough to go into industry after I graduate?
