If the petition is received too late to review before instruction begins, COCI may still grant approval; however, the instructor will be required to hold the final exam at the originally scheduled exam group time as well as at the new exam group time. COCI will not consider petitions received after the fifth week of instruction. &#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So the question is basically no longer timely. Either instructor could --if asked-- decide at their own discretion (they are not responsible or obligated to do so) offer an alternate exam time for students with this (or other conflicts) if we could find sufficient space in Soda to do so (since campus rooms will be full of final exams given at their assigned times).</p>", "created": "2019-08-25T16:55:54Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i1i1qn178di2vn"}], "id": "jzr7s3rhahu3o9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "ireb05q4pq01oe": 1, "irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "name": "Nitzan Orr", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ir6sjtqw2e51rf"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-25T02:38:02Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I noticed to CS 162 and CS188 both have lecutre at the same time, and I was wondering if there would be any way to move exam dates according to overlapping lecture times confilicting.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-08-25T02:38:02Z", "subject": "CS 188 and CS162 lecture overlap", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jzqd4v8div66zf", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10103, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545982814, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 321}
