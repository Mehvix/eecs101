Trying to then give an ordering to the schools where there is a best school and a second best school, and so on\u00a0is such an empty? futile? subjective? venture. If you look at US news&#39;s rankings today you see that princeton is in first place and harvard is in second place. Are you convinced\u00a0princeton is a better school than harvard? If you go to harvard\u00a0will you think that you&#39;re not getting the best &lt;any of the qualities that make a good school, good&gt; as you would have received at princeton?</p>\n<p>How about if you go to the 3rd place school?...honestly, would you feel that had you gotten into a school higher on the list, then you&#39;d have gone to a &#34;better&#34; university? Can you honestly say that your education would have been better if you had gone to a &#34;better&#34; school?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t buy it. I don&#39;t see any truth in princeton being better than harvard or being better than Cal. It&#39;s just another school. And after all, we&#39;re each in only one or two or three majors. These rankings are for the school as a whole. I wouldn&#39;t trust them to tell me anything\u00a0about the quality of my education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or fine, let&#39;s look at the CS program rankings:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/computer-science\">https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/computer-science</a></p>\n<p>So if I got into the #1 university I&#39;ll get a better CS education than if I had gone to #5 or #7 on the list? Really? I don&#39;t buy it. That&#39;s why I believe their rankings can be dismissed. Now of course, you wouldn&#39;t go to some random college that opened up a year ago and expect them to have their CS program be as well run as in schools that have been in the business for like 40&#43; years. But randomly pick any school that you hear\u00a0people talk about and\u00a0it will be a fine school, if you personally like it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Basically, go to any university that you personally like and it will be fine. As long as you like the school, you can&#39;t go wrong by going to get a CS degree at, for example, UCSD instead of Stanford or CalTech or Berkeley. At the end of the day it comes down to what you do with the educational opportunities that are given to you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And here&#39;s some information about how they calculate the ratings for the top universities.</p>\n<p>The article by US news about how they rate colleges:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings\">https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It says that 22.5% of the ratings score comes from asking staff at each school about what they think of their own school. Ok...how&#39;s\u00a0what staff say going to tell me which is the best university?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Graduation and retention rates account for 22.5 percent. All the schools you hear about have good enough rates. Move on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And just look at their other metrics they use for rankings. I assure you that any school you&#39;ve heard of being commonly talked about is good enough in all the other metrics. Furthermore, there are even even schools that you know of that suck\u00a0in some of the metrics and they are still considered a \u00a0top school. Like Cal has bad CS class sizes and yet, we&#39;re fine here because we\u00a0make it work. And guess what, it&#39;s still a top school in their rankings.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here&#39;s another way to see it. I think it&#39;s a bit like picking a country to live in (assuming you know the language and culture of any country you choose).\u00a0Is living in the US better or worse than living in Canada or the UK? Is living in France better or worse than living in Switzerland? I mean, clearly living in\u00a0the US is better than living in some poor country in the middle of a war, but if someone came out with rankings about which countries are the best to live in, would you believe their rankings? I wouldn&#39;t. If they tell me italy is two places ahead of\u00a0germany or that Japan\u00a0is 5 places worse than Australia\u00a0I wouldn&#39;t believe them because they don&#39;t know enough. They can quantify rankings based on their own preferences but they can&#39;t tell me where is the best place for me to live . They&#39;re all good enough countries!\u00a0The best country for me to live in depends on my own preferences. And on top of that, it really depends where I live in said country, and how I live, and so many other factors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, have you noticed how each website that does rankings puts the schools in different (sometimes very different) order? Now tell me you believe those rankings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope this was coherent enough because I rushed through some of it since I have to study.

Btw I&#39;m not OP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just a few things I wanted to respond to:</p>\n<p>1. I suppose I take issue with the fact that yes, the rankings are opinions that could be plain wrong and yet, I think, ever since they&#39;ve started coming out annually, it&#39;s been\u00a0an obsessive race to get into the top universities. People take them to heart too seriously. So in a sense,\u00a0the fact that people take them so seriously, makes me want to hold them up to a high standard. But, at the end of the day, they are indeed just opinions of some people working at a news outlet. They never promised to be accurate. I should chill.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. There are over 2000 accredited universities in the U.S. so 27th position isn&#39;t bad at all. Though idk which rankings you&#39;re looking at because the us news one I&#39;m looking at puts its at 30th. But w/e it&#39;s somewhere in the 20s-30s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. You mentioned &#34;access to faculty&#34;. How can such a thing be measured? It&#39;s so...unscientific, and that makes me highly skeptical of rankings. Also, I should have been more specific and should have said &#34;I wouldn&#39;t trust them to tell me anything about the quality of my education in my major&#34;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. UCSD is known (for some reason) to be a good CS school, but it&#39;s not known (for some reason) to be as good as Cal, MIT, Stanford so I used it as an example of a school that&#39;s not revered as the best out there\u00a0but is still great (as far as its reputation goes).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5.\u00a0The schools that you hear commonly about (living in CA) aren&#39;t all ranked highest. UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara aren&#39;t regarded super highly in rankings but you hear about them a lot.\u00a0I&#39;m sure they have decent grad and retention rates. Nitpicking who has a few percent higher here or there doesn&#39;t matter. They&#39;re all great. Seriously, if your school makes it to the us news rankings, how worse can it possibly be compared to the top 30 in the rankings? Also, UT austin is 56 in the rankings and you\u00a0see it as highly ranked--so yeah, whatever. the 56th position is also great. And so is 57th and 58th and so on. I really think if a school is known\u00a0enough to be in the top 100 it&#39;s good. As long as enough people (students, faculty, and administrators) apply to be part of learning, teaching, and managing the school, it will be a good place b/c the school will be able to pick the best people out of those who apply. And the cycle of greatness kicks off from there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6. teacher-student ratio is actually one of the metrics they use to rate schools. What I&#39;m saying is that we have a bad ratio in 61A and other classes and yet we&#39;re totally fine academically. And, we&#39;re still\u00a0getting good rankings\u00a0despite that. Personally, I don&#39;t care too much about teacher-student ratio because that&#39;s the average of the school and vary greatly between different classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you for the discussion everyone.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-04-23T04:15:08Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-20T19:29:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j1qswd3p5qwf5", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Also wondering about this since you&#39;d think that the best CS program teaches CS much better than at other schools, or that maybe the best CS program has the best professors, or the most resources for its students. But do we really learn CS at Cal better than at some other UC? Are the professors here better at teaching than at other schools?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sure, we have notable people on the faculty team, but does that really translate to having a CS program that&#39;s better than at other schools? Is the access to some of the best minds in the world really the thing that makes\u00a0students&#39; learning experience\u00a0better here than at other UCs? Do other UCs not also have great faculty?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps our high ranking is caused by the fact that this is\u00a0a selective university (because a ton of students\u00a0apply yet\u00a0there&#39;s limited space) so naturally only the top performers get admitted, thereby making this university appear it has a good CS program even though it&#39;s merely the students who are top-notch as a whole, and can accomplish more, on average.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d like to draw a connection to elementary/middle/high schools in my neighborhood: some of them are known to be &#34;good schools&#34; because of high test scores or whatnot. So does that mean they are better at teaching? Are the teachers better there? Or is it just that these &#34;good schools&#34; are in better parts of town and so the students who attend these schools are more privileged and have the resources to focus on their education?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think the same thing is happening at Cal and at any other\u00a0university that receives a lot of applicants: There&#39;s limited space so only the top people (however you want to define it) are admitted. When you have a bunch of top people in a school, naturally it&#39;s better. Naturally, great achievements happen at that school. Naturally, more people want to apply because they hear about the school&#39;s achievements. Naturally, more professors want to apply. Naturally, the school only lets the top professors in. Naturally, those top students\u00a0graduate and as a whole make more money. Naturally, those top-notch alumni can donate more money back to the school. Naturally, the school has more money to fund its\u00a0amazing students and professors. Naturally, it&#39;s a &#34;great school&#34;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now of course, this cycle has to start somewhere. I believe that it\u00a0started because this university, and so many other &#34;top&#34; universities,\u00a0are old and have had time to grow. And then when other universities pop up, naturally,\u00a0prospective students\u00a0are skeptical of them until they&#39;re established, and so prospective students\u00a0naturally apply to established universities before they consider the newly created institutions. Naturally, this more established university has a lower admittance rate than newer universities. Naturally, a lower admittance rate gives off the vibe it&#39;s a better place, and naturally the university can only admit the top applicants who achieve more, on average, than students at less selective universities. And there, we&#39;re in that cycle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Key realization: When &#34;top&#34; universities go around the county encouraging\u00a0students to apply, it&#39;s not because they need to get their name out and convince students that they are good universities. They are already well known. Everyone already knows they&#39;re Ivy league or whatever.\u00a0I believe it&#39;s mainly to get more people to apply so they can boast lower admittance rates. Because, come on now, you can&#39;t tell me you haven&#39;t looked at the admittance rate of a school to\u00a0see &#34;how good&#34; it is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure my opinion is not shared by all. I&#39;m looking for further discussion and to possibly change my views on the matter :)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-04-20T19:29:19Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/16 - 4/22", "bucket_order": 239, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/16 - 4/22", "bucket_order": 239, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-20T21:30:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j1qx893po7o37u", "subject": "<p>&#43;1</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2017-04-20T21:30:33Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-20T19:51:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j1qtofybaob55d", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>2.
