I&#39;ve always been a more hands-on person and I love building apps. I was wondering what courses are suitable for me in terms of real-world applications of ML/DL. I&#39;m currently considering IEOR 135 but it is completely full. I&#39;m also enrolled in Data 100 for next semester but i&#39;m not quite sure how real-world application is this class. I heard that IEOR has several hands-on data science courses, so if anyone has taken any of them, could you recommend them?\u00a0<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />P.s.
