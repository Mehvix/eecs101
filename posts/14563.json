One strategy you could try is having a graduate TA / research mentor who knows you well ghostwrite a letter through the relevant professor (i.e. the professor is the one that submits the letter and does some stylistic editing on it, but the grad student writes the bulk of it). Of course, you might not even be in the position to do that. I guess my only recommendation in that case is to start going to professor office hours (that&#39;s what they&#39;re for, especially in upper-divs). TA office hours are objectively more useful, but I digress...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Certainly do your best to apply to programs like this if you have the time. An alternative is to do summer research here (not through any special program and probably not paid) so that you can get your foot in the door for later opportunities (e.g. REUs, grad school in general). To get started with that, you could email postdocs and senior grad students in the department here or at LBNL working on projects you find cool.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh19bukde2t2", "name": "Zeyi (Jackson) Yan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh1o4gncg37f", "name": "Venkata (Vishal) Pulugurtha", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzdh19bukde2t2", "jzdh1o4gncg37f"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-03-21T03:57:34Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "seen": {"12366": 5, "13641": 7, "14173": 0, "14498": 8, "3163": 9, "3778": 6, "4888": 4, "5918": 3, "6596": 2, "8787": 1}}, "created": "2021-03-19T02:46:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["research", "eecs", "enrichment_opportunities", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi I am currently a sophomore studying EECS and applying to research positions for the summer.
