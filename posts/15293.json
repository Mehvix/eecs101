I guess if you don't have any of 188/189/182/127/126, 188 is better than nothing. However, some labs might want more than just that. In my experience, labs will like 189/182 so that you know what a \"machine learning\" is. CS170 is just good to have, but basically everyone has it, so don't expect to be competitive with just an A/A+ in 170. \n2. It might help in any interviews, but I don't really think it gets you through the initial screening. However, if you get to the interviews and they ask you questions, you might need this information.\n3. Depends on the lab. In my experience these are generically good tools: pytorch, tensorflow (1.x and 2.x are both relevant in some cases), huggingface, aws, google cloud, numpy, generic python, regex, C/C++, Cuda. You don't need all of these tools and it really depends on what stage the lab is in in the research. You might need systems/ networking experience for something training pipelines.\n4. Those projects are pretty lean, so they don't really matter that much. Those intro courses can be useful if you get like A+'s in all of them, it will catch someone's eye. The standard courses like 182/189 have nice projects to put on resumes. 194-080 has a good one as well (might not be offered next year)\n5. I mean, idk how much you can do without any ML experience from a course right away. If you tackle some interesting problem and have meaningful results, it will look good. Maybe contribute to some well known repo on github? imo, personal projects are hit or miss depending on what was achieved. Best thing to have is a good github and meaningful results or a cool website for the project potentially if its for research.\n6. in my experience, i've never had to do leetcode for ML internships or ML research. I would touch up on multivariate calculus, advanced probability, linear algebra, and optimization.  </md>", "created": "2021-06-30T17:47:30Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kqjrugolye35t", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1614803853, "ke52edydthi5ba": 1605851998, "kju357ef8ma5fd": 1610650361}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k0wplo7nzcb3wp", "name": "Rajit Rajpal", "photo": "1587886315_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/k0wplo7nzcb3wp/1587886315_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["k0wplo7nzcb3wp", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "md"}, "created": "2021-06-30T21:16:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kqjzbr0h14y5x4", "subject": "<md>Mine does.

Does taking CS 188 this fall help, esp. for getting into research labs? Will it only help after I&#39;ve completed the course? Am I better off skipping it and taking perhaps some other relevant courses (which ones)? Or is taking CS170 enough?\n\n2. Does taking online courses (Udemy, Coursera) in relevant topics help in getting into research labs? \n\n3. What are some skills I need to (definitely) have, in terms of technical skills especially, to get into these labs?\n\n\n\n4. Which courses might have in-class projects that could help me? So far I&#39;ve only taken cs61a/cs61b in terms of courses with significant projects, and I&#39;m not sure if those projects are enough to help me get noticed (as in getting internships (or at least interviews)) in fall. \n\n5. If I can&#39;t take the courses you recommend right away, should I focus on personal projects? (or are there other ways to get around perhaps not having too many projects under my belt? \n\n6. Does leetcode help for non-software engineering positions like ML? Are there other (perhaps even more relevant) prep resources for ML/data?\n\nThank you in advance for all your advices!", "created": "2021-06-30T08:40:12Z", "subject": "ML / data research or internship in fall?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kqj8amlsf2v4a1", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 15293, "num_favorites": 6, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654540166266, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeun3n6ef0vj", "name": "Kevin Han", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0uzrf4qa58p", "name": "Abel Yagubyan", "photo": "1612575162_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jwu0uzrf4qa58p/1612575162_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbeun3n6ef0vj", "jwu0uzrf4qa58p"], "tags": ["eecs", "research", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 559}
