Something about the feel of the college meta made me only see things all the way through if it was a class I was taking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Up to you! Some say it&#39;s boring, but maybe you&#39;ll feel cool being able to do 16 seconds of repetitive work in 8 seconds of fancy thinking work. Just my opinion, nothing wrong with trying it out and dropping it later (hopefully you&#39;ll at least feel guilted into learning tidbits here and there).</p>", "created": "2017-09-24T06:47:50Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hqh260v1q7yfc"}], "id": "j7ydttt3ep23p6", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p759ji5o5ws", "name": "Vera Wang", "photo": "1529996635_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p759ji5o5ws/1529996635_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iscem14kbsu5vi", "is6p759ji5o5ws"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-09-22T21:42:48Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "lscs", "faculty_advising", "cs-intended", "policy"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "I&#39;m taking CS9E, a self paced computer science class this semester.\n\nThe class is one semester long, but their is an option where you can receive an incomplete for the first semester you take it and then complete the work the next semester and get a grade.\n\nHow would this look on my transcript?\n\nWould the incomplete be erased once I complete the work?\n\nI don&#39;t want an incomplete marking on my transcript :(\n\nThanks!", "created": "2017-09-22T21:42:48Z", "subject": "Receiving an Incomplete grade in a self-paced CS class", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j7wex1xevaw5d", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5034, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654551336768, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "faculty_advising", "lscs", "policy", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 336}
