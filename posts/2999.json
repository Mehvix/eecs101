The material you learn in CS 70 and Math 53/54 is sufficient for all CS and econ upper divs. You will not encounter a new theorem or develop a specific skill in Math 110 that you will be able to &#34;apply&#34; to any of your future classes. That being said, some classes may indeed help you succeed in your upper divs by giving you more exposure to a way of thinking. CS 189 is basically all linear algebra, and part of succeeding in that class is becoming comfortable with matrices and their basic properties, like rank and eigenvalues. The more time you spend working with matrices and vector spaces, the more comfortable you will feel tackling the material in CS 189, and that is the extent to which Math 110 is &#34;applicable&#34;. Another class which might be helpful in the same way is Stat 134 (or EE 126, which I am told is a very similar class?). Even though you&#39;ll never see any of the material past midterm 1 in any more of your classes going forward, having that experience working with difficult probability distributions may give you a bit of a leg up on your peers who&#39;ve maybe only taken CS 70 or Stat 20 when you go into CS 188/189 or Econ 101A/136/141.</p>", "created": "2017-01-08T08:19:46Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hzd1nhoxlog51j"}], "id": "ixoe2ex22oh15n", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-04T18:51:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!
