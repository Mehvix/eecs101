The compbio module went over the basics of parsimony-based phylogeny and alignment algorithms (Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch). Because basically no one in the class has any CS background, the professor also spent awhile covering the basics of time complexity at a 61B sort of level. These topics are all covered again both more quickly and in more detail in 170/176, so depending on your perspective it&#39;s either a nice preview or redundant. There wasn&#39;t any programming at all. It is definitely entirely microbial (and specifically mostly prokaryotes) so you might be missing some details about eukaryotic/multicellular genetics, but I believe it goes into more detail about -omics techniques than 140 does, and I think if you&#39;re interested in compbio that could be useful to you too. It doesn&#39;t have biochem as a prereq, so there&#39;s probably less detail about pathways than you&#39;d get in 140.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And re: Math 127, I enjoyed that class too and in retrospect I learned a lot, but I agree with the person above me that the class structure was very disorganized and it was pretty stressful at the time.
