Of all of the UD CS courses 170 and 162 are probably the most core courses to take, and 162 material will pop up in interviews and/or on the job for most people. 170 is just generally a good class to take since it dips into many areas of CS, is relevant for interviews (not so much for the actual job), and builds on your ability to solve problems. After these, in terms of &#34;employability&#34; which I take to mean standard SWE or developer job, I&#39;d suggest 161, 186, 168 (I would suggest 160 for front-end dev jobs, but nobody gets to take it without priority enrollment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, if you graduate from Berkeley CS you are by default &#34;employable,&#34; it&#39;s not super important that you take a certain set of classes.
