In each of my first 3 semesters I essentially only took 1 technical per semester and just took breadths with the 61A/B/70 series (other than taking math 1B with 61B but I wouldn\u2019t really count that as a technical). I am also not one of the people who intuitively gets lots of concepts, on the contrary I usually spend tons of time on classes just to kind of get on a level playing field. Next semester I am considering taking a few potential classes in combination with 170. I really feel I should take 170 in Spring 2019 to help with recruiting for internships in fall 2020. These are my potential schedules:</div><div><br /></div><div>\u00a0170 with EE16A (if 170 ends up allowing alternative final exams)\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Or\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>170 with 61C (I am potentially worried this might be too difficult for me because it will be my first time taking 2 technicals and these are supposed to be a very difficult combo. However, I definitely don\u2019t procrastinate (I try to start homework/projects the day I get them or soon after). I also am very tempted by, and am sort of leaning towards, this schedule because many upper divs require or at least suggest 61C as a pre-requisite so I think taking 61C in Spring 2019 would give me a lot more flexibility in terms of what classes I can take in upcoming semesters.</div><div><br /></div><div>Or</div><div><br /></div><div>170 with one of the \u201clowest\u201d workload upper div CS classes. I was considering taking 188 with 170 but their finals are separated by 1 hour and since both of these classes are supposed to have difficult exams , in combination with the fact that I usually feel brain dead after just 1 final, I am kind of scared of this option. Some of the other \u201clow\u201d workload upper divs like 161 and 168 say you should take 61C before them, and other upper divs like 160 that don\u2019t require 61C seem to still be pretty high workload, which might be difficult with 170. I was also looking into 194 classes but the only one that seems to be offered next semester is cryrography which seems like it will probably be pretty difficult and the professor recommends taking 170 before it.</div><div><br /></div><div>If anyone could offer me some advice, personal perspectives on taking some of these combinations (especially 170 with 61C), or any suggestions, I would really appreciate it!!</div>", "created": "2018-10-13T01:32:45Z", "subject": "Questions about potential schedules for next semester", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jn6rnqkglwoq1", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 7802, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548482742, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "lscs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 490}
