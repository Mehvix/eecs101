I&#39;d say the &#39;suggested&#39; (but longest) route is to AI (because this is attainable; there&#39;s no filtering out through\u00a0the application), then CSM, then tutor/reader, then TA. However, at any point you could jump to any of the different steps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For me, I joined CSM as a sophomore, and the same semester was accepted to be a tutor for the same class I was teaching for CSM. The next year, I became a TA for the same course. I spent a year teaching that class before deciding to switch to another course (a common occurrence). For the lower divs, a lot of it is random chance, unfortunately. For instance, I started at tutor and moved to TA after two semesters; other people spend 1-2 semesters more before getting a tutor position. Others go straight to TA. It all really depends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But to answer your question:</p>\n<p>1) You should take CS370; I have heard very good things, and as someone who\u00a0has been involved in the CSM recruitment&#43;course staff hiring process,\u00a0we do consider\u00a0it a\u00a0positive.</p>\n<p>2) I would highly recommend joining CSM (though it has gotten more competitive unfortunately) for its community of people in CS who teach, and for its systematic curriculum which helps build good teaching practices. It&#39;s\u00a0not that it&#39;s always clear who\u00a0amongst upper-div TAs have received &#39;formalized&#39; training through CSM or other experience, and who are simply really great students, but certainly those of us who went through CSM all have a strong foundation and many have a genuine passion for teaching (which I have found to be a large factor in being a good TA).</p>\n<p>3) If it&#39;s too late for you to do either of those things this semester, AI for\u00a0a course you&#39;re interested in teaching. There are also other teaching clubs; ANova, BEAM, OASES, etc<br /><br />Something I&#39;d ask is: why do you want to become a TA?\u00a0Is it to improve the student experience? Do you just want it for your resume? Would you like to learn the material more deeply? Is it the salary? Being a TA is\u00a0an incredibly rewarding experience, and as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve felt yourself, good TAs can make or break your semester. I&#39;d encourage you to consider your own reasons since you seem to be set on becoming a TA.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c1t15tw6t", "name": "Jonathan Lu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke2c1t15tw6t"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-01-12T15:33:57Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-12T11:16:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k5axb65vlp8294", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>How long does it usually take one to become a TA? and what courses/work experience do they pursue to do so?
