I&#39;m a hardware person myself and I regret taking this class only because I could have filled it with something else I would have enjoyed like 105. I only felt the content up to the second midterm had some relevance but its really theoritical with a small project at the end which is somewhat practical but only worth 5%.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EECS151: Prolly the class to take if you wanna do digital design. It is also one of the hardest class I&#39;ve ever taken at Cal since its 5 units. The 2 unit lab which is seperate is a beast of itself, especially the final project. Verilog is a pain in the ass to debug but you learn so much from the labs more than the lectures. This class is the class to take which will immensely help you in recruiting, especially in the fall. Personally, I got recruited from this class alongside 4-5 of my other friends to Apple and other hardware companies (Nvidia, Qualcomm, Citadel, etc) because they all love this class for some reason. When I say recruit I dont mean like career fair recruiting, its actually the company tellin us to drop our resumes in their special form tailored for students in 151.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE192: A project based class where the entire semester you work on designing a RC motor car to race in the NATCAR competition. I&#39;d say this class is extremely hard (maybe even more since it&#39;s remote rn) since hardware debugging can be super painful and writing embedded systems in C is also a pain in itself to debug. But the project is super interesting and definitely resume worthy since you&#39;re combining multiple classes of EECS into 1 big project (parts of 149, 128, 127, 61C).
