I am a data science major and would like to take the course in order to fulfill my probability requirement. I am interested in EECS 126 because of its applications to machine learning and to help prepare me to take CS 189 Fall 2022.\n\nThe reason I am worried about taking this class is because I took CS 70 this past summer (Summer 2021) and got absolutely thrashed. Despite spending a TON of time and effort on the class, I ended up with a B-.\n\nI am not sure if I would get a lot out of taking a class like Data C140 after having taken CS 70, but I am honestly not sure if I could handle EECS 126, given how much I struggled in CS 70.  Furthermore, I have heard that EECS 126 is basically the most challenging EECS course that is offered. However, it is true that the classes I am planning on taking alongside EECS 126 next semester are not necessarily super challenging (Data 100, UGBA 147, and UGBA 106). \n\nWould love honest and direct feedback! :)", "created": "2021-09-27T01:34:43Z", "subject": "Advice on whether or not I should take EECS 126", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "ku1za9m27f64r9", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 15745, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539671155, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 344}
