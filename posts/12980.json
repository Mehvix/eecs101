I have to admit this combo is a little bit overwhelming even only taking these two tech courses, but not impossible to handle if you are comfortable with long math problem sets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Homework set</strong>: Both have long and hard homework sets. Both of them took way more time to finish than my math 110&#39;s homework set. Going to OH&#39;s extremely helpful for both courses.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Labs</strong>: Only 126 has labs. 8 or 9 labs. Not bad in general. Some will take longer to finish since the concepts are hard to digest.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Midterm</strong>: Both have 2 midterms. Both hard. PLAN EARLY. In my semester, 170 and 126&#39;s 1 and 2 midterms are in separate weeks which made things a little bit better.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Project</strong>: Both have a final team project. Will eat up several weeks after Thanksgiving. I&#39;m very lucky to have some great teammates so it&#39;s not bad. But my friends aren&#39;t so lucky and complained a lot about the team dynamic.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">126&#39;s very important if you want to do 189 in the future. Also, this was two years ago, course content might change; things might be different due to the online format.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, It&#39;s definitely a very fulfilling semester and I learned a lot! But looking back, I kind of hope that I could separate these two courses, especially because both courses cover tricky and important concepts that need time to digest if it&#39;s one&#39;s first time seeing them(DM, reductions in 170; HMC, MLE/MAP, kalman filter in 126). I remembered clearly that I found some topics extremely intriguing but had to strategically NOT diving too deep into it so that I could have even time for reviewing the final for both courses.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just my two cents. Hope it helps!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>", "created": "2020-08-22T17:12:29Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j3jk4zjmiay6xs"}], "id": "ke5x7n0jv7cam", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhhvcy9d3zb", "name": "nathan zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvf2lru9f43k", "name": "Ahmed Shehata", "photo": "1568535511_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvf2lru9f43k/1568535511_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j51gxcqxjxc1zy", "name": "Ganeshkumar Ashokavardhanan", "photo": "1527237927_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j51gxcqxjxc1zy/1527237927_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzqdhhvcy9d3zb", "jktvf2lru9f43k", "j51gxcqxjxc1zy"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-08-22T23:05:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ke69t4xndzpwe", "subject": "61C was really time consuming for me (perhaps more so than 126) because the projects are pretty tedious, and I spent a ton of time fixing bugs.
