After all, what could possibly be a better preparation?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, this perspective is dangerously wrong. \u00a0First, reading problems and solutions is generally a horrible idea. It has none of the benefits of actually doing problems. Second, it has all the harms of interfering with your ability to learn how to reason about something that you haven&#39;t seen before. Third, it creates opportunities for you to propagate bad form and cement\u00a0distortions that arise from conceptual gaps --- this is because instead of learning the concepts, skills, and ways of thinking that we are teaching you, it is possible to simply learn how to do these particular problems. Because you have no guidance or study group or any other resource that is normal during the semester, there is nothing to stop this. Then, when you experience the course itself, this half-bad understanding will actually seem to carry you through. It is far better for you to actually experience challenge that points out what you don&#39;t understand so that you can actually understand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, what should you do if you want to be proactive and prepare ahead of taking a course? First, make sure you have the prereqs. That should go without saying. After that, try your hand at material that exercises the same basic underlying skills but is fundamentally different. For 70, that would be doing things like going through every problem in the textbook by Rosen. Or reading How To Prove It by Vellemen and doing the exercises within that. This will avoid interfering with the ability of the actual course 70 from helping you while still giving you a strong leg up.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-06-01T00:35:43Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "j3dowbi7woy3pf", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrikwpr31m46c", "name": "Nithi Narayanan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8idxhub7pd", "name": "Daniel Zhang", "photo": "1471923062_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p8idxhub7pd/1471923062_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hc6qtswtj87bi", "name": "Ye Wang", "photo": "1521329882_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/hc6qtswtj87bi/1521329882_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"j6bczj0pmoo4mk": 1512978965}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8z72291ay", "name": "Pancham Yadav", "photo": "1504631008_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p8z72291ay/1504631008_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijj65y73ymb5i", "name": "Amy Mendelsohn", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipf2ezhjrt956a", "name": "Urvi Guglani", "photo": "1520734378_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ipf2ezhjrt956a/1520734378_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "ij5ddqc0arp6r4": 1, "ijaiqhfuhrc31e": 1, "ixtb5qkalsx6yo": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijjujonuuj57nk", "name": "Jayanth Sundaresan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "name": "Erick Quintanilla", "photo": "1612158069_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/irdxxfmolfj6tn/1612158069_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzab6kpr3c048h", "name": "Justin Luke", "photo": "1473540382_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/hzab6kpr3c048h/1473540382_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p71kv5uj5u0", "name": "Jason Ji", "photo": "1529626801_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p71kv5uj5u0/1529626801_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100005394402714", "id": "hktwxo5q8h547h", "name": "Max Kanwal", "photo": "1523295706_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/hktwxo5q8h547h/1523295706_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p759ji5o5ws", "name": "Vera Wang", "photo": "1529996635_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p759ji5o5ws/1529996635_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"jjnjp9mea54uy": 1536696387}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy6ln9pj1pi", "name": "Srinivasa Pranav", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jz9gltnmf1358i", "name": "Andrew Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idriks20rqg42v", "idrikwpr31m46c", "is6p8idxhub7pd", "hc6qtswtj87bi", "is6p8z72291ay", "ijj65y73ymb5i", "ipf2ezhjrt956a", "ijjujonuuj57nk", "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "hzab6kpr3c048h", "is6p71kv5uj5u0", "hktwxo5q8h547h", "is6p759ji5o5ws", "icguy6ln9pj1pi", "jz9gltnmf1358i"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-05-31T20:22:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m planning on taking CS70 this summer.
