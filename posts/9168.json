However, due to the difficulty of the course (and how abstract they go at times), some linear algebra background is definitely necessary, namely knowing how to do the computation (as this class doesn&#39;t focus on that aspect much). As someone who&#39;s taken EE16ab (and TA&#39;d for one of them) and who&#39;s taken Math 110, there isn&#39;t much overlap between 16b and 110. If anything, 110 just barely mentions SVD at the very end of the class, and that&#39;s about it. I never took Math 54, so majority of my background was 16a linear algebra, and that was fine for me. The real question is if you feel like you have developed &#34;mathematical maturity.&#34; After having taken CS 70, CS170, and other EECS math-y courses, I didn&#39;t have too much worry, but you would have to judge that for yourself for you own situation.</p>", "created": "2019-04-16T19:52:30Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "juk7els7qim7os", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-15T19:00:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Just wondering if this is a good/feasible idea", "created": "2019-04-15T19:00:18Z", "subject": "Math 110 with ee 16b", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "juiq3msg2tl48g", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9168, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546901364, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "name": "Owen Bai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6nu3l1tkcr3k5"], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 238}
