[I took CS 70 in Summer 2016]</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although many argue that it moves too fast, there really is a lot more time during the summer to digest the material with students taking usually only 1 class, and more time to go to OH and HW parties (definitely go to HW parties) for conceptual help. In addition, there will be about ~8 (7-8 questions) HW sets in the summer vs. ~14 (4-6 questions) HW sets during the semester. I also find weekly problem sets more annoying to manage during the semester when there are a lot more classes and activities going on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I also personally like CS 61B&#39;s structure during the semester (not lab based) and the professors who teach the course during the semester are fantastic. Furthermore, people argue that 61B with Hilfinger (Fall) has a better grade distribution since your grade is more weighted on projects than exams.</p>", "created": "2018-05-06T23:27:56Z", "subject": "", "uid": "idgol91mae252p"}], "id": "jgvg6rjus7g4v1", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jc8cjjf8zxt5m3", "name": "Jun", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"j6qou0qn1ehl8": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p76f9fry5xt", "name": "Kyle Cripps", "photo": "1471931092_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p76f9fry5xt/1471931092_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jc8cjjf8zxt5m3", "is6p76f9fry5xt"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-06T22:56:48Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I could not find a clear answer to this question.
