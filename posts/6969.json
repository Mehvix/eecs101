But good news! It is easy and fast to claim your Berkeley.edu account.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What happens after I register with &#64;cal?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Once the registration form has been submitted, you will be asked to accept the user policy for your Berkeley.edu account. After accepting the user policy, your registration is processed and you can claim your Berkeley.edu address. Allow 24 hours for this new account to be created and a notification email delivered to the email used for registration.</p>\n<p>Need help registering? Contact\u00a0<a href=\"https://cal.berkeley.edu/help/\">&#64;cal Support</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I keep my attachments, emails and files?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Good news! As long as your account is active when you register, there will be no changes to your account when you register with &#64;cal and claim your alumni email. Alumni have nine months after graduating to convert their student account to an alumni account and retain all files and attachments. After nine months, alumni may claim their student email address (provided it matches their CalNet ID), but there is no guarantee that attachments or files will be accessible.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What happens if I don\u2019t register my student email address?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Since the account is free, and registration is easy, consider keeping your student email. Alumni have nine months after leaving Berkeley to convert their student email account to an alumni account with the same address, attachments, emails, and files. If the account isn&#39;t claimed, it will be shut down and attachments, emails, and files are deleted.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>I\u2019m undecided. Can I get a\u00a0<em>Berkeley.edu</em>\u00a0account after the deadline?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Sure! You will be able to get your student email reactivated. Just complete\u00a0<a href=\"https://cal.berkeley.edu/registration/\">the registration process</a>\u00a0whenever you are ready and confirm the user policy.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>If I am registered with &#64;cal as a student, do I have to register again to claim my alumni email?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Congratulations! If you registered with &#64;cal as a student and\u00a0<a href=\"https://cal.berkeley.edu/alumni_email/\">claimed your email address in our email service launched in November 2016</a>, your email account will be available to you after graduation.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>", "created": "2018-05-09T22:12:11Z", "subject": "Graduates Keeping Berkeley Email Address", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jgznswl9ww9679", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6969, "num_favorites": 30, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549311526, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1581210147, "jziyku5gomy7aq": 1576285183, "k0g9j3r04edcn": 1575391697, "k5eevxebzpj25b": 1579570570, "k5g56y7yegw5xr": 1581284108}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jy1rz92rpon1wh", "name": "Akshit Dewan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jy1rz92rpon1wh"], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 929}
