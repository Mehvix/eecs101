Join us in our first iteration of the ANova College Mentorship Decal! As a mentor, you will be paired up with a high school senior from an under-resourced school in the Bay Area. Each week, you will meet with your mentee virtually (i.e., Zoom, phone, email, etc.) and advise them on the whole college application process. Example responsibilities include providing feedback on essays, helping with scholarship applications, and giving insights into different majors/career pathways. \n\nThis 1-unit DeCal aims to give you hands-on experience with mentorship through the program. The course will also include weekly mini-lectures and peer-to-peer discussions whose goal is to make you a more effective mentor. \n\nWe are looking for a variety of majors and experiences! The only prerequisite is a desire to support those going through the college application process, especially since these students often lack the resources provided in more affluent areas. \n\nTo learn more, check out our DeCal page.
