This could often be done just by referring back to the slides/book and implementing a procedure from there, with some optimization and debugging.<br /><br />The design of the project is almost completely done for you, so a lot of the design thinking is reading and understanding the relevant existing code, as well as a bit of thinking about what direction they want you to pursue in implementing your functions. This is not really designing a major component of the program yourself, which I would consider essential to a design course.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "h5zxso82nn85q8", "updated": "2016-04-20T09:36:16Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-04-20T01:06:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>I just took it and it doesn&#39;t feel like one.</p>", "created": "2016-04-20T01:06:26Z", "subject": "Why/how is 186 considered a &#34;major design experience&#34; course?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "in85s4d7r37cw", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 1250, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654555457338, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz5sg8zcrh05c", "name": "Brandon Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "idm0mkujnvq4vw": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktxrdax6z731z", "name": "Yujie", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hojtulodf7f519": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktwxngs3tf46s", "name": "Jing-Lun Edward Gao", "photo": "1423766221_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/hktwxngs3tf46s/1423766221_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hkn15d57o3z5px", "name": "Michael Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktwxpp9qln499", "name": "Andrew Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hz5sg8zcrh05c", "hktxrdax6z731z", "hktwxngs3tf46s", "hkn15d57o3z5px", "hktwxpp9qln499"], "tags": ["cs", "eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 317}
