We in the faculty have a bit more experience than you do about both how fields are evolving intellectually as well as just how much things can change with time. As a student, you don&#39;t really understand the bigger picture, especially the scope of change and the need for a robust development of different ways of thinking. Which is to be expected --- otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t need the university and could just go and read books and do projects on your own to learn. The answer so far (I have to go to a meeting) is basically of the &#34;trust us&#34; variety, and there is a strong case that such trust is actually fundamental to the student/teacher relationship. Everything we say will always have a dimension of &#34;trust us&#34; to it, because you do not understand or appreciate what you cannot yet fathom. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, it&#39;s the unknown unknowns that get you. \u00a0One of our goals is to make you more ready for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-03-20T22:07:53Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p><strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gro4nnkuub\">&#64;Elad Alon</strong> \u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-03-20T21:42:41Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek"}], "id": "j0in0gjr82v6o7", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idtiecbnamq7ff", "name": "Snaheth Thumathy", "photo": "1446078660_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idtiecbnamq7ff/1446078660_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"idsclwixj9j35z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "name": "Garrett Thomas", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jcfmstjtpxz2bp": 1523048468}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6lzfa695i6", "name": "Will Wang", "photo": "1569220944_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6lzfa695i6/1569220944_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ib2kjvzzgc61w2", "name": "Jessie Yang", "photo": "1473565160_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ib2kjvzzgc61w2/1473565160_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwb0nj3ghba30f", "name": "Rithvik Chuppala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idtiecbnamq7ff", "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "is6p6lzfa695i6", "ib2kjvzzgc61w2", "iscem14kbsu5vi", "jwb0nj3ghba30f"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-20T22:36:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>If I were to follow your logic, I would argue that R&amp;C/Breadth/HSS/AC requirements should be entirely removed from all science and engineering majors as those would have no impact nor benefit on the career of a computer scientist/engineer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>____________________________</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your issue is you&#39;re looking at 16AB as a circuits course, which while it teaches circuits it teaches skills more important than that, and ones that are relevant to a completely software based curriculum.

Many databases also fall into this category.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is absolutely vital for a CS student to know and be comfortable with reasoning about all three modes. The 61ABC series is heavily weighted towards (1) with a little bit of (3) mixed in during 61A. \u00a016AB bring more of (2) and (3) into the mix, and it is vital that this happen as early as possible in students&#39; development so that their mental muscles are more balanced in their development. This is why we absolutely urge 16AB to be taken by freshmen.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Within (2), there are many aspects to analog information processing. In 16A you see a little bit as well as how it connects via constraints to optimization-oriented thinking. However, in 16B the dynamic aspects also come into play. While today&#39;s deep neural networks tend to use circuits for information processing (circuits emulated by programs running SIMD cores for now, but more specialized cores in the future) in a way that doesn&#39;t involve time, there is every indication that biological neural networks do indeed invoke time dynamics in nontrivial ways. So it would be absolutely irresponsible of us to not give students some inclination of time-dynamic behavior of circuits as a part of their foundational training for a 40 year career. This is why the department wants everyone taking 16A and 16B.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fundamentally, EECS has two pillars: information and computation. All students need grounding in both even if they may choose to specialize in one more than the other. But they need to start with mental balance to the extent possible so that they don&#39;t misunderstand informational issues as being computational nor vice-versa.

\u00a0No, certainly not - this wasn&#39;t the way I learned things originally, and this isn&#39;t how things are taught in most other schools (at least not yet). \u00a0That&#39;s a pretty weak criteria though - as a student, I distinctly remember wondering to myself why in the world I was learning the things that I was (especially in my intro circuits class, but even well after that), and I perservered despite that.</div><div><br /></div><div>This leads to one of the main reasons I would however argue that including linear algebra in an intro EE(CS) class is absolutely important - and perhaps even almost necessary. \u00a0Including linear algebra allows us to show with relatively little prior background just how powerful the tools and techniques that underly modern EE (and CS) really are in enabling real-world applications that students (particularly freshman) will not only recognize, but have a visceral feeling about/interest in. \u00a0I really can&#39;t take the credit for that particular realization BTW - it was really much more the product of Gireeja Ranade&#39;s and Anant&#39;s thinking than my own (at the time) - but having now worked this through (along with the two of them and many others), linear algebra really is the one conceptual area I can think of that finds substantial importance and use across pretty much the entire spectrum of EE endeavors (including the more physicsy side, as you mentioned). \u00a0As already mentioned, it is also something that can be taught to students coming out of high school (of course with appropriate math maturity) while simultaneously exposing them to the application (and hence making them feel &#34;empowered&#34;). \u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>I certainly agree with you that an integrated approach to teaching physics 7B like material would be extremely worthwhile as well. \u00a0Physics 7B itself however requires more math background than what can be expected from incoming freshman, and so this is one of the reasons why we made the choice to partition things the way we did. \u00a0(Another reason for this is that for better or for worse, in general, students entering from high school tend to have less background in or opportunities to learn physics than they do math.)\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>I&#39;m now dipping into a much more highly speculative topic, but to follow up a bit further on your point about an integrated approach to Physics 7B, there have actually been some discussions amongst the faculty about creating a &#34;16C&#34; (naming along with everything else TBD) that could serve as an alternative option for Physics 7B. \u00a0This (currently hypothetical) course would more directly expose students to the applications/motivations for the 7B material, as well as more generally the &#34;physicy&#34; side of EECS. \u00a0This class could then also leverage the linear algebra (as well as of course circuits and basic sensor ideas) from 16A/B. \u00a0In case it wasn&#39;t obvious from how I started this paragraph, it isn&#39;t at all yet clear when or even if this will happen - the discussions are still highly preliminary. \u00a0Based on my experience from 16A/B, standing up a course like this will take (tens of) thousands of hours of work, and so it&#39;s not a task that anyone will be taking on lightly. \u00a0I do believe it&#39;s an exciting possibility however, and am doing what I can to help support this eventually happening (but again, absolutely no guarantees at all at this time).</div><div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gro4nnkuub", "updated": "2017-03-22T07:10:30Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 3/19 - 3/25", "bucket_order": 157, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-22T07:18:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j0kn1fpkd3n38i", "subject": "I guess that Anant&#39;s and my responses crossed each other, but fortunately, (I think :) we emphasized the same fundamental idea (about the importance of linear algebra) while covering some other orthogonal points. \u00a0Just to re-emphasize though, I have no doubt that there are things that can be improved in both 16A and 16B, so I&#39;d like to make the same offer as Anant did. \u00a0If something doesn&#39;t seem to be working in either of those classes, please feel free to email me as well - a huge amount of thinking and work has gone in to these courses, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t still improvements to be made. \u00a0Constructive feedback is hence always highly welcomed.<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gro4nnkuub", "updated": "2017-03-22T07:18:59Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-20T22:53:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j0ipji7eoxd34f", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>OP here. I disagree with the first student response. Breadths make sense because all L&amp;S majors are fundamentally part of a liberal arts school, which stresses a fundamental understanding of a variety of subjects that don&#39;t relate to our traditional technical curriculum. So that requirement makes sense because that&#39;s the fundamental teaching philosophy behind the entire school; this is why breadths reqs. vary between schools. On the other hand, EE 16a is a major requirement, which means it should (in principle) relate to our specific technical curriculum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prof. Sahai: I appreciate your quick response! I&#39;d love to hear your more detailed answer and maybe follow up in person if necessary, but I just want to point out that my post doesn&#39;t come from a point of conceit but rather from a point of relative frustration. That is, I\u00a0agree entirely that professors would have a much more thorough understanding of the fields and understand what is and isn&#39;t useful to teach us, but often times it may be frustrating from a student&#39;s perspective if we&#39;re told to learn something that seems tangential to everything else we learn when we don&#39;t have an understanding of the bigger picture in mind. I especially see this a lot with 16A since there are many CS majors (myself included) who find it frustrating that we have to learn about circuits. Maybe some of your detailed perspectives on this issue may resolve our concerns! Looking forward to hearing your response.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2017-03-20T22:53:29Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-20T21:22:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs", "16a"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Why do L&amp;S CS majors have to take EE16A?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m currently enrolled in this class and I see little use for 2/3 of this class (i.e. anything outside of linear algebra) for a majority of L&amp;S CS majors who will most likely not deal with circuits in their futures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have heard the following opinions on why this is the case and provided a series of counter points to them:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) EE16A and EE 16B prepare students for\u00a0other CS courses, specifically CS 70</p>\n<p>A broad majority of L&amp;S CS majors don&#39;t end up taking EE 16A nor EE 16B before they are able to declare, since it would be useless to most of them if they weren&#39;t able to get into the major. Therefore, since CS 70 is part of our declaration requirement, we anyways end up taking it before EE 16A and EE 16B, which makes it useless. In regards to prepping us for other courses, a majority of CS upper division courses either don&#39;t require any knowledge of circuits or require a knowledge of circuits that runs tangential to the course material. This can be seen from the fact that 16a and 16b are very sparsely, if at all, listed as prerequisites to any CS upper division course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) A basic amount of knowledge of circuits is essential to a proper CS education.</p>\n<p>I disagree with this entirely. There definitely do exist fields within CS for which a knowledge of circuits would be useful but there also exists numerous fields in CS (esp. with industrial application) that require absolutely no knowledge of circuits. And if this is the case, it seems that imposing a requirement that ALL students must know a basic amount of knowledge on circuits\u00a0would be unfair to those who have no need to use it in the future.
