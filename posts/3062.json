(Also, the way 170 teaches simplex is distinctively non-standard\u00a0(i.e. if you Google &#34;simplex&#34; and look at any\u00a0other\u00a0school or resource like Wikipedia, the terminology and details of implementation are all different, since the 170 textbook only presents a high-level overview). Instead, if you want to learn simplex, I would suggest just trying to code up an implementation of simplex by hand.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Looking at past midterms on TBP,\u00a0I would expect 170 students who learned simplex to solve about half to two-thirds of the exam, and 170 students who didn&#39;t learn simplex to solve one-third?

The Black-Scholes option-pricing formula will be derived and studied. Stochastic simulation ideas will be introduced and used to obtain the risk-neutral geometric Brownian motion values for certain types of Asian, barrier, and lookback options. Portfolio optimization problems will be considered both from a mean-variance and from a utility function point of view. Methods for evaluating real options will be presented. The use of mathematical optimization models as a framework for analyzing financial engineering problems will be shown.&#34;</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>", "created": "2017-01-09T18:21:03Z", "subject": "Prereqs for INDENG 221 (Financial Engineering)?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ixqeziluqwavt", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 3062, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654553470077, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 301}
