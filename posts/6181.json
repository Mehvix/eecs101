I&#39;m leaning towards 188/168 or 188/186, but I&#39;ve been hearing a lot from other students that 188 isn&#39;t particularly &#34;useful,&#34; and that the stuff you learn is too introductory/basic to be able to do anything with. Is this true? Any insight into 188 (and 168/186 if possible) would be great.
