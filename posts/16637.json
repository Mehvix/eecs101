Take a peek through this assortment of mirrors, shapes, and colors, and your ordinary surroundings are cast in a light that seems nothing short of extraordinary.</p>\n<p>Shift the lens, just a bit. A whole new spectrum leaps to life as patterns project themselves in mesmerizing constellations. As everything refracts and revolves around us, we reflect on how the world is \u2013 and, more importantly, what it could become.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a part of our line-up, we are welcoming <strong>Alexandr Wang, MIT grad and Scale AI founder</strong> who brought his idea from a small startup to a powerful platform valued at $7bn in just four years. In addition to Alexandr, our line-up includes other speakers and performers who are the pioneers of their respective fields, with more to be added in the coming weeks as we ramp up to our event date.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At TEDxBerkeley 2022, we invite you to bring novel perspectives to light and reimagine the most pressing issues of our time. How can artificial intelligence invert the way we see the world? What happens when we reimagine sustainability? From grassroots activism to equitable health and everything in between, we will explore society\u2019s greatest challenges and shape solutions through new lenses. Just as a kaleidoscope transforms simple beads and mirrors into something beautiful, we will combine each unique perspective into a mosaic of innovative thought.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Join us at TEDxBerkeley on <strong>April 9th, 2022</strong>, an all-day event with TED-style talks featuring performers and speakers from around the world, addressing a diverse range of topics.
