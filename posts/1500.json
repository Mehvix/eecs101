Though it begins at 9am, we&#39;d actually like to have volunteers show up at 8am, and while I know it&#39;s early, you will get to attend commencement (volunteers will be able to attend the majority of the exercises since most tasks take place before and after during the the reception), you will receive *two* special gifts (they&#39;re pretty nice!), and our guest speaker is Diane Greene--founder of VMWare. If you can volunteer, just email me! Thanks so much!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>all the best,</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Christopher</div>\n</div>", "created": "2016-05-13T23:46:04Z", "subject": "Calling for more volunteers for the CS Commencement next Friday, May 20th!", "uid": "halg8jo1i9m2ye"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "io6dh7a1nir3x6", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 1500, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654555229083, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "cs", "cs-intended", "events", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 349}
