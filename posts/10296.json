That is, in EE 16A/B circuits are taught as a set of mathematical rules that you can apply to diagrams. Physics 7B approaches circuits by first covering principles of electricity and then explaining everything in circuit diagrams from a physical perspective. If you take EE 16A/B before taking Physics 7B, and you&#39;ve never been exposed to circuits before, you may find the abstract approach slightly confusing at first. However, if you take Physics 7B first, you will struggle more with actually solving circuit problems because you will have fewer mathematical tools to work with. If you had even a few weeks of circuits in a high school physics class, I think that&#39;s more than enough to feel comfortable with circuits as they&#39;re introduced in EE 16A. Even if you didn&#39;t, I think you should still probably be fine.
