You should probably take a look at the avg. GPAs of those accepted at the programs you want to apply to, and then make a decision. That said, the difference between 3.75 and a 3.8 can probably be outweighed by having solid letter of recs, research experience, and getting your name on a published paper. You can always focus on these, rather than stressing about your GPA. This is simply what I have observed as someone who is starting the 5th years MS program next fall. I do not have the anywhere near the top GPA that so many applicants have, but I was lucky enough to build rapport with my professors. While, this is not the same as applying to PhD programs, which have higher bars, I do know that the rest of your application matters a lot too.
