The competition will be hosted and promoted by CTSP and made possible through funds provided by Facebook.<br /><br />Team proposals will apply data science skills to address a social good problem with public open data. The objective of the Data for Good Competition is to incentivize students from across the UC Berkeley campus to apply their data science skills towards a compelling public policy or social justice issue.<br /><br />The competition is intended to encourage the creation of data tools or analyses of open data. Issues that may be relevant and addressed via this competition include environmental issues, civic engagement (e.g., voting), government accountability, land use (e.g., housing challenges, agriculture), criminal justice, access to health care, etc. CTSP suggests that teams should consider using local or California state data since there may be additional opportunities for access and collaboration with agencies who produce and maintain these datasets.<br /><br />The competition will consist of three phases:<br />-Initial proposal phase when teams work on developing proposals (<strong>Due\u00a0January 28, 2018</strong>)<br />-Seed grant execution phase when selected teams execute on their proposals (<strong>Comes with $800 per team</strong>)<br />-Final competition and presentation of completed projects at an event in April 2018 (<strong>$5000 grand prize; $2000 runner-up</strong>)<br /><br />More information may be found on CTSP&#39;s website (<a href=\"https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-competition/\">https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-competition/</a>) and questions may be directed to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:CTSP&#64;berkeley.edu\">CTSP&#64;berkeley.edu</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tokyo Tech CAMPUS Asia SUMMER SCHOOL 2018 [Applications due January 31]</strong></p>\n<p>Under the CAMPUS Asia Initiative of the governments of Japan, China and South Korea, Tokyo Tech is an active participant in and contributor to the TKT CAMPUS Asia Consortium, a joint education and research program with Tsinghua University and KAIST.

The aim of this competition to nurture next generation robotics engineer and educate general public about state-of-art robotics technologies. The annual competition requests teams who to build ground robots that use shooting mechanisms to battle with other robots, and the performance of the robots are monitored by a specially designed Referee System, converting projectile hits into Health Point deduction of robots. The competition balances technology and entertainment. Many game elements in the competition are similar to video games.</p>\n<p>RoboMaster now has two competition\u00a0tracks targeting different groups of students.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Track 1, the main track, is RoboMaster FPS competition. Its target participants are mainly undergraduate students who can gain basic system design and implementation experience\u00a0from making shooter robots, which benefits their future careers as engineers. To compete in this track, a team of 3-35 members should be organized. And estimated cost for attending the competition is $50,000 USD. Students are encouraged to explore sponsors and school support by themselves to cover the cost.\u00a0Since each year millions of people will watch RoboMaster FPS competition live broadcast and the\u00a0competition organizing committee will help students to promote their teams, potential sponsors can have global brand exposure. The registration process for RoboMaster FPS competition 2018 is finished by this November. To see the RoboMaster2018 promotional video, go to\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ\">https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ</a></p>\n<p>Track 2, RoboMaster Technical Challenge. This track is harder to participate because all robots enter the challenge must be fully autonomous. Correspondingly, the game theme is simplified in order to let autonomous robots maneuver within it. The Challenge in 2018 will be hosted alongside with IEEE International Conference on Robotics &amp; Automation (ICRA) 2018 in Brisbane, Australia. It is called AI Challenge because the goal of this Challenge is to design autonomous shooter\u00a0robots that can team up, make decisions and fight with opponent shooter\u00a0robots. To accomplish this task, strong AI should be planted in robots.\u00a0The Technical Challenge\u00a0aims to stimulate new robotics systems that better combine AI with multiple\u00a0robots. And participants are expected to publish research papers\u00a0about\u00a0their systems used for the Challenge. Team can have 1-10 members. We recommend the\u00a0majority of the team members are graduate students.\u00a0For AI Challenge rulebook downloading, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub\">https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub</a>\u00a0.</p>\n<p>The ICRA 2018 DJI RoboMaster AI Challenge is currently open for registration to university students.

The objective of the Data for Good Competition is to incentivize students from across the UC Berkeley campus to apply their data science skills towards a compelling public policy or social justice issue.<br /><br />The competition is intended to encourage the creation of data tools or analyses of open data. Issues that may be relevant and addressed via this competition include environmental issues, civic engagement (e.g., voting), government accountability, land use (e.g., housing challenges, agriculture), criminal justice, access to health care, etc. CTSP suggests that teams should consider using local or California state data since there may be additional opportunities for access and collaboration with agencies who produce and maintain these datasets.<br /><br />The competition will consist of three phases:<br />-Initial proposal phase when teams work on developing proposals (<strong>Due\u00a0January 28, 2018</strong>)<br />-Seed grant execution phase when selected teams execute on their proposals (<strong>Comes with $800 per team</strong>)<br />-Final competition and presentation of completed projects at an event in April 2018 (<strong>$5000 grand prize; $2000 runner-up</strong>)<br /><br />More information may be found on CTSP&#39;s website (<a href=\"https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-competition/\">https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-competition/</a>) and questions may be directed to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:CTSP&#64;berkeley.edu\">CTSP&#64;berkeley.edu</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tokyo Tech CAMPUS Asia SUMMER SCHOOL 2018 [Applications due January 31]</strong></p>\n<p>Under the CAMPUS Asia Initiative of the governments of Japan, China and South Korea, Tokyo Tech is an active participant in and contributor to the TKT CAMPUS Asia Consortium, a joint education and research program with Tsinghua University and KAIST.

The aim of this competition to nurture next generation robotics engineer and educate general public about state-of-art robotics technologies. The annual competition requests teams who to build ground robots that use shooting mechanisms to battle with other robots, and the performance of the robots are monitored by a specially designed Referee System, converting projectile hits into Health Point deduction of robots. The competition balances technology and entertainment. Many game elements in the competition are similar to video games.</p>\n<p>RoboMaster now has two competition\u00a0tracks targeting different groups of students.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Track 1, the main track, is RoboMaster FPS competition. Its target participants are mainly undergraduate students who can gain basic system design and implementation experience\u00a0from making shooter robots, which benefits their future careers as engineers. To compete in this track, a team of 3-35 members should be organized. And estimated cost for attending the competition is $50,000 USD. Students are encouraged to explore sponsors and school support by themselves to cover the cost.\u00a0Since each year millions of people will watch RoboMaster FPS competition live broadcast and the\u00a0competition organizing committee will help students to promote their teams, potential sponsors can have global brand exposure. The registration process for RoboMaster FPS competition 2018 is finished by this November. To see the RoboMaster2018 promotional video, go to\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ\">https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ</a></p>\n<p>Track 2, RoboMaster Technical Challenge. This track is harder to participate because all robots enter the challenge must be fully autonomous. Correspondingly, the game theme is simplified in order to let autonomous robots maneuver within it. The Challenge in 2018 will be hosted alongside with IEEE International Conference on Robotics &amp; Automation (ICRA) 2018 in Brisbane, Australia. It is called AI Challenge because the goal of this Challenge is to design autonomous shooter\u00a0robots that can team up, make decisions and fight with opponent shooter\u00a0robots. To accomplish this task, strong AI should be planted in robots.\u00a0The Technical Challenge\u00a0aims to stimulate new robotics systems that better combine AI with multiple\u00a0robots. And participants are expected to publish research papers\u00a0about\u00a0their systems used for the Challenge. Team can have 1-10 members. We recommend the\u00a0majority of the team members are graduate students.\u00a0For AI Challenge rulebook downloading, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub\">https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub</a>\u00a0.</p>\n<p>The ICRA 2018 DJI RoboMaster AI Challenge is currently open for registration to university students.

The aim of this competition to nurture next generation robotics engineer and educate general public about state-of-art robotics technologies. The annual competition requests teams who to build ground robots that use shooting mechanisms to battle with other robots, and the performance of the robots are monitored by a specially designed Referee System, converting projectile hits into Health Point deduction of robots. The competition balances technology and entertainment. Many game elements in the competition are similar to video games.</p>\n<p>RoboMaster now has two competition\u00a0tracks targeting different groups of students.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Track 1, the main track, is RoboMaster FPS competition. Its target participants are mainly undergraduate students who can gain basic system design and implementation experience\u00a0from making shooter robots, which benefits their future careers as engineers. To compete in this track, a team of 3-35 members should be organized. And estimated cost for attending the competition is $50,000 USD. Students are encouraged to explore sponsors and school support by themselves to cover the cost.\u00a0Since each year millions of people will watch RoboMaster FPS competition live broadcast and the\u00a0competition organizing committee will help students to promote their teams, potential sponsors can have global brand exposure. The registration process for RoboMaster FPS competition 2018 is finished by this November. To see the RoboMaster2018 promotional video, go to\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ\">https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ</a></p>\n<p>Track 2, RoboMaster Technical Challenge. This track is harder to participate because all robots enter the challenge must be fully autonomous. Correspondingly, the game theme is simplified in order to let autonomous robots maneuver within it. The Challenge in 2018 will be hosted alongside with IEEE International Conference on Robotics &amp; Automation (ICRA) 2018 in Brisbane, Australia. It is called AI Challenge because the goal of this Challenge is to design autonomous shooter\u00a0robots that can team up, make decisions and fight with opponent shooter\u00a0robots. To accomplish this task, strong AI should be planted in robots.\u00a0The Technical Challenge\u00a0aims to stimulate new robotics systems that better combine AI with multiple\u00a0robots. And participants are expected to publish research papers\u00a0about\u00a0their systems used for the Challenge. Team can have 1-10 members. We recommend the\u00a0majority of the team members are graduate students.\u00a0For AI Challenge rulebook downloading, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub\">https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub</a>\u00a0.</p>\n<p>The ICRA 2018 DJI RoboMaster AI Challenge is currently open for registration to university students.

The aim of this competition to nurture next generation robotics engineer and educate general public about state-of-art robotics technologies. The annual competition requests teams who to build ground robots that use shooting mechanisms to battle with other robots, and the performance of the robots are monitored by a specially designed Referee System, converting projectile hits into Health Point deduction of robots. The competition balances technology and entertainment. Many game elements in the competition are similar to video games.</p>\n<p>RoboMaster now has two competition\u00a0tracks targeting different groups of students.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Track 1, the main track, is RoboMaster FPS competition. Its target participants are mainly undergraduate students who can gain basic system design and implementation experience\u00a0from making shooter robots, which benefits their future careers as engineers. To compete in this track, a team of 3-35 members should be organized. And estimated cost for attending the competition is $50,000 USD. Students are encouraged to explore sponsors and school support by themselves to cover the cost.\u00a0Since each year millions of people will watch RoboMaster FPS competition live broadcast and the\u00a0competition organizing committee will help students to promote their teams, potential sponsors can have global brand exposure. The registration process for RoboMaster FPS competition 2018 is finished by this November. To see the RoboMaster2018 promotional video, go to\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ\">https://youtu.be/uI2uoV58pzQ</a></p>\n<p>Track 2, RoboMaster Technical Challenge. This track is harder to participate because all robots enter the challenge must be fully autonomous. Correspondingly, the game theme is simplified in order to let autonomous robots maneuver within it. The Challenge in 2018 will be hosted alongside with IEEE International Conference on Robotics &amp; Automation (ICRA) 2018 in Brisbane, Australia. It is called AI Challenge because the goal of this Challenge is to design autonomous shooter\u00a0robots that can team up, make decisions and fight with opponent shooter\u00a0robots. To accomplish this task, strong AI should be planted in robots.\u00a0The Technical Challenge\u00a0aims to stimulate new robotics systems that better combine AI with multiple\u00a0robots. And participants are expected to publish research papers\u00a0about\u00a0their systems used for the Challenge. Team can have 1-10 members. We recommend the\u00a0majority of the team members are graduate students.\u00a0For AI Challenge rulebook downloading, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub\">https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/728?type=announcementSub</a>\u00a0.</p>\n<p>The ICRA 2018 DJI RoboMaster AI Challenge is currently open for registration to university students.
