Javascript knowledge (jsNode is ok) will come in handy, as it will give you an understanding of what listeners are, something that happens to be very recurrent in mobile app dev and that is hard to grasp (initially) if you&#39;ve never coded using listeners before. I cannot talk about Swift, but the transition from 61A into Android Mobile App Development was pretty reasonable for me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I had never done real object oriented programming before. This was probably the main obstacle for me when I started to code on Java, but was something that I picked up in the way in a quick time due to what I had already learned about object oriented programming in 61A. With 61B under your wing, the change will be far less drastic (just syntax, listeners, and intents). The skills are easy to pick up and you will find yourself coding stuff in a small amount of time. My recommendation is bouncing into video tutorials, documentation, and Stack Overflow when in doubt. Except for a couple of things that are not carried on into Mobile Dev and activities and fragments, it will be very similar to Java (in the sense that most of what you will be coding will be object oriented). These &#34;mobile app dev skills&#34; can be easily picked up following a series of video tutorials on Coursera, Udacity, or with Google (they have many video tutorials explaining the fundamentals of Mobile App Dev for Android).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I were you, I&#39;d go with Android Dev rather than with iOS dev. Android Dev will happen more naturally, because you already know Java. Android also has by far many more users. This might not seem obvious to you if you are from California, but in most countries around the world, Android is by far more common than iOS. Also, learning to do app dev in Android will be a skill that will be more useful to you in Software Engineering or Mobile App Dev in general than Swift, and will make you employable in more places. This if you are looking at this long term. If you are looking at this short term, you should focus on improving your current skills rather than trying to do everything, which is why I would still recommend you to do Android Dev over iOS dev, at least for now</p>", "created": "2018-03-08T06:43:31Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4"}], "id": "jei5btdo8af6sh", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irbs8zu62fo155", "name": "Kate Tan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz4uczhrpbq164", "name": "Woo Sik (Lewis) Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "je7njk26iqd1k9", "name": "Marcus Chan", "photo": "1519857235_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/je7njk26iqd1k9/1519857235_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3us5y1yjh5h4", "name": "Jiayi Chen", "photo": "1549264530_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j3us5y1yjh5h4/1549264530_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["irbs8zu62fo155", "hz4uczhrpbq164", "je7njk26iqd1k9", "j3us5y1yjh5h4"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/4 - 3/10", "bucket_order": 109, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 3/4 - 3/10", "bucket_order": 109, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-08T08:24:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jei8xj0lezk2c6", "subject": "<p>This is straight up obvious.
