CS70 should have given you enough of that type of mathematical maturity. What might be a concern is that you said you took &#34;up to Math 54 in high school&#34;. If the rigor of your high school math classes wasn&#39;t comparable to Berkeley, or it was so long ago that you&#39;ve forgotten a lot, you might struggle a bit with certain things. In my case, the only &#34;math&#34; class I had taken at Berkeley was CS70, and all the math classes I had taken elsewhere were a joke. I still managed to do well in 113, but I had to get a lot of help to make up for my weak math background. Often it wasn&#39;t that the material required it, exactly, but that the homework problems were written under the assumption that I had learned and remembered everything from 1a, 1b, and 54. But if your background isn&#39;t an issue, or you&#39;re willing to put in a bit more work than someone who took those classes at Berkeley, you should be perfectly fine.</p>", "created": "2018-10-13T02:30:10Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>There is little overlap between Math 113 and Math 110; the only overlap I can remember were the vector spaces in relation to fields, which is covered in the very end of 113, but I think that the material from 54 is enough to understand that part of the course.
