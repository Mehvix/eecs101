Even on a normal schedule in the semester, homeworks vary between 8~10 hours (they cut down the homework slightly this semester) and but some homework can take 12-14 hours. Some of my friend who have straight A&#39;s in 61 series, 70, 170 all either struggle and do bad in 16B or just do well but say its the hardest class they&#39;ve ever taken in terms of the sheer number of hours spent into the class to do well.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don&#39;t forget you also have lab.
