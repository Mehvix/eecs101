I also had credit for 61B and discrete math, but took 61B and 70 last year (not together though) which was a great decision because I learned so much more! So even though I took discrete math, 70 was much harder, not really because of the concepts, but just the homework assignments and exams. They take up most of the week, unless you are exceptionally smart or have a great group. Now, 61B is pretty\u00a0easy and fun if you already took Data Structures/Java courses, but the projects and assignments also take up a good amount of time. So the combo of 61B and 70 shouldn&#39;t be bad conceptually, but you will just have a good amount of &#34;work&#34;. As for 184, I haven&#39;t taken it so I&#39;m not sure, but with these 3 techs, I would say it is doable, but it might be hard to get all A&#39;s (it is possible though), and you will have some rough weeks. But, hey, that&#39;s what Berkeley is all about! I also recommend not taking any other courses for a letter grade (i.e., if you need to take breadth courses), unless the average grade distribution is like an A- or something.
