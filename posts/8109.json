Watching all my freshman floor mates hanging out on a Wednesday night and I was like \u201cdon\u2019t y\u2019all have homework to do? I have so much!\u201d. Spring semester freshman year I only had like one conversation a week with someone that wasn\u2019t about the courses or the extracurriculars I was in. At the time, it didn\u2019t bother me that much because I was so focused on getting things done. But this past summer I some pretty amazing social interactions and I realized that I really needed some more social time (for my sanity but also growth as a person) so that was my goal this semester. Now I hang out with friends a bit more often, and make it a priority to say yes to some things/events that I wouldn\u2019t have gone too last year. I still probably hang out with friends than some people (most of my non-study friend hangouts are Friday and Saturday nights), but its getting better</li><li><ol><li>One tip I discovered this year was studying with people - we don\u2019t actually work on the same assignments, but even just sitting with people and taking 5 minute breaks every hour to chat about random stuff goes a long way in cultivating your social health.\u00a0</li><li><ol><li>Sometimes you can be a little less productive so you also have to know when you need to sequester yourself in the library to get stuff done.\u00a0</li></ol></li></ol>\n</li><li>Sleep also used to be a big priority (I used to go to bed even earlier), but as I\u2019ve made time for more social events, I have lost about an hour of sleep I used to get. I can manage it most of the time, but I\u2019ve also learned to say no to extra events or hangouts when I\u2019ve had a week of bad sleep because bad sleep is singlehandedly the worst thing to get me off track - a lack of sleep makes the world seem so much more depressing and awful.\u00a0</li><li>I don\u2019t have a set hour a day to go to the RSF and work out, so I make sure I get my blood pumping by walking to class everyone(I have a long walk up a hill) (I only take the bus if its pouring rain) and taking a lot stairs on campus. You do what you Gotta do.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>How do I stay on top of the work?</p>\n<ol><li>I spend a lot of times in office hours and piazza. I have a lot of questions when first encountering material and identifying what I don\u2019t understand, and asking questions till I understand every intricacy goes a long way in helping me understand the material.\u00a0</li><li>Keeping up with lectures - I go to most of my lectures, and sometimes I\u2019m like \u201cwhy am I spending an hour and a half in this room I could be doing so much more\u201d but whenever I don\u2019t go to lecture I never end up watching the video which is worst. So don\u2019t fall behind.\u00a0</li><li>figure out what supplemental material you need to help you learn the subject. I like to read textbooks in addition to lectures (bc most of them are written well) but other people prefer Khan academy videos and the like.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>How do I deal with Stress?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a very anxious person, and I\u2019ve gone through many stages of handling stress in the past two years. Freshman spring semester, I actually began having panic attacks from the stress of trying to finish all of my assignments and get good grades. I ended up seeing a therapist for that semester, who gave me some great coping strategies (side note: don\u2019t hesitate to reach out about mental health - the Tang center offers services. There\u2019s no shame in getting therapy). I also had a lot of stress because coming from high school, I had tied a lot of my self worth into my grades. Berkeley STEM classes were hard, and it was devastating to me to do bad on exams. But after two years of getting sometimes bad exams scores and still ending up ok, I\u2019ve learned to let myself be sad for a bit after a bad score and then I move on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Case in point: I got less than 40% (raw) on a final in the spring. When I got the score back, I ugly cried for about 30 minutes, and then I went to a concert and moved on. I still ended up with a B&#43; in the course! Curves are your friend lol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some things that help me:\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you have a lot of commitment , if you think about everything you have to do in the next few weeks its very easy to panic and be overwhelmed. I\u2019ve found that if I only focus on a week at a time, or even a day at a time, I can prevent the paralyzing panic of \u201co my god o my god o my god\u201d. What is due first? Let me do that assignment. What is next? And so on.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This semester, which is the most workload I\u2019ve ever had, I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of channeling my nervous energy into adrenaline and focus for assignments - like \u201cI don\u2019t have time for a breakdown right now I\u2019ve got shit to do\u201d. So like the nervousness is channeled into motivation to get stuff done. This is NOT a healthy long term coping mechanism. The repression of anxiety will build up and spill out every few weeks. And then you have a small breakdown. When that happens, its important to either 1) take some time for yourself - forget about your assignments for a couple hours, take a walk, read a book or 2) find a good friend and talk to them about it, so that they can be like \u201cits gonna be ok\u201d while they listen to you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also ok to let it out in a good cry once in a while - its therapeutic and healthy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fact, I write this right after a small breakdown myself - I have a midterm tomorrow and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have gone out twice this weekend, because now Im unmotivated and tired and pretty stressed and not sure how I\u2019m going to pull it together, but I also know that if I had spent another weekend of pure studying and no interaction ( like I did last weekend) I would go insane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also good to talk about it! People don\u2019t talk about their stress enough here at Cal, and it really helps. This post was actually somewhat therapeutic. Find some friends that you can let a little steam off with (don\u2019t dump it all onto one friend though - its too much for both of you. ).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, you find yo</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2018-10-28T21:14:08Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/28 - 11/3", "bucket_order": 86, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-28T22:23:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jntfxd4f8t61rp", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Student Answer, that was a really great response :)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6unggda5ox", "updated": "2018-10-28T22:23:01Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/28 - 11/3", "bucket_order": 86, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/28 - 11/3", "bucket_order": 86, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-11-03T00:59:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jo0qq5nb5vgzw", "subject": "<p>Since you know how to study and get good grades, any tips?

So during dead week, I took 3-4 practice tests. And most importantly, not only did I take the practice tests, and like force myself to spend at least 10 minutes on every problem (even if I was stuck), I also thoroughly corrected the tests. For every answer I got wrong, I made sure I understood what logical mistake led me to the incorrect answer, and I understood why the solution was correct. For every problem I got stuck on and left blank, I made sure I understood why the official solution worked, and I tried to find\u00a0<em>what line of reasoning would have gotten me unstuck during an exam.\u00a0</em>For example, I might have been trying to prove the forward implication of a statement and got stuck, when I actually should have realized that the contrapositive was much easier to prove and gone down that direction. And if I didn&#39;t understand the official solution (which was quite often because they weren&#39;t written the best), I sat in office hours and bugged the TA&#39;s until I understood.

Extra curriculars including TAing, csm, reading, running, and hanging out with friends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>b. Whats your daily routine?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wake up, either grab clothes I prepped from night before, or find some clean clothes, but em on, do the morning hygene stuff. Head to class or someplace to do work. I don&#39;t eat breakfast, but usually I eat lunch between 11-2pm, and by then I&#39;d like to have some work done. I have classes/club stuff throughout the day until 8, and then I am free to go eat dinner and hang out with friends/do work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Throughout the day I either go to lecture, or skip it if its webcasted and I want to hang out with friends instead/go to something else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I usually do homework last minute, which is a bad habit, but it&#39;s worked for me so far. I run on the weekends, and sleep in. I think I spend too much time with friends lol.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>c. What do you sacrifice(not do) in order to succeed and/or survive with a busy schedule?</p>\n<p>Deep understanding of materials. I know how to study and so I get good grades, but I don&#39;t put as much effort into each class as I would if I had a lot more time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t exercise as much as I want to. I don&#39;t have as much free time for extra learning/courses like I did in high school. Some days I get pretty tired by the end of the day and just play on my phone mindlessly which I don&#39;t like about myself. I don&#39;t eat breakfast.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sometimes I procrastinate so much that I have homeworks/projects due the next day and I work late into the night. Never all nighters tho, and never multiple late night days in a row.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>d. How stressful does it get? Normally people at Berkeley don&#39;t talk about how stressed they are, so it&#39;d be nice to get a real perspective.</p>\n<p>Honestly I don&#39;t really get stressed. I know i&#39;ll do fine in my classes, and if not, it&#39;s chill.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>e. What tips do you have to balance so much work? Work in study groups? Live in office hours? No more hangouts with friends?</p>\n<p>Preview the material beforehand if you can. This helped me a lot in 61a/math 54. Study groups aren&#39;t super helpful for me, but slc/office hours are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>f. Do you have time to relax and do nothing/watch netflix?</p>\n<p>Yes definitely.
