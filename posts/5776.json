Can we mathematically represent how similar two different consumers are? How are integer linear programs actually solved? This course is designed to introduce students of all majors to a theoretical foundation for applying machine learning to business decisions. Specifically, our course is geared toward effectively evaluating decisions to maximize profit in a way that is not currently taught in the computer science, business administration, nor economics departments.</p>\n<p>Sign up here:\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HkA4nCpGuwsGR-LgSaYVO9Hk_9TjzEWHe6pDNuC4JNw/\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HkA4nCpGuwsGR-LgSaYVO9Hk_9TjzEWHe6pDNuC4JNw/</a></p>\n<p>Please contact Neel Somani (<a href=\"mailto:neel&#64;berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\">neel&#64;berkeley.edu</a>) or Jason Bao (<a href=\"mailto:jzbao&#64;berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\">jzbao&#64;berkeley.edu</a>) if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Uberversity Career Prep Program</p>\n<p>Uber is still taking applications for the Uberversity Career Prep Program with The Hidden Genius Project.
