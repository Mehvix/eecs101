But the three in combination would be hard to handle even if you generally outperform your peers just because you are being tested on the two extremes (math and systems) at the same time plus 161 is kind of it&#39;s own thing (so there will be a very small overlap between 161, 162 and 170) and there&#39;s also a bunch of work, especially for 162 and 170</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2019-12-12T17:54:06Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-12-11T17:59:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k41lm62noyk5e1", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Hi OP, I didn&#39;t do that well on 70 or 61c and I still managed to do well in 161.

To be honest with you, I don&#39;t feel cs186 gave me something useful for industry as a software developer (unless, of course, you plant to work as core database developer at Oracle, Microsoft, etc) It is good in the sense that you learn about the tradeoffs and you can think a bit better on how to design schemas and how to write efficient queries having in mind how the guts of a DB works.
