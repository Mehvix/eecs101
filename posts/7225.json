It is useful in\u00a0<strong>every</strong> branch of Computer Science and it helps you develop mathematical maturity and, in my honest opinion, an unparalleled level of problem solving skills.

Just presenting a positive if you did.\n\nYou need 0 internships to get your dream job. Getting 1 internship is all you need to learn how daily Software Engineering works and to gain practical work experience before you Full Time. Getting more than 1 will absolutely benefit in terms of meeting people, but it&#39;s highly unlikely you&#39;ll learn just as much, unless you &#34;upgraded&#34;. The idea behind the internship is, for those who have free time in the summer between school years, can gain experience to prepare them for full time work. I think people mistake internships as an entry requirement for work. It&#39;s not, just understand that companies want to minimize revamp time, so internships on resumes give recruiters confidence you can work on projects quicker.\n\nUpgraded = 1st internship you didn&#39;t do, learn, meet people, much. I see a lot of sophomores and freshman take internships at small companies and have mediocre experiences, according to them. Then end of Junior year they get an internship at a medium sized place and learn a ton.\n\nRevamp = time it takes to get a new hire ready to get rolling with work.\n\nI personally have only interned once, for a big company, and believe i&#39;m prepared to work in the industry now. I&#39;ve met enough people, asked a lot of questions, and was blessed to be assigned awesome work, so I am ready to go into any environment, learn the technology, and begin working.\n\nI have mad respect for people with the courage to persevere through school and challenge themselves by coming to a rigorous institution like Cal.
