However, has anyone taken 126 and 189 concurrently and if so what was their experience like? Did 126 help out with 189 as the semester progressed? I saw a post saying doing them concurrently makes 189 harder but I&#39;m not too sure how. I also want to take 126 not because it will just help out with 189 (potentially), but also because I&#39;m interested in the content and want to do the class regardless. Thus would 126 and 189 concurrently be a good idea? (Assuming the rest of my semester is light).
