Chill course to see an overview of all artificial intelligence and light introduction to Bayes nets, RL, and Neural networks. Also if Prof. Anca Dragan is teaching it, it is a really fun class. (my experience)\n\n170 is more time consuming with a weekly PS (optional, but you should really take them), a fairly difficult exam (here, curve will definitely save you) and a final project. Essential course for a lot of leetcode and SWE interview questions and for algorithms in general. You most likely will eventually have to take it to learn dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and some optimization basics.</md>", "created": "2021-04-27T01:59:22Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "knzdsmthdle5so", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "name": "Anusha Subramanian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-27T04:01:18Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "knzi5fejkocga", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thanks Nicholas!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvg5rtq4e4uz"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-04-27T04:01:18Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11584": 2, "11911": 1, "1238": 6, "12584": 3, "14707": 8, "496": 9, "7099": 4, "7327": 5, "7769": 7, "8921": 0}}, "created": "2021-04-27T00:29:14Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m taking EECS 151 in the fall but I don&#39;t know what other technical to take with it.
