Within that, we will probably prioritized undeclared intended-CS freshmen (to help align them into the new system), but there aren&#39;t that many of them signed up. So other people are definitely going to get in from the waitlist. Beyond the waitlist, there will be some natural attrition as people drop the course ahead of the drop deadline for random reasons --- probably another 25 seats at least will free up if 5% drop. So, another set of persistent people will be able to get off of the waitlist and into the course. But not everyone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We&#39;d love to be able to get everyone in, but we don&#39;t have the lab space, hw party space, or teaching resources.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Currently, my advice to folks who have a specifically &#34;EE&#34; requirement that needs to be filled like MechE or BioE or so on is to take EE40 the last time it is offered. That is a traditional EE course of the type that serves MechE students well. They should not really be in the 16A waitlist. 16A is not currently designed to, by itself, serve the needs of those students. It is designed to be an introductory EECS course that will, together with 16B, serve the needs of EECS and L&amp;S CS students primarily. \u00a0These folks should drop off the waitlist for sure and register for 40.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For experienced L&amp;S CS students who are already taking upper-division EECS courses and really just want to take one course and graduate --- if you are viewing 16A as a breadth course, you&#39;re probably better off just taking 20 or 40 since it is the last time those are being offered. 16A isn&#39;t intended to be approached as a breadth course for anyone. If you just want to be able to take 105 or 130 or 140 or 142, taking 40 is probably the better option. \u00a016AB are going to be run and taught and graded assuming that the core set of students\u00a0are freshmen --- the way that 61AB are. 40 and 20 are more sophomore-aimed courses, the way 61C and 70 are.</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2015-07-31T19:11:13Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-07-31T18:30:41Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "icryu59763q6ue", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What about undeclared CS students who used their phase 1 units (and positioned in the top 25% of the waitlist? based on the current waitlist size of 237)?
