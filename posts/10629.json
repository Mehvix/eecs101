A lot of people took it that way and then dropped because over the summer you have a late drop that is independent of the late drop you get for the semesters (about 1/6 ish of my class dropped late before the final). The thing about the class is that they attempt to teach you A LOT and over the summer this is done in 2x the speed, so you\u00a0have less time in general to just soak in the material. I took it with an R&amp;C course and I felt really burned out by the end.\u00a0I think if you\u00a0<em>only</em> took 70 over the summer, and literally nothing else/didn&#39;t work, etc., you&#39;d probably find it easier. But it may just be easier to take\u00a070 in the spring with two other non-crucial classes.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-10-30T00:48:48Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>My recommendation is for you to take CS 70 in the Spring.
