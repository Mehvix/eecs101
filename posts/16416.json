I'm Addison, a 61A TA who's taught for several semesters now. This semester, Sean O'Brien (61A+70+189 TA) and I are teaching a new DeCal called \"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\", with the following description:\n\n> This DeCal is an adaptation of MIT's mini lecture series by the same name. From their course description:\n> \n> Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there\u2019s one critical subject that\u2019s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We\u2019ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!\n> \n> Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.\n> \n> This class is intended for students who\n> * have taken at least one introductory CS course (eg. CS61A, Data 8, Engineering E7, etc.)\n> * are going into a programming-heavy field\n> \n> No prerequisites will be strictly enforced, but we will prioritize students with introductory programming knowledge should we exceed enrollment capacity. (We will not be sorting students on further knowledge.)\n> \n> There will be ~1.5 hours of lectures+labs per week + 2 hours of homework + reading. Attendance is not mandatory but is highly recommended.\n\nIf you would like to sign up, please fill out https://links.cs198.org/interest. Our website is https://cs198.org/. Thanks!\n\n(Feel free to PM me if you have any Qs! That's probably the best way to get a fast reply :D)</md>", "created": "2022-01-17T21:49:14Z", "subject": "[DeCal] The Missing Semester of Your CS Education", "uid": "j3nrz7ofb1a4kl"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kyj7zjn61051g9", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 16416, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538938736, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh1mrzsmq35q", "name": "Massimiliano de Sa", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1634974210, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1594950095, "ksxpylctdzq66": 1634974002}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaamqk4tvrk5lg", "name": "Eric Che", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyeqkpt0e8023s", "name": "Lucy Wan", "photo": "1599950541_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jyeqkpt0e8023s/1599950541_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1581210147, "jziyku5gomy7aq": 1576285183, "k0g9j3r04edcn": 1575391697, "k5eevxebzpj25b": 1579570570, "k5g56y7yegw5xr": 1581284108, "k5mvapjoenll2": 1586565748, "k5qacftvzwp155": 1585607475, "kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1603637279, "ke609ylh5ap5uv": 1603222682}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jy1rz92rpon1wh", "name": "Akshit Dewan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1535223700, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1525795138, "j5zp8esecm31rr": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1515461097, "j9j0udrxjjp758": 1519242790, "jjd5ukm1ddp6x6": 1535223700, "jkopvsyuy7g3u0": 1535681645}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j1hge0e6rt9yo", "name": "Alex Kassil", "photo": "1525041329_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j1hge0e6rt9yo/1525041329_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzdh1mrzsmq35q", "jktvex6279x3zb", "kaamqk4tvrk5lg", "jyeqkpt0e8023s", "jy1rz92rpon1wh", "j1hge0e6rt9yo"], "tags": ["announcements", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 415}
