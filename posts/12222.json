Also, taking summer classes will usually make your schedule less packed in the long run.<br /><br />CS162 over summer is hell. The projects are already almost back-to-back in normal course offerings, so they&#39;re even more accelerated during the summer. I&#39;ve had two friends do that and it wasn&#39;t great for them. You will likely not be able to do much with your upper elective if you take it in the summer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My impression is that Option 1 is avoiding any of the classes with higher workload. I think you shouldn&#39;t avoid classes with a reputation of being hard, but plan your schedule around them. I don&#39;t think you should take option 2; CS162 over the summer as hell as I said, and CS164 can be tough; it would be better to take that as the sole technical rather than with 168. I think option 3 is the most balanced option, since CS161 is not as high of a workload as CS162, and you take CS164 as the sole technical. Spring semester might be tough, though.</p>\n<p><br />Besides that, do whatever you think is best for your situation and education goals.
