The priority would definitely help. You probably don&#39;t need to double major, unless you want to work on the very mathematical\u00a0side of research. I don&#39;t have much experience in robotics research, but I think the extent to which math upper divs would be useful to you is a function of how mathematical you want your research to be. Most papers in AI currently do not contain much math beyond basic linear algebra. However, there are also lots of Berkeley PhD students and professors who utilize more advanced mathematical methods to study the dynamics of neural nets and optimization.

And I had taken 126 for 3 weeks(did all HWs) and feel comfortable with the content. The dilemma is,\u00a0should I take it next semester? If so it might more like &#34;practicing&#34; instead of &#34;learning&#34; given previous effort on probabilities. If not, will I be disadvantaged in applying for research?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q2: Should I double major in math? I am thinking about it because advanced math seems fundamental in research. However, it seems that EECS department has already offered math courses like EECS126 and 127, and I can either choose a few courses like MATH104 as a CS student or dive myself into math major. I know Robotics&amp;AI requires extensive math but is not sure if the math courses in math major requirements are useful for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q3: Are grad courses hard to enroll in? From the syllabus of them, I can see they are critical to research but I heard that these course are often over enrolled and it is hard for undergrad to get in.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q4: [For Prof Sahai if you are looking at it], CS189 changed its syllabus this semester and removed several topics like MLE/MAP derivation of minimization objective. I personally followed notes in Sp2018 and tried some of its HW about these missing topics. However, my friend told me that a lot of contents are not in those notes. Where can I self-study those removed materials? Will I miss anything if I just read the notes?</p>", "created": "2018-09-26T18:16:26Z", "subject": "Classes for AI/Robotics advice?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jmjh107myxm4tn", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7654, "num_favorites": 3, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548582515, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"global": 1, "imm91o6q8qv5hg": 1, "is758hjb2yo2sy": 1, "ixwkta02en780": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy7g0roh1q3", "name": "Aditya Baradwaj", "photo": "1455863575_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/icguy7g0roh1q3/1455863575_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy0rwhu91l6", "name": "Jae Sung Park", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["icguy7g0roh1q3", "icguy0rwhu91l6"], "tags": ["eecs", "enrollments", "faculty_advising", "lscs", "other", "research", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 863}
