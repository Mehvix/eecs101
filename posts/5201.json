Mathematical maturity in this context meaning, having taken EE16A/EE16B, and one of Math53/54(assuming you haven&#39;t takenEE16A).\n\nHaving said that, I decided to replace CS70 with CS61C, and so I plan on having the following schedule:\n- Math 53\n- CS61 C\n- EE16B\n- R1B\n\nWhat does everyone think of this new schedule?
