While Math110 covers some similar topics as Math 54 (and then some different stuff at the end) - there is almost no computation. Instead of calculating an inverse, you prove something about an inverse. And in my experience, the homeworks I had in 110 did a phenomenal job of &#34;building&#34; your proof writing abilities - starting with small, manageable proofs and then building up to something larger, which really gets you comfortable writing proofs (of any kind - this is helping me in math104 at the moment). In contrast, my experience with 70 proofs is just being tossed into the deep end with less good effect.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TBH if you have the space, I think both Math110 and EE127 would be valuable. Math110 will give you strong linear algebra and math writing intuition, and then 127 is a great course to see how you can use your linear algebra intuition to apply to optimization/machine learning contexts. If I&#39;d had to choose one though, I would say 110. 127 without a strong foundational knowledge would mean some of the cool nuances would be lost simply trying to keep up with the material.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is9ein4lpno52m", "updated": "2019-10-01T13:32:37Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-01T02:35:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "peer_directed", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am a graduating senior and planning schedule for my final semester.\u00a0I am debating whether to take MATH 110 to strengthen linear algebra or not.
