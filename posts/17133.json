I have not taken 61C, but I&#39;ve been learning/reviewing the 61C material before 162 starts. This is because of the new policies \u2014 I won&#39;t be able to take 162 in Fall as a CS minor, so I can only take it over the summer, before 61C. But I&#39;ve received As in all previous coursework and I always work really hard on projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll be between SF and Berkeley over the summer so I can definitely do in-person or online meetings as well.
