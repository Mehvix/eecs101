I took it Summer 2018, with Nick and Steven. It covers a lot of material and many different topics, so it felt more like a bio class than a quantitative reasoning class, but it was still quite fun. Just make sure to really go through lecture slides; the details do matter. It is also really fast paced, so you might feel overwhelmed at first. Also class meets everyday so it might be hard to digest material. I think discussion attendance is not mandatory. The projects were all solo projects, but they usually took one weekend to do. Exams were really hard; I blanked on several questions during the final, but everyone found it difficult so it curved well. I would recommend starting on projects early, and try to finish labs in class and not fall behind in lecture. But if it\u2019s your only class, as long as you put in the work you\u2019ll be fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>for reference, I took it with Math 185.
