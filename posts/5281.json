It&#39;s just the fact that 137A is an intro course so we only end up doing 4 chapters of griffith where the first chapter shouldn&#39;t even be counted. You will see probability and linear algebra but they are nothing new.

The class is obviously not always intuitive and since the most models are too complex to solve using schrodingers eq, many crude approximations are made to solve very limited number of models such as particle in a box, harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would advise against taking a graduate physics course if you haven&#39;t taken any upper div physics courses unless you know what you are doing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-10-19T19:39:57Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/15 - 10/21", "bucket_order": 128, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-10-19T23:44:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j8z44zky2tc43q", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I personally don&#39;t really see a reason to take extra physics classes when there are so many upper div math/ EE courses that are more relevant to what you will be doing in ML/AI, but that&#39;s just my opinion.
