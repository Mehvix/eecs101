Last time I checked (correct me if I&#39;m wrong, these requirements keep on changing), you just need to take two out of the following: Math 54, EE 16a, and EE16b. Almost all of math 54 material is covered in the 16 series, with the exception of cofactor expansion and maybe some other small topic. CS 189 (Machine Learning) and other upper division classes have also been restructured based on the changes in the 16 series. Especially if you have any interest in Machine Learning or AI, you should definitely take 16a and 16b. EE16b actually goes into important material not covered in 54 that is really important to said topics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Source: I&#39;m a 16a TA</p>", "created": "2018-01-13T03:42:01Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jcct2elumvxrb", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": true, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2018_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2017_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2016_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "transfers_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "testgroup_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "instr_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "1002953403", "id": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "name": "Anant Sahai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "instructor", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j52tuayf2uf7om", "name": "Dev Ojha", "photo": "1504021332_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j52tuayf2uf7om/1504021332_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["gxj8rtteeuaa9", "j52tuayf2uf7om"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-13T01:42:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>for CS students planning on taking 16a and math 54: does it matter which one you take first?</p>", "created": "2018-01-13T01:42:59Z", "subject": "ee 16a vs. math 54", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jccotbxh3hl2dn", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6003, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550406189, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["lscs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 298}
