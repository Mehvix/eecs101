But here is my experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I accepted my summer internship, I was told that there was a good chance that they would want to keep me on part-time for the fall. And they did. If I had done this, I probably would have petitioned for a reduced course load (I have another PT job during the semester, so I would have been working 40 hours a week) and just taken a couple low-workload classes. I believe you don&#39;t pay as much tuition in this case. Other friends of mine\u00a0who had fall internships had 6-month ones, so instead of being a standalone internship, they were more extensions of summer ones. So if you&#39;re still looking for a summer internship as well, then keep an eye out for the longer ones/ask about the possibility during your interviews.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve taken a semester off, and it wasn&#39;t a difficult process. So I&#39;m sure\u00a0taking off\u00a0one semester is fine as long as you&#39;re in good academic standing. But if you&#39;d like to take a class or two while working, and your job is close enough to Berkeley,\u00a0then get a reduced courseload. I found that it was a bit hard to get back into the swing of things (i.e. working all day every day) once I returned to Berkeley, so keep that in mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some links (not sure if you are EECS or LSCS):</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.berkeley.edu/reduced-course-load\">https://engineering.berkeley.edu/reduced-course-load</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/enrolling/course-load-limits\">https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/enrolling/course-load-limits</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/withdrawal\">https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/withdrawal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/academic-progress/changing-status/withdrawal\">https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/academic-progress/changing-status/withdrawal</a></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-12-17T21:20:25Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-12-17T21:53:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I have done an off cycle internship before.

How does the process work when you do get a job during the school year? Would you have to &#34;withdraw&#34; for that semester, or is there a slightly different process so that you can get units while having the job? Will I have to pay any fees, or will I just pay essentially like half tuition for (as an example) when I return to Berkeley in the spring after a fall internship?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2.
