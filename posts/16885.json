Join us on Saturday, April 23rd in Jacobs Hall for FemTech&#39;s Spring 2022 Hackathon: FEMHacks 2.0!</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">FEMHacks is our annual Hackathon for female, non-binary, and gender minority students. FEMHacks 2.0 is open to all UC Berkeley students with beginner and intermediate-level Hackathon experience. Our event is hybrid this year, which means that we welcome anyone who can join us in person, but also any interested students beyond the Bay who may only be able to join virtually.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our 9-hour Hackathon will foster a positive working environment for students who want to develop a Software Engineering, Mobile App Development, Web Development, or Server-Side Programming project. We encourage you to apply in a partnership or group, and we will allocate time for group formation at the start of the event if you are unable to find a group beforehand. Come build your skill-set and get exposure to new design techniques and technical skills through FEMHacks workshops, tentatively on Design and Web Dev. For attendees who want additional support, FEMHacks will offer mentorship from experienced Mentors who can guide and support our hackers in working on a project of their choice.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our mission at FemTech is to empower and inspire CS students and we welcome any female, non-binary, and gender minority students to join us in support of FEMTech\u2019s mission. We hope you will join us at the Jacobs Design Institute (Jacobs Hall) on April 23rd from 9 am to 6 pm for FEMHacks (lunch is included).</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FEMHacks sign-up form:</strong> <a href=\"https://bit.ly/femhacks2signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/femhacks2signup</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FEMHacks mentorship volunteer form:</strong> <a href=\"https://bit.ly/femhacks2mentor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/femhacks2mentor</a>.</p>\n<p><b>FEMHacks workshop contributor or lead form: </b><a href=\"https://bit.ly/femhacks2workshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/femhacks2workshop</a></p>", "created": "2022-04-21T05:08:04Z", "subject": "FEMHacks 2.0", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l28jm4am16j5rk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16885, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538433541, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbe7104st5g764", "name": "Zaina Shaik", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbe7104st5g764"], "tags": ["announcements", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 232}
