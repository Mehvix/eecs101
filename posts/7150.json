Maybe do a few online tutorials first on the type of project you want to build (web dev probably has the lowest barrier to entry?), and then just dive in and try to own whatever you&#39;re building from start to finish. You&#39;ll probably learn a lot from the process - things like how software components come together, common programming/design patterns, lots of debugging, basic\u00a0shell commands, and how to google &amp; ask the right questions on stack overflow. It&#39;ll also give you stuff to talk about in an interview.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that being said, if your goal is to do well in school and maximize your GPA, it may be worth to preview 61C.

You don&#39;t necessarily need to prepare for 61C ahead of time (or study the entire thing) and personal projects are something you can invest as much time into as you see fit. I think experience will be just as important in the future for you as your GPA, so a personal project is a great choice, but you can try to invest maybe a couple hours a week into 61C (based on how your life goes) to just get yourself accustomed to the material/work.
