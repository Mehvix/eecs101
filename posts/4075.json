You might need to know some kinematics, and you should be familiar with some stuff like newtons laws, springs, angular momentum, etc, but these will mainly show up somewhat sparingly on the homework. The exams usually do not have parts that heavily rely on 7A material, although I cannot guarantee that because I&#39;m speaking solely from experience.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-04-27T04:46:48Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>In my opinion, CS61C and CS170 are pretty heavy workloads...taking 4 technicals in itself will be a large workload.
