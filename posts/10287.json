Interested in mentoring high schoolers? Want to guide highschoolers in their own research projects? Cal SENDforC wants YOU!</p>\n<p><br />Cal Support Encourage and Develop for Children, SENDforC (sendforc.org), is a new STEM mentoring club on campus that targets underrepresented minorities in STEM. Currently, we have a partnership with two high schools in the bay called Summit K2 and Summit Tam where we teach 9th -11th graders every Wednesday from 3:45-5pm. This semester we are diving deeper into the topics of biology and CS/data science/engineering. The role of the mentor is not only to mentor these kids on a weekly basis, but also help out and lead committees that focus on developing curriculum, workshops, club outreach, design, or finance. We are looking for mentors that are above all, passionate and reliable. If your schedule is not able to accommodate the weekly mentoring sessions, the committees definitely have room for your contribution and leadership.
