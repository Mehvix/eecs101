I also applied for some internship positions in the Fall of 2021, and also got some interviews. As a result, I think you'll be fine for the Summer of 2021, and Fall of 2021, but you need to start applying now. I'm also sure that you will be able to get internships in the Spring of 2022 and Summer of 2022 if you're allowed take an extra semester. Not sure if it's possible to land an internship after you're forced to graduate though. </md>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-01-17T22:02:09Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11588": 5, "1165": 8, "12204": 3, "13264": 9, "13830": 0, "13935": 4, "318": 2, "5771": 6, "7567": 7, "9260": 1}}, "created": "2021-01-15T18:08:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "lscs", "peer_directed", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<md>So I am in a weird spot when it comes to applying for internships this year.
