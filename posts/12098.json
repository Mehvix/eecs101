This is what I found out about summer CS 61C:\n\n- 2 labs per week (CS 61C labs are super long and you might spend time outside of lab to complete them)\n- 2 homeworks per week (very long ones) if there&#39;s no project OR 1 homework and a PROJECT \n- Midterm 1 on week 3, Midterm 2 on week 5 or 6, and the final exam on week 8\n\nBasically, you might have hell weeks (plenty of them actually) like so:\n- 2 labs, a homework or 2 and a project due in the same week\n- 1 lab, a homework, a lab, and a midterm\n- 1 lab, a homework and a final. \n- 2 labs and 2 homeworks\n\nThis is data that I just got from the summer 2018 CS61C schedule. CS61C is very intense. Something like Data 100 &amp; CS 188 might work but CS61C with any other technical class will be hell but who am I to scare you from doing so?
