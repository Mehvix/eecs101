In case CS 182 does end up getting offered for Spring 2022 (I&#39;ve seen a post on here that suggests it may not), I was wondering what my chances are in terms of enrolling/getting off the waitlist. I managed to enroll in CS 188 this semester although I was basically on the waitlist until day 2 of instruction; should I expect something similar? Or even worse? But since I&#39;ve heard that the class may not even be offered next semester, should I wait till I&#39;m a senior?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, a bit more generally, what is the workload of CS 182 in comparison to classes like CS 188, Data 100, CS 61A/B, etc? Broadly speaking, what will be the main focus (math or theory or coding or all three)? I don&#39;t plan on taking CS 189 but I should complete CS 188 by the end of this semester. Since 189 is recommended, should I be concerned?
