Now, I am on the waitlist, but as the site also specifies, this error will not come up on joining the waitlist and instead later when reaching the top of waitlist.\u00a0Seeing the followup on &#64;11130, I now suspect this may happen to me once I reach the top of the waitlist despite\u00a0the site stating that I should be allowed to enroll in both.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) The above student should be allowed to enroll in both 100 and 117, since one of them allows conflicts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How should both of us go about ensuring that we can each enroll in\u00a0both our classes?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-01-08T01:47:13Z", "subject": "Time conflicts....", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I want to take Data 100 and Psych 117 at the same time but there&#39;s a 30 min time conflict.
