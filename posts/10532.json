I think 161 is more universal in the way of thinking it wants you impart to you (you can always be trying to make your code more secure no matter what you&#39;re doing) whereas networking might be more niche. If you are looking for a specific role, like security analyst or networking programmer, they would obviously prefer the relevant class.<div><br /></div><div>The workload is very similar between both. I think 161 is now a design course and 168 is not; however this isnt related to workload in this case.</div><div><br /></div><div>Neither course has any direct relation with ML. I guess there are some security ML startups that have been popping up, but that doesn&#39;t mean 161 will help with 182 or 189.\u00a0 Same goes for 168.</div><div><br /></div><div>162 includes a couple lectures about networking, so 168 might be marginally useful there.

For 161 in particular, I think taking 168 helps a lot to understand the primitives of network security (it is helpful to understand what is the system that you are trying to secure). Other than that, in general 161 is more useful because you will (most of the times) have to write secure code. 168 is awesome if you want to learn how to design and architect systems and if you want to learn modularity. Honestly this course teaches so many concepts that a lot of classes do not teach (end-to-end layering is very important and should apply to all good system designs you will write ever).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, something that I found of great value was the quality of the professor teaching the course. Yes, we have a bunch of professors in EECS that do cool stuff. But Scott and Sylvia (she&#39;s teaching next sem) in particular have done incredible advances on the field. Scott invented SDN which is one of the most important technologies used in datacenters and virtuallization today. Sylvia invented DHT, which is one of the pillars on which Bit Torrent is built. Also their anecdotes are very interesting and they&#39;ll spend some time of class talking about them</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tl;dr if can take both, if not take 161 if you want something useful across the board or 168 for design thinking and engaged (and leading in the field) professors</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2019-10-23T22:21:10Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-23T20:52:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box", "enrollments", "peer_directed", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m a Sophomore who will be taking CS170 next semester.
