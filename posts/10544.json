I mean 16B shouldn&#39;t be too bad for ya since you&#39;ve taken all the following courses, but it is a lot of homework and lab. If you like data science/the more mathier stuff, you&#39;ve taken or will be taking all the core (I&#39;m assuming prob 140 will balance out EECS 126). Maybe take it easy because course workloads will be heavy. You could also try expanding into more specialized ML/AI/DS stuff. For example, any applied classes in data science. For me, I&#39;m less into the pure data analysis and like the modeling from it, especially when it comes to signal based things like speech and vision. So courses like 120, 123, 184, and info 159 are useful to me. If you like data analysis for economic contexts, maybe an econ class.
