Does this mean if I ever get off the waitlist, I would lose my language class enrollment and have to re-enroll? I recently tried to sign up for another class during phase 2 and it said I was above my maximum units (guessing it counted the c100 I had waitlisted as 4 more units =16 total) but I swapped another class (cs 162) with cs 160 and it put me on the waitlist again. So now am I actually at 20 units of enrollment but if I get off the 100/160 waitlist I&#39;d lose my enrollment in my other two classes? And if I were to drop and re-enroll say my language class right now would I get to keep my waitlist spot on cs c100 or does that disappear too?
