A lot of what you do in projects at UCB are designing and building code and software. \nIn my experience, there is a lot of fixing and maintaining of the code base and system structure all the time. - This is more hands on and frankly almost no coding at all (most of the time).\nThe difference between software engineering and being a computer scientist is a feat of how applicable you can solve a real life problem in real time.\nCompared to my internships in the past, I&#39;d say that the workload at work as a full-time (since mine is a startup) is far more rigorous and demanding than coursework because you have to learn something,\nwhere hand holding and structured teaching doesn&#39;t exist and you have to self-learn and own up to responsibilities that really aren&#39;t your creations, which takes more time than you&#39;d think.\nIt depends on you here because how driven you are will give you that satisfaction of doing something great or stressing out because you&#39;ve got too much.\nI was lucky enough to have a great boss and know the CTO and directors to take sometime off when necessary for school for like midterms, finals, and projects when the workloads intersected with work deadlines.\nWhat you should worry about most of the time is your manager/boss, because they will stem your workflow and help you when you need it most or make things worse.\nMost tech companies don&#39;t do the whole 9-5 thing because they really just care about how much work you get done or how many tasks you have completed since most are salary based.\nAlso, it should be noted that those in the industry will work longer and harder because of that bonus and their stock options/units.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated":
