This is because 7b is technically a lower div. This actually happened to me this semester -- I kept putting off 7b in favor of tech classes, and when I&#39;d fulfilled all of my other major requirements (except 7b), the hold was imposed because I was no longer fulfilling the 2 major requirements / semester (even if I was taking 2 EECS techs this semester). This is just a personal experience, but if you&#39;re planning on leaving 7b until your last semester, you might want to consider planning out your schedule really, really carefully to make sure you&#39;re fulfilling 2 reqs / sem so you still get the Phase 1 planned for you (otherwise, it&#39;s delayed a week afaik).</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6levsbn1v72em", "name": "Woojin Ko", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6levsbn1v72em"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-11-09T20:33:25Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-11-05T07:44:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>How\u00a0easy is it for an upperclassman/senior to enroll in a lower div class like physics 7B?
