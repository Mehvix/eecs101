After thinking about it though, it seems like it might be more beneficial to take 61C next semester and do an internship over summer (currently, I have 61C scheduled for the summer). If I were to take 61C next semester, I would either self-study 61B or take 47B in addition to self studying.\n\nI was wondering if anyone who has taken 47B, or knows people who have taken it, could share what their experience was like. What was the general workload of the class and were the midterms / final exam comparable to those of 61B or are they easier? Would skipping 47B and 61B entirely, and instead self-studying the material be sufficient to do well in interviews / upper division classes?\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.
