You may also want to check out Math 136 which covers similar topics to CS 172 but is offered far more often. I would also recommend Math 110 or EE 127 as linear algebra is pretty foundational to many of the courses you want to take.</p>", "created": "2020-07-01T21:43:00Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kc3vz8ms53m1o5", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kc3naokvdh77n9", "name": "Max Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["kc3naokvdh77n9", "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 6/28 - 7/4", "bucket_order": 29, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-07-02T18:12:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kc53wr5lfbr676", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Your schedule seems a bit too difficult in your second year.
