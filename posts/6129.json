On the website it indicates that the acceptance rate for the 2016-2017 academic year for freshman was<strong> 6.6%</strong>. A different source indicates the percentage was <strong>7.8%</strong> back in 2015. Additionally, not more than a decade ago, the acceptance rate for Cal EECS was roughly triple the current percentage. Regarding MIT, I think the number you provided is for their <em>graduate</em> program. They do not accept by major, rather you are accepted by the university, and then at the end of your first year you pick a track (major). Unless things have changed the last two years, this was the process according to a friend of mine who attended 2012-2016. The\u00a0most recent data regarding their acceptance rate sits at about <strong>7.9%.\u00a0</strong>So in comparison to MIT, just going by acceptance rate, it is <em>comparable</em>. The number provided for Stanford was correct.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, even with this low acceptance rate, a large (by comparison) number of people are being admitted for two reasons: The sheer number of applicants and the requirement that Cal educate California. Using MIT again, they have close to 500 undergraduate EECS majors and Cal has nearly triple that amount. To match the numbers, Cal EECS acceptance rate would have to drop below even Stanford, and given that Cal is a public university, that is unlikely.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that said, given that the university has indirectly admitted to mistakes in financial management, better planning was absolutely necessary and I wholeheartedly agree. It is important to note that I am only speaking in regards to the EECS department, and by extension, EE and CS courses. Regarding overcrowding, it appears some measures have been put in place (not allowing intentional failing and raising the GPA cap for L&amp;S). Though I could be completely off base about that. I too would like to hear an instructor&#39;s input on the matter with respect to sustainability.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a":
