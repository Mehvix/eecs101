Go to CalCentral, click on \"My Academics,\" and then scroll all the way down to the bottom right of the page. You will see a section called \"Transfer Credit.\"\n1. Click \"Transfer Credit Report.\" This report will include AP units and transfer units from any community college transcripts that you have submitted.\n1. Write down which parts of the Transfer Credit Report are incorrect so that you can bring them up with an advisor or (if they are very obvious) so that you can open a case with [Cal Student Central](https://studentcentral.berkeley.edu/services-areas-support/). For example, I opened a case because my CC transcript clearly was not processed at all, and my ticket was handled promptly and effectively.\n    * Remember that if you were just accepted as a freshman or transfer student, they might not have processed your transcripts yet. When I was admitted, I was told that my transcripts would not be processed until November.\n    * Remember that **not all classes qualify for transfer credit**. For example, I took some CS classes at CC while I was in high school, and they did not give me any transfer units for them. To check whether units will transfer for a class, you should check [Assist](https://assist.org/). I think that you should click \"View Agreement by: Department\" to see the correct agreement, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you are worried that you have too many units (rather than too few), then it might be helpful to know that units earned when you were in high school do not count toward the unit cap that forces you to graduate, as stated [here](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/unit-ceiling-and-semester-limit).</md>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-07-19T02:15:19Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/18 - 7/24", "bucket_order": 50, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-07-19T05:46:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kra7gbzqpxm3d5", "subject": "<p>Thank you for your suggestions.
