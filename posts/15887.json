Note, there is a course by the same Professor, Robert Sedgewick, that is 61b. As for the probability courses, I know Data140 is supposed to be singular, but I might also consider this self-studyable since there are at least 2 highly developed MOOCS I am aware of, namely on EdX, one by Professor Joseph Blitzstein, and another by Professor John Tsitsiklis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now that I am writing, I believe cs189 is also more self-studyable than not. Most of the material is available, and I think there may be an old edX course that is acessible.
