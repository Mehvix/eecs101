It&#39;s also &#34;just right&#34; in terms of conceptual difficulty and workload, so, yeah, I&#39;d take it as soon as is feasible for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among the classes you listed for that last slot in your schedule, they all seem to have around the same workload, with 126 lying on the heavier side. If they&#39;re all of similar interest to you, I&#39;d recommend taking whichever works best with your schedule, to be honest. This comes with the implicit encouragement that you should be going to lecture and office hours in your upper divs for sure so that you will have a way of getting letters of recommendation in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One thing I didn&#39;t mention in my last comment was that 126 with Kannan Ramchandran was the best-taught class I have ever taken (and I took 120 the same semester as Anon Atom). It&#39;s literally what comes to mind when the concept of a stereotypically picture-perfect college lecture is brought up in conversation or whatever. I would specifically recommend that you take 126 with Kannan (and put a lot of effort into it as well).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Maybe I oversold myself, but I&#39;m a grad student that is advised by a circuits prof in BWRC and a prof at UCSF. I have no BioE background other than the BioE research I did as an undergrad in Prof. Michel Maharbiz&#39;s research group here (produced a few of the founders of Neuralink; also Prof. Maharbiz spun out his own startup, which was recently sold for a couple hundred million dollars), and the fact that I&#39;ve read many papers regarding medical devices as a result. I kind of stumbled onto the field and have no real sentimental attachment to it or anything, but I definitely always feel like I am working on something that can change lives, and that is pretty satisfying, I suppose. However, it is not a field for people that aren&#39;t comfortable with animal experiments. I&#39;m a vegetarian and needed to explicitly come to terms with this on my own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of getting involved in this sort of thing, I think it depends a little bit on whether you want to focus more on the &#34;medical&#34; part or the &#34;devices&#34; part. For the former, and for applications such as prosthetics, I think BioE classes can impart real value and help inform your design process as an engineer. For the latter, especially for miniature integrated systems (what I work on), most of the real design work is at the circuit and fabrication level, so specific medical knowledge isn&#39;t always necessary. I myself got into this sort of thing just because it&#39;s a hot area of research among circuits people, and I like circuits.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;d like to be a &#34;devices&#34; person, like me, I&#39;d recommend diving deep in the circuits and signal processing coursework I mentioned and then sending a cold email to grad students in whichever BSAC or BWRC lab is doing work that appeals to you so that you can get involved in research. Similar advice goes for the other case, although I can&#39;t necessarily give lab advice (although I have heard that Prof. Steven Conolly is very nice).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of career outlook, I&#39;d aim to do a 5th Year MS and then dip to Verily or Neuralink or another prosperous biotech firm, at least if you feel like &#34;getting your hands dirty&#34;. You could also consider doing a PhD, as I am, which is a financially poor investment, in general, but can empower you to play a bigger role in design after you graduate (with the PhD). In biotech, there isn&#39;t really a shortage of PhDs, so they get the cool innovative work by default (that&#39;s also what doing a PhD is supposed to be about anyway).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helps! :^)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["k1zl10wlpt9gd"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-03-28T05:30:49Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-03-28T15:27:00Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kmtbfovcfon47e", "subject": "<p>thank you so much this was really helpful!!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-03-28T15:27:00Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-04T15:18:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kn3b7ipsx3y176", "subject": "<p>I was late to this post but @Averal I just wanted to ask whether I would need a 5th year MS to do medical devices since I&#39;m interested in that area as well even though I have no knowledge in &#34;medical&#34; at all as much as devices.
