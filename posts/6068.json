The best way is to be really familiar with your past experience.\u00a0You should go through all the things you have done for school,\u00a0extra curricular activities, and if you have it, your work experience.\u00a0You should think about times that you have demonstrated creativity, problem solving ability, dedication, the ability to work in a team, the ability to lead a team, or anything you are particularly proud of. It may be difficult to think of\u00a0examples of some of these but it is likely you can think of examples of most if not all.\u00a0<br /><br />I think it is likely you have worked in a team setting but if you really can&#39;t think of a time that you have worked in a team setting I suggest you join a club that will let you work with a team. Regardless, you should do this for more reasons than just the\u00a0machiavellian purpose of having things to talk about in an interview. Most large, important things done in the world are done in teams (which is why companies want to know you can work in them) so\u00a0learning to work effectively with others is important. Additionally, you can learn from the people you work with and working with people can be fun.\u00a0<br /><br />Don&#39;t ever say you don&#39;t\u00a0have experience\u00a0with a situation posed in a behavioral interview (unless it&#39;s something ridiculous, working in a team or using technology are both very reasonable). There is a reason they want to hear what you have to say and telling them nothing will invariable work against you. Even if you can&#39;t think of a perfect experiential fit say something that fits as close as possible. Behavioral questions are more about demonstrating thoughtfulness and positive personal attributes rather than\u00a0listing experience\u00a0(they have your resume which is already that) so there is a lot of latitude in what a &#34;good answer&#34; looks like.<br /><br />Don&#39;t just apply to startups, apply to all the places you think you would like to work at and would be a good fit at, they will decide if they want to hire you. You never know what they will do, most apps are short anyways. \u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-01-17T17:45:47Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jcjcywnl9de1do", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p95o6kj0fa", "name": "Darien Parris", "photo": "1484759193_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p95o6kj0fa/1484759193_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9s6omub10j", "name": "Jeanelle Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "ireb05q4pq01oe": 1, "irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "name": "Nitzan Orr", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7xzyjm66ic", "name": "Edgar Barboza Nunez", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipxjx49hzgs1di", "name": "Jennifer Zou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p95o6kj0fa", "is6p9s6omub10j", "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "is6p7xzyjm66ic", "iscem14kbsu5vi", "ipxjx49hzgs1di"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/14 - 1/20", "bucket_order": 116, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/14 - 1/20", "bucket_order": 116, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-17T23:02:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jcjoakohybk7c5", "subject": "<p>I&#39;ve mentioned things from all sorts of activities.
