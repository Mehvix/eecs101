They usually would have expanded the course by now, but they havent, so im not sure if they will. \n\nAlso i remember an earlier thread saying people drop the course a lot early cause they realize how heavy the courseload is, but berkeleytime data doesnt really support this. Theres always the 10% rule, and I think the class is at like 220 right now, so with that you would have a decent shot, but id wait it out a bit if I were you.
