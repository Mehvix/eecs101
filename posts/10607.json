I was originally planning on taking cs 168, 169, and 170, but 169 got cancelled and 170 is currently locked. I&#39;m managed to get into 168, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what other classes to take. I&#39;ve taken 161, 162, 186, and 188 and was thinking of trying C100, but it seems redundant to take that after 186, or maybe 152, but I&#39;m really software focused so I have no idea if that would be any use at all for industry. If anyone could advise me of any other classes available for Spring that won&#39;t be too intense, that would be great.
