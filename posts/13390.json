I think EECS\u2019 expectation is that students take 16A/B <em>before</em> taking CS 70, which is required in order to declare. I&#39;m not positive but I think this might be why the instructors are allowing more undeclared students a spot, to encourage them to take it and not skip it and go straight to 70/declaring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that intention is wrong since it comes from a pedagogical place of wanting to get students to take things in a specific order according to how they structure they courses, but I don&#39;t really agree with the way they choose to &#34;enforce&#34; it by not really making that a strict requirement and also applying pressure on undeclared L&amp;S students to get a good grade in 61A/B/70.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a freshman, I dropped 16B and decided instead to focus on getting a good grade in 61B and 70 and declaring, and I think the rationale was sound and I was even advised to do this by peer mentors. I mean, really, if you can&#39;t even declare CS, then how will 16B help you? (Perhaps data science as an alternative, but ask many in the DS/ML route and they&#39;ll say 16A/B is still not enough lin. alg. preparation. and would say 54/110 is more effective since they are not trying to teach EE as well.) I think it has been well demonstrated by the hoards of students in your position and in mine, who are trying to get into 16B later on, that 16B is not necessary to do well in 70 and beyond.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope they do something about this system soon, since there are conflicting opinions currently on how a L&amp;S CS student should go about their classes and that makes it confusing and stressful for a lot of us.\u00a0 If faculty really believe that taking 16B is imperative before 70 and the UD courses, then this should be an <em>enforced</em> requirement in declaring. If it is not an enforced requirement, then students should not be punished by faculty/the department for not listening to their suggested course path.
