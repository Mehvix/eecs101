You can model most things as graphs, some of which you&#39;ve encountered in\u00a0those classes you mentioned:</p>\n<ul><li>models of human social networks</li><li>models of computer networks</li><li>models of physical networks (e.g. transportation of goods)</li><li>models of any systematic process (cf a graphical representation of following a procedure / algorithm)\n<ul><li>specifically, models of\u00a0<em>how computer programs work</em> (either the flow of the code itself, or models like automata / Turing machines)</li></ul>\n</li><li>models of anything with states (e.g. modelling a randomized process like Markov processes or the structure of the subproblems in any DP algorithm)\n<ul><li>including things that we only have sketchy state representations of (e.g. human language models like n-gram models)</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Also, there are things that aren&#39;t really inherently graphs, but that we can convert <em>into\u00a0</em>graphs (e.g. all of the reductions between NP-complete problems you&#39;ve learned in CS170, or any feature representation of any real-world phenomenon that we use graph-based ML algorithms like random forests or neural networks).</p>\n<p>And I&#39;m sure other things that are slipping my mind right now, or that I just don&#39;t know.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So yes, every class that teaches about graphs does so for good reasons: because they&#39;re applicable to the topic. Sometimes there&#39;s overlap, and sometimes there&#39;s not. Aside from 61A and 61B (as intro courses, they&#39;ll naturally have more overlap with advanced courses), the other 4 courses you mention don&#39;t have much overlap.</p>\n<p>(170 and 188 has the most overlap out of the four, but they&#39;re not prereqs for each other, so each class can&#39;t assume that the student already knows the\u00a0basic\u00a0topics.)</p>\n<p>(61B and 170 also has a lot of overlap, but empirically, I know that many students\u00a0<em>have </em>forgotten what they&#39;ve learned in 61B, unfortunately, sometimes including basic terminology. Whether for better or for worse, the course staff\u00a0has elected\u00a0to simply do a speedy review of the material, as opposed to simply assuming students have already fully mastered 61B material. This is more a pedagogy question about what prereqs means, than anything specific about graphs)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For your final question:\u00a0in order to understand an advanced\u00a0technique, you (usually) should start by mastering the basic techniques. That&#39;s what college is for.\u00a0You can learn the state-of-the-art algorithms once you&#39;re in industry/grad school, once you have a solid mastery of the fundamentals.</p>", "created": "2017-01-02T06:01:45Z", "subject": "", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h"}], "id": "ixfohtj9wmi3wp", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzdno37f81b1b5", "name": "Allen Guo", "photo": "1452282490_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzdno37f81b1b5/1452282490_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"global": 1513018038, "ixxlkoprjq27g5": 1, "j629r4lpe9x7ng": 1, "jccfhudcwn91h2": 1519852239}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguxwsyxds1ie", "name": "Kijung Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ij5ddqc0arp6r4": 1, "j6fe5friemd22w": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "id1up5lrn3o215", "name": "Alvin Hsu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ids66zeithd2ov": 1, "ijltj19y6lv59e": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hlx51hr3snv1zn", "name": "Yiqun Chen", "photo": "1454110371_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hlx51hr3snv1zn/1454110371_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrinkfj99i10b", "name": "Nikhil Patel", "photo": "1503789172_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idrinkfj99i10b/1503789172_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icj74070p6j1fi", "name": "Dibya Ghosh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"global": 1, "imm91o6q8qv5hg": 1, "is758hjb2yo2sy": 1, "ixwkta02en780": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy7g0roh1q3", "name": "Aditya Baradwaj", "photo": "1455863575_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/icguy7g0roh1q3/1455863575_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzdno37f81b1b5", "icguxwsyxds1ie", "id1up5lrn3o215", "hlx51hr3snv1zn", "idrinkfj99i10b", "icj74070p6j1fi", "icguy7g0roh1q3"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 1/1 - 1/7", "bucket_order": 170, "children": [{"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 1/1 - 1/7", "bucket_order": 170, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-03T17:36:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixhsr0c6i8e5hx", "subject": "<p>I think he is Linguistics and sociology minors.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-01-03T17:36:25Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/1 - 1/7", "bucket_order": 170, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-03T17:56:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixhthgkq58f1hd", "subject": "<p>There isn&#39;t a sociology minor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My majors were CS, Sociology, and Linguistics.
