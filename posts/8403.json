I think it kind of depends on your purpose. While I haven&#39;t taken it, having helped friends with 188 homework makes me believe 188 may present some AI material (heuristics, game theory etc.) that isn&#39;t used so much nowadays since statistical machine learning/deep learning is the dominant form of &#34;AI&#34; (personally dont like that name designation) nowadays due to it being much easier to get results with. To prepare for statistical learning theory classes like 189 126 is definitely more useful, (since it teaches the Kalman filter, MLE , MAP , EM algorithm etc.), but if you want an overview of AI from a wholistic perspective without going too heavy in depth 188 would still be nice to take</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "updated": "2019-01-05T06:36:02Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-12-18T09:06:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jptixp1x7b114a", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I think 126 will serve you better.
