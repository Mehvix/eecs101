But then, 170 seems to be a part of the unofficial rite of passage for CS majors at Berkeley and a compulsory class in most other schools (and kind of a staple for us).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think that internships care more about your actual projects and how you have used what you&#39;ve learned in class. You can always include the knowledge in your CV (if you have it ofc) and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll care a lot if it is something you self-studied. I myself would still recommend you to take the course because it will haze into a very deep understanding of the material that you might not get out of self-studying it unless you are very determined and disciplined. Again, your motivation for taking this class should be more about &#34;how I can be a better computer scientist and what knowledge and skillset I can get from this class&#34; rather than &#34;is this getting me an internship or not?&#34;.
