It&#39;s a more theoretical class than 127. We went into detail proving important theorems / lemmas in optimization. If I recall correctly, the only topic Math170 overlaps with CS170 is linear programming, which Math170 covers in quite greater depth, so I don&#39;t think they would be too repetitive. EE127 focuses a lot more on the modeling side and is mostly on convex optimization. It&#39;s a nice overview of the different types of convex optimization problems and how to formulate them into standard forms. It can be useful, but they are more straightforward to learn on your own.Overall, I would recommend taking Math170 since it goes more into theory.&#34;</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More generally, what are the differences between these two optimization courses in terms of the scope/depth of concepts covered as well as the foundational skills/understanding they teach?</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-06-29T18:55:00Z", "subject": "Math 170 vs EE 127", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j4ishub6cnu5iz", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 4467, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654551880642, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p73sapuj5vp", "name": "William Gan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p73sapuj5vp"], "tags": ["cs", "eecs", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 391}
