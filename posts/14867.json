I am also considering taking Econ 1 over the summer as well. CS 61BL is Session C (8 weeks) while Econ 1 is Session A (6 weeks). The last two weeks of Session A overlap with the first two weeks of Session C. So for two weeks, I would be taking Econ 1 and 61BL together with having to prepare for the Econ 1 final and adjusting to the pace and materials of CS 61BL during those two weeks. Does this seem doable? Has anyone had experience with this before? If so, how was it?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As background, I have had some experience with Java from high school APCSA.
