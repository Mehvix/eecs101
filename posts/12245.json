I would say workload is fairly comparable to 170, though perhaps a bit less (there are only HW &#43; exams, no projects. But HW can be difficult). The test difficult is very variant on the teacher/TA: when I took the class it had only been offered once before, and the exams that offering had were much easier than the ones that we had. One thing that is difficult is simply the lack of material that exists for studying besides the textbook.<br /><br />Content is essentially learning the basic framework for which cryptographic schemes are proved secure. The class goes in depth into the properties of a bunch of standard primitives like PRGs, hash functions, PRFs, etc. and will prove that some construction is a certain secure primitive, or use those primitives to build a secure protocol (like an IND-CPA encryption scheme), etc. I think the proof styles are very interesting and fun - mixing a bit of reduction techniques from 170 with some new paradigms such as adversarial games and hybrid arguments.</p>", "created": "2020-05-14T17:36:36Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6levraiass2e1"}], "id": "ka721gvuwjxvj", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8jylx2fl", "name": "Xinyun Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3kxe4et1xh1it", "name": "Parth Nobel", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1551343370, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548558104, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1574919273}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "name": "Priyans Desai", "photo": "1598406517_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjs6ge7urqc129/1598406517_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jgzlq1jxir04xm", "name": "Ankita Mitra", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jz9gltnmf1358i", "name": "Andrew Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6drmqck5kn100", "name": "Tushar Sharma", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p8jylx2fl", "j3kxe4et1xh1it", "jjs6ge7urqc129", "jgzlq1jxir04xm", "jz9gltnmf1358i", "j6drmqck5kn100"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10295": 5, "10349": 4, "11424": 0, "11561": 1, "1525": 6, "3777": 9, "6463": 8, "7903": 2, "8021": 3, "8928": 7}}, "created": "2020-05-14T09:31:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>As the title says.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This class will be offered in the Spring, as 171 I think.
