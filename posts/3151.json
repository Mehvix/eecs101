In state tuition is completely insignificant to the housing pricing in MV/SV ($3500/month for a single apartment, is a multiple worse than e.g. having a Wall Street apartment). For an incoming engineer, this is already half of post-tax salary; you barely save anything in your first years of work, and income can only gradually increase overtime by locking yourself in the same company for many years (because of the structure of bonus, stock options, etc.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. You biologically and mentally change throughout your years, learning and finding A is boring, B is too hard, C is too easy, D isn&#39;t actually what the media reports, etc. - while some amount of focus is valuable, something as hoop-jumping as &#34;graduating early&#34; only for the sake of saving money (and you don&#39;t even save much anyways) isn&#39;t a worthy cause</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. Planning to graduate early implies you&#39;ll just take all the requirements and not do anything you enjoy - we&#39;ve been through K-12 in a 7-3, studying boring things, and in a job, we go 9-5 doing sometimes boring work; college is one of the only times that we&#39;re allowed to take a break from that and cherish what we like, and can&#39;t be underestimated</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-01-14T00:03:59Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/8 - 1/14", "bucket_order": 173, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-14T00:15:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixwhf2aglfp6zk", "subject": "<p>What is MV/SV?
