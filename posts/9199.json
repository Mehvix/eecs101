The class is a mix of theory and systems, which I like a lot. However, unlike 162 much of the material is not explicitly required in interviews or most areas as a SWE, unless you plan to build, contribute to, or directly work with a parser or compiler (which is possible for some optimization projects, but a bit niche). However, if you&#39;re interested in systems at all definitely take the class. It seems like if you take it in the fall you can still do 162 in the spring, so I would recommend that.</p>", "created": "2019-04-17T08:17:44Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p94rzyszeb"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I loved CS164.
