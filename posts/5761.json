So what happened was I wanted to take EE126 but I am 99% sure I got passed because of my time conflict with EE16B (and now EE126 is full :( ) . So I rescheduled my schedule and am now trying to sign up for CS61C but it says there is a time conflict with CS 170 which I am in. I filled out the form on calcentral and the CS form but I still can&#39;t register for CS 61C. What should I do? I don&#39;t want CS 61C to become full too like EE126 and get passed up on!
