There&#39;s also posts on the Berkeley subreddit about easy CS classes. If you&#39;re L&amp;S CS you could maybe look into other technical electives that are also light - lots of not very technical courses (Linguistics 100 for example) count as technical electives, or take a breadth course. (But again if I had your schedule plus recruiting I would just stick with the classes you already have - I wouldn&#39;t even add a breadth course).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is9eicspikd4w2", "updated": "2020-08-28T19:09:25Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10399": 3, "2522": 9, "5201": 7, "5769": 8, "5770": 4, "6494": 5, "6947": 0, "7680": 1, "8408": 2, "8824": 6}}, "created": "2020-08-26T23:17:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m taking EE 16B, 61C, and a language class.
