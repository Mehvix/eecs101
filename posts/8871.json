In the past, I have struggled with mental health issues which I felt were driven both by identity issues as well as school. A while ago, my mental health improved substantially which has allowed me to reflect more seriously on the situation(s) that caused my depression/anxiety problems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be honest I think much of the stress within the department can be traced back to a couple faculty members who seem to think it&#39;s reasonable to ask for ~70-80 hours weekly commitment from students across all classes, if we are interested in diagnosing a cause. (all eyes on Sahai, only permitting students 30 minutes of &#34;serenity time&#34; per day). Obviously the competitiveness, stress of internships, etc. plays a role in the stress experienced by students, but the bulk of it stems from the above reason, in my opinion. I would argue quite strongly that the ridiculous workload exacerbates the stress of getting a job / research / internship because students have to spread themselves even more thinly to be able to achieve these. The large workload, coupled with a competitive environment, has caused a system wherein if the amount of work assigned is genuinely too much, most students will do it anyway, potentially sacrificing their mental health. This gives professors the idea that it is okay to assign this much work, when in fact it is contributing to a mental health crisis of unprecedented proportions (student mental health issues have reached an all time high, and Berkeley is worse than almost all other student bodies in this respect). <br /><br />Additionally, the size of the program is so large, it creates an impersonal experience for many students, who have little to no connection whatsoever with any faculty here, leading to widespread isolation. <br /><br />Releasing distributions on every single exam, project, hw, lab, etc causes students to make unnecessary comparisons with other students. I really like what EE127 is doing this semester in only releasing very rough grades (A/B/C cutoff scores) for the exam, and no distribution or statistics whatsoever. I used to (and still do to a certain extent) obsess over my standing on different assignments in the course, often <em>staring at the distributions </em>which were released<br /><br />For my first semester ever, I am taking 3 upper division CS technical courses. This is what is required every semester of students who do not come in with any AP credit to be able to graduate in the maximum 8 semesters allotted by CoE. I&#39;m surviving, and mentally I&#39;m doing well also, but it is <em><strong>absolutely insane.</strong></em><strong> (</strong>To be fair, the three techs are 127,189 and 161). Every time I finish one assignment I instantly have to turn around and finish something for another class. I find it imperative to make the point that having such insanely difficult course loads works to reinforce class boundaries between students. Wealthy students have already taken many AP courses, and can simply focus on their two technical courses per semester, whereas a poor student has to take 3 courses a semester <strong>and may have to work a part time job to support themselves financially. </strong>I don&#39;t see the workload being tamed any time soon, but I do see it as important to make this point.<br /><br />I could, and probably will at a later time go on, but I&#39;m gonna get back to studying for 189 now ;)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>would be curious to hear what other students think</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-03-17T01:40:58Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/17 - 3/23", "bucket_order": 53, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/17 - 3/23", "bucket_order": 53, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-18T01:15:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jtdnqd60nog7i6", "subject": "<p>partial credit can be really frustrating, especially when you feel like you were 90% of the way there but cannot get partial credit due to the grading policy of the exam.
