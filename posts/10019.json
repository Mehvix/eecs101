For the first half of the semester, the classes cover completely different material, so 134 will only increase your workload. But 134 covers 95% of the probability material before 70 gets to it, so the second half of the class felt very easy. All in all though I wouldn&#39;t take both courses together if you&#39;re concerned about getting a B&#43;, since it might be better to just focus on studying for 70 than to take another tech. You could always use the online 140 textbook (or something like that) to study continuous probability in more depth than what 70 has.
