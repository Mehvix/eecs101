This continues to hold as long as you have taken 16AB and do not have have some weakness in vector calculus or linear algebra. Being able to reason probabilistically and have intuition about it is very important. 70 is not really enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) If you have weakness in linear algebra or vector calculus or have not taken 16AB, then 127 is the most important course to prepare for 189. You will experience significant difficulties without that understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) If you have taken 16AB and 127, for many students, taking 110 could become largely redundant. A student in that position should take the 110 textbook and read it on their own. See if you need more.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, hopefully everyone understands that both 126 and 127 are *more* fundamental courses to take than 189 if you are interested in machine learning. And if you have to pick only one of the three courses: 126, 127, and 189; then 127 is clearly the most important\u00a0one to take for students regardless of their area. There are lots of machine learning applications\u00a0in 127.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In light of this, the most reasonable course of action is for interested students to take both 126 and 127 before 189. And if because of time pressure to graduate they want to take one concurrently with 189, that course is likely 189. (Although it is better understood as taking 189 concurrently with 127.)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Courses are far more rewarding if you can really understand what is going on. None of these courses are gratuitously difficult or anything like that, but truly engaging with the material does require hard work and building up your understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I understand that the fashionable name and interesting subject matter\u00a0of 189 is appealing, but when you&#39;re seven weeks into the course, trust me, no amount of fashionability is going to help you out or even make you feel any better. Understanding probability and optimization well will.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-10-20T20:25:19Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j90ch9acms540p", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hc6qtswtj87bi", "name": "Ye Wang", "photo": "1521329882_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hc6qtswtj87bi/1521329882_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy1ryd69htm417", "name": "Samyak Parajuli", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9ii2njqq5", "name": "Vaikunth Balaji", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1nm9ystr6tv", "name": "Bob Zhou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6y4cble5r5", "name": "Dinesh Parimi", "photo": "1536104810_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6y4cble5r5/1536104810_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "name": "Logan Howard", "photo": "1471912865_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hccnzx9ezt97j7/1471912865_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jc9f97h7meo5pq": 1521433550}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j52tu6m8x47le", "name": "Rahul Rathi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4judi4q46p", "name": "Simon Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hc6qtswtj87bi", "iy1ryd69htm417", "is6p9ii2njqq5", "hzd1nm9ystr6tv", "is6p6y4cble5r5", "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "j52tu6m8x47le", "j6nu4judi4q46p"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/22 - 10/28", "bucket_order": 127, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/22 - 10/28", "bucket_order": 127, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-10-23T03:37:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j93mt79cw2n1cf", "subject": "<p>Your first assumption cannot be justified wholly.</p>\n<p>Also, this is a question for the Math department, not EECS Piazza.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2017-10-23T03:37:51Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/22 - 10/28", "bucket_order": 127, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-10-23T05:35:28Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j93r0g946vy63q", "subject": "<p>The reason I asked it here is that professors/course staff would know better how much overlap there is between said courses.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-10-23T05:35:28Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-10-23T03:15:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j93m0xffsie5n7", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Since 16AB &#43; 127 seem to cover what Math 110 does, would it be reasonable to petition to the Math department excluding Math 110 from the minor requirement if 16AB and 127 are taken?
