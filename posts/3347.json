We kind of pair programmed it, splitting into pairs working on tasks. For some things that were really simple, like some of the easier syscalls, one person would just take it themselves. You&#39;ll spend a good amount of time as a group of 4 discussing your design for your design document, and that&#39;ll help make it a little more clear on what tasks can kind of be separated. Also, we found it helpful to physically meet with the whole team, even if we were going to split into 2s. This way we could pull people to discuss a flaw in the design we chose or to have a fresh set of eyes on things. You&#39;ll find out pretty quickly what works best for you and your group.\u00a0", "created": "2017-02-08T14:48:38Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hktxrfgogof36c"}], "id": "iyx2lwjyhgq2gj", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ib1dv064iwzzf", "name": "Sam Khano", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ib1dv064iwzzf"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-08T02:59:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "cs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hey!
