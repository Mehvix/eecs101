If they had put in a somewhat blunt manner that the DS major does&#39;t adequately prepare students for advanced degrees, I would have not written my initial comment. Instead, they chose to use language that was both denigrating and useless. Calling a major a &#34;joke&#34; does not serve to advance any knowledge nor does it respect the guidelines set out for discourse on this forum. Second, the DS major here is one of the most open-ended degrees one can acquire meaning that if one were to have aspirations of grad school, they could certainly attain the proper &#34;theoretical foundations&#34; for such a path. For example, a student primarily interested in ML could take EECS 126 for their probability requirement, Info 154 or 159 and Stat 135 for their computational requirement, CS 189 for their machine learning requirement, and EECS 127 and Math 118 for a domain emphasis in Applied Math. This took me 5 minutes to look up and barring any redundancy in classes I may not be aware of, certainly meets most definitions of adequate theoretical foundations. There seems to be this narrative on piazza that DS is a bad major for students who couldn&#39;t declare CS when in reality DS offers so much choice and freedom that to pigeonhole it doesn&#39;t make any sense and to call it lacking in mathematical rigor, frankly, stupid. It&#39;s up to the individual the level of rigor they want and whether you believe that is a good or bad thing is another topic of discussion, but to claim that the major is incapable of providing critical mathematical foundations for graduate school is just plain wrong.\u00a0Moreover, before anyone responds claiming I am arguing against a straw man and that DS is not as looked down upon as I am claiming it is, just a few posts ago someone said that DS100 was good enough to make you a python monkey, but nothing more which even if correct, is so incredibly out of line for a platform like piazza that the fact that someone was comfortable saying that and more importantly barely called out is completely emblematic of how DS is treated by the larger CS community at Berkeley.

I meant that many people who\u00a0take\u00a0the\u00a0DS major (without CS) plan to follow a path that do not take classes like 126, 127, stat 135, etc. As much as what you said is true by the books, the way it is currently, many people who are going to DS are using it as a backup major for CS if they can&#39;t declare.

What I meant to say was that, in my opinion, it is absolutely useless for someone to get a double major by doing DS when you already have a core major like CS, Stats or Applied Math and this is an opinion that has resonated multiple times on this forum, including instances where academic advisers themselves suggested the same.<br />The classes that you mentioned above are integral classes for other majors, not DS. Yes, DS majors can choose to take them but the majority of the DS majors who actually end up taking those classes/can handle them are primarily CS or Stat double majors and my point is that you don&#39;t have to add DS as a double major in order to take the classes you need.<br /><br />Lastly, about the &#34;joke&#34; part, I apologize for the naivety of my language. But if you&#39;re taking offence regarding DS majors getting downplayed, I think the facts cannot be ignored: much of the questions asked on the DS Piazza come from people who are figuring out how they can declare the major after either failing or doing poorly (or P/NP-ing) classes such as CS61A/B, Math 53/54/1AB, which are core foundational classes essential for doing well in theoretical upper-div EECS/Stat/Math classes and even grad school.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-01-08T09:26:44Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/6 - 1/12", "bucket_order": 65, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-08T19:36:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jqo5oz7w5i04q6", "subject": "<p>I&#39;ll be responding to primarily to the first commenter here, but I insist that both of you take a second to look at my arguments again. First, whether most DS majors choose to embark upon classes like 126, 127, etc is entirely irrelevant. The original post asked which of DS/Stats could adequately prepare a student for a future in ML. I am arguing that the DS major, through the fact that it is a largely multidisciplinary major, can in fact provide the foundations for ML and is not a &#34;joke.&#34; Whether most students choose to take those upperdivs is unrelated to this fact since I am attesting to the potential of the major. Moreover, since the OP is asking about the potential to learn ML from Stats/DS, the amount of students taking 126, 127, etc is rendered even more useless. Furthermore, if the initial comment was phrased as &#34;don&#39;t do CS and DS since they are largely redundant and will share too many classes to constitute a distinct learning experience&#34; I would have no problem. However, the comment was framed such that not only is DS a joke of a major, but if you&#39;re already doing CS it&#39;s even more of a joke. This is an indefensible comment that does not arise from naivety, but rather a dismissal of DS as a major. Second, the assertion that because Applied Math and Cogsci are disparaged by CS/EECS majors, DS being downplayed is no surprise or exception entirely misses the point of my frustration. If you want to be on the first floor of Moffitt calling DS a joke, that&#39;s entirely acceptable given the guidelines set out for open and public discourse. However, piazza is not a place for this kind of discussion and it is from my experience that DS is the most often of the &#34;backup CS majors&#34; to be openly ridiculed in this way. Now of course there is bias in my sample as DS is a relatively novel major when compared to Applied Math and Cogsci and, because of that fact, could be garnering more attention from the less polite among us; however, there is clear and recent evidence of disparaging comments being made on piazza and no matter your opinion on the content of the major, these kinds of statements are unhelpful and detrimental to students. Lastly, the claim that 126, 127, etc are not core classes for DS is equally true of CS if one were to choose a future where that material would be irrelevant (eg SWE, Consulting, etc); however, if a DS or CS student wanted to undertake an advanced degree in ML, then of course they would be core classes for both majors. In addition to this fact, your claims about the mathematical maturity in the DS population go entirely unsubstantiated and more so rely on a heavily biased sample. Piazza would naturally attract more students who are doing poorly and asking for course advice since that is what the piazza was set up to do, assist students who need help with decision making.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To wrap this all up, it may seem that I am some overly-triggered student launching a crusade against a single comment, but in reality, I believe that it is important to check these sorts of comments so that other students don&#39;t read them and think that it&#39;s okay or normal to simply bash an entire population of the student body. It is not about being sensitive to every little fact or detail, it&#39;s about encouraging fruitful discussion and contesting illogical and unhelpful claims.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-01-08T19:36:50Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/6 - 1/12", "bucket_order": 65, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-08T21:17:14Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jqo9a3lu2rx5p7", "subject": "<p>People ask on piazza to know the in-practice truth.
