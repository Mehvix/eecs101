Referral does not need to be from someone much older than you (although if it is a referral from senior exec I guess it does carry more weight - not because of position, but because that person has seen a lot more candidates over the years and the team usually trusts the the years of experience that person would have). It can be simply given by a friend you meet in class, work on a project together, work together really well, that friend ends up going to a company you are interested in, and refers you.</p>\n<p>The reason why companies look at referrals is because they need people to work in a team, and whether a person is a team player is difficult to be recognized through just coding interviews. If a person in a company is willing to work with you, they feel safer taking you in. (One bad hire far outweighs many good hires so companies really try hard to not make a bad hire)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now to more practically answer your question, you could just start off by making friends!</p>\n<p>- If you join clubs / organizations with people with similar interests, (like HKN - although they have a high bar), you will have plenty of friends who go on to work on a company you are interested in.</p>\n<p>- If you go to networking events, they can be helpful. I have met people who I clicked really well with and ended up getting referrals, but the time you spend getting to know each other is quite limited so use it as a starting point and get to know them better over the years. Look at handshake which lists all the career center events and rsvp to them to get started ;)</p>\n<p>- Utilize linkedin - emails and direct messages have a pleasantly surprising success rate (greater than 0% at least). Ask questions, if they live around, meet them up for coffee, make friends. Just asking for a referral through an email will practically never work, but you can find friends, and friends will give you a referral.</p>\n<p>- If you want a better answer than mine, make an appointment with a career center (through handshake). I would recommend Katie because she mostly works with engineering students and has some great resources to help get you started.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In all honestly, I would not be worried if you are a rising sophomore. I had only few friends going into those companies as a rising sophomore. Only the most dedicated would be finding internships at that point, and those internships would most likely be in small companies, some even unpaid. As you progress through the years you will naturally build up the network that you can utilize not only when you start looking for jobs, but throughout your entire career.
