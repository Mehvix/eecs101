As OP stated, there are so many other aspects of college that need to be explored. If I had been\u00a0held to a 3.3 cap, the anxiety and stress would be through the roof.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A new solution is certainly needed which\u00a0maintains the program&#39;s prestige but also fosters\u00a0a positive learning environment. I&#39;m glad people are talking about the\u00a0toxic negatives of this cap.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You may disagree with my viewpoint and that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m an advocate for unexperienced potential CS majors--and of course--a less toxic environment where risk to students&#39; mental health is mitigated.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#39;s hard to learn when quite high\u00a0standards (unrealistic for many) are put upon a student, given the holistic nature of college.\u00a0Anxiety/stress (a prime instigator of\u00a0depression) in\u00a0Cal students is a problem, much more than people realize. Overall, my stance is a relatively high LSCS GPA cap\u00a0diminishes overall learning.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_7", "updated": "2017-03-29T11:32:49Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-20T23:31:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs", "eecs", "suggestion_box", "other", "cs-intended", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Whats up everyone,\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This topic is something I constantly ponder. I noticed that in this Piazza, many instructors were gladly able to respond to other students opinions, concerns, and questions. So I decided.. why not!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So from a previous Piazza post, I read that the main reason why we have a 3.3 is that UC Berkeley doesn&#39;t have enough resources, both physically and financially, to accept everyone into the CS program. Then, why don&#39;t they follow the same thing as EECS: select students into the CS program, but since Berkeley doesn&#39;t have enough resources, just select less people into the CS program when they apply?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Personally (I might be able to speak for others as well), I have to give up a lot to shoot for this 3.3. And when I say give up, I don&#39;t mean gym, meals, social life.. etc. I dont care about that, thats a given when it comes to shooting for your dreams. What I mean are more important things - I have to temporarily give up CS clubs, my future start up plans, personal projects, etc. I&#39;m\u00a0pretty much\u00a0postponing my life CS goals for a number.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the biggest cookie coating support people give to others is: &#34;It&#39;s okay, you can still get into google if you don&#39;t declare in&#34;.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For me, and again I can\u00a0probably speak for others too, CS is more than just a spot on a Big 4 CS company. I came out of HS with straight C&#39;s and CS helped me find direction in my life and academics. And after putting my heart and everything into\u00a0it for these past years, someone is just going to tell me... go study something else that is &#34;related&#34;? So for the amount of work and sacrifice I did to get to where I am at now, I&#39;m just going to let a number stop me from studying CS? You bet it won&#39;t.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In summary, I just really believe there are better options than letting a number define someone&#39;s path and direction in life. I just really want to understand the thought processes of deciding on 3.3. What were the other solutions they were deciding on?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just to note: Thanks for reading this long post. I&#39;m not mad/sad in anyway. I&#39;ve been through worse, and I understand that this is life. But when I think about all the other students who are being prevented their freedom and passion of studying CS.. something just sparks in me.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks!\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-03-20T23:31:59Z", "subject": "Discussion on 3.3 GPA Cap: Was this really the best solution?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j0iqx0pnfyj3tz", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 3589, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552733678, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1nja2qze53a", "name": "Rohit Lalchandani", "photo": "1484854378_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1nja2qze53a/1484854378_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hv91iivr1r15z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hkkimnphegg1lj", "name": "Nick Rose", "photo": "1488156699_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hkkimnphegg1lj/1488156699_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idkkuxd2dvd6l6", "name": "Niket Kulkarni", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p84g33ch6n7", "name": "Zachary Kirby", "photo": "1504835482_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p84g33ch6n7/1504835482_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i54n88803n659", "name": "Kareena Hirani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "ipkfex1ne3p56y": 1, "j6fe5friemd22w": 1512001996, "jikxm3bf5jw5sl": 1533916392, "jl4dc05mdsj4lr": 1538758484}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkg6f4n8ez3wt", "name": "Mabel", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijmka5drqo5uv", "name": "Ryan Lawler", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idgoli69qus5a3", "name": "Joshua Horowitz", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriloq2jsn4nz", "name": "Ashank Singh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i500ltbfg6B", "name": "Barbara Yang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz4ucrcaakkzg", "name": "Florin-James Langer", "photo": "1454913913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hz4ucrcaakkzg/1454913913_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "h61cxrgqfa11r", "name": "Ryan Kapur", "photo": "1476148505_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/h61cxrgqfa11r/1476148505_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5x7odf43ze772", "name": "Dhanush Patel", "photo": "1503736904_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j5x7odf43ze772/1503736904_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hzd1nja2qze53a", "hkkimnphegg1lj", "idkkuxd2dvd6l6", "is6p84g33ch6n7", "i54n88803n659", "ipkg6f4n8ez3wt", "ijmka5drqo5uv", "idgoli69qus5a3", "idriloq2jsn4nz", "i500ltbfg6B", "hz4ucrcaakkzg", "h61cxrgqfa11r", "iscem14kbsu5vi", "j5x7odf43ze772"], "tags": ["cs", "cs-intended", "eecs", "faculty_advising", "other", "student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 1035}
