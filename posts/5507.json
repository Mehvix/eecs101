In the email it says that I have a time conflict, and that that I can&#39;t get off the waitlist until this conflict is resolved. It tells me to drop the class that I&#39;m enrolled in (61C), and then re enroll and that should trigger the time conflict. However, I&#39;ve done that twice and have not had a time conflict form show up on my dash board, as I get enrolled back in 61C with no problem. So I filled out the eecs time conflict form for ee16a, and am currently waiting on a response. And today, I received the same email titled Enrollment Update: Time conflict.
