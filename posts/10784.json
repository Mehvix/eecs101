I am taking a similar schedule as you right now, except I have 61C and 170 instead of 162 and 170; and I&#39;m finding that these two classes compete with each other for time and that I should have taken them separately. I hear 162 has an even higher workload and is more difficult than 61C, so I would really consider switching one of those for a lighter CS course. 170 doesn&#39;t take as much time per se, but it is a very conceptually challenging class and that might merit more time spent on the problem sets (which are pretty long and difficult) or time spent just rewatching lectures and reading notes. Adding the potentially heaviest project base CS course will make learning the 170 material difficult, I&#39;d say.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-11-11T19:43:28Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 11/10 - 11/16", "bucket_order": 21, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-11-12T08:12:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k2vkv5182cv48j", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I have taken CS162, CS170, and MCB150 and would say that the load is doable especially given that the coursework types complement each other (162 is project based, 170 is weekly psets, and 150 is irregular psets &#43; lots of exam studying).
