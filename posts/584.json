note that the material from Math 53 has almost no projection in to EE16B) or Math 110 (which I believe is upper div linear algebra). \u00a0If however you feel that you need more brush-up on the linear algebra content from 16A, then by all means feel free to go ahead and take Math 54.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "gro4nnkuub", "updated": "2015-10-28T18:14:41Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-10-28T02:13:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["16a", "faculty_advising", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Hi, I&#39;m a freshman EECS major with just a few questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, if we are currently enrolled in EE16A, is it required for us to take EE16B in the Spring of 2016? Or, instead can we choose take our other required classes, such as Physics 7a and Math 53 (Plus CS61B and an AC requirement)?
