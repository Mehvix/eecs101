They are intended to be taken early --- ideally in parallel with CS61A (or Data 8) and CS61B. They build the linear-algebraic and optimization-thinking foundations needed for other courses, most specifically the core ML upper-divs (126, 127, and 189). If they had to be described to someone outside in a nutshell, EE16AB are freshmen-level pre-ML courses that actually hit some of the most important foundational ideas for machine learning. In fact, the combination of EE16A and EE16B contains at least six to seven weeks of material (some would say 10 weeks --- a full quarter-long ML course) that would be standard fare for\u00a0an upper-division ML course elsewhere. (At Berkeley, all this material is just happily assumed so that our machine-learning course can go both deeper and broader.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The only reason that Math 54 is even permitted as an option for some LSCS students is that there are special cases that might require it and it is too much of a hassle to deal with those special cases on a case-by-case basis. By default, all intended LSCS students should be taking EE16A as soon as possible in their schedule. Nobody should think that taking Math 54 is a normal thing to do. It isn&#39;t anymore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The OP&#39;s schedule question is in a sense bizaare because it reflects someone who has already made course selection errors earlier and is now trying to make the best of it. Any incoming freshmen or transfers who are seeing this message should walk away putting EE16AB in their schedules as early as possible. Not thinking about whether it makes sense to take what the OP is considering. This is because EE16AB make everything else easier by building up mental muscles and thought patterns in the right order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-08-08T18:40:59Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jklhbtl2u9d4ja", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-08-03T01:06:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "suggestion_box", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "What are some courses I could pair with 189 that would not be too intense?
