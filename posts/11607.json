I took all lower divs (did p well in them) and currently am taking 170 and math 113. I understand that 162 is very time-consuming but I heard that 176 and sketching algorithms are not being offered in the spring so I wanted to take them. Also, I really enjoy learning about Algorithms and love the material in 170 so I wanted to take more algorithm courses.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For anyone who took these classes, please feel free to give any feedback please!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you in advance :)</p>", "created": "2020-03-31T01:42:13Z", "subject": "CS 162 &#43; CS 176 &#43; CS294-165 schedule", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k8f8knnq7ef15s", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11607, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544256891, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr1fa4dnd9r716", "name": "Katherine Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jz9gltnmf1358i", "name": "Andrew Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jr1fa4dnd9r716", "jz9gltnmf1358i"], "tags": ["student", "suggestion_box", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 273}
