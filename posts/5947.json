Nor Cindy or myself can fix this, unfortunately.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>&#34;There is currently an issue where students are dropped from their discussion or lab, if they perform a discussion or lab change in a\u00a0<b>3 component class set up</b>. The issue occurs if the class is set up in the following format:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Lecture - enrollment component</div>\n<div>Discussion\u00a0<b>and\u00a0</b>lab - non enrollment component</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If the class is set up with lecture, discussion,\u00a0<i>and</i>\u00a0lab, the issue will occur if the student attempts to swap out\u00a0<i>either\u00a0</i>the discussion or the lab (only one).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>Common classes which students experience the issue:</div>\n<div>\n<ul><li><b>ELENG 16A and B</b></li><li><b>COMPSCI 16 B and C</b></li><li><b>ENGIN 7A</b></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Example:</div>\n<div>Enrolled in Lecture 001</div>\n<div>Enrolled in Discussion 101</div>\n<div>Enrolled in Lab 201</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If the student attempts to swap discussion 101 to 102 (lecture and lab is not swapped), the error occurs and student is dropped from the discussion completely (currently enrolled discussion is dropped and newly requested discussion is not added). Student will then only be enrolled in a lecture and lab (incorrectly).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If the student swaps both discussion and lab, the error will not occur.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The issue is being reviewed for a permanent solution.&#34;</div>", "created": "2018-01-08T21:42:22Z", "subject": "CalCentral bug for a few of our classes", "uid": "ibtip4ceues3g0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jc6qghtd8ui56r", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5947, "num_favorites": 5, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550350953, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "enrollments", "instructor-note", "lscs"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 1412}
