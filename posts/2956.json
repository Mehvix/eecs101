I&#39;ve read a lot about AI and have a lot of opinions, but I&#39;m just another undergrad like the rest of us.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At our current level of technology, I personally think it is impossible to say if, when, or how the singularity will occur. I think it would be very risky (if not foolish) to make career choices based on the assumption that we&#39;ll have artificial general intelligence within the next 20 years. That doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t be prepared - we should probably listen to Bostrom, Gates, and Musk&#39;s warning calls.\u00a0<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">This</a>\u00a0is a great summary of the dangers of AI and\u00a0<a href=\"http://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>\u00a0is a great presentation explaining why it might not all be so bad, if you want to read up on it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That being said, one thing we\u00a0<em>do\u00a0</em>know is that we are in a full throttle transition from a product economy to an information economy. This is part of globalization - as it becomes easier and cheaper to move products, people, and information, the average laborer becomes easily replaceable. Innovators, scientists, and engineers become all the more important (as a side note, I think this explains a lot of global political events). I also think AI is just a part of this transition, and who knows where it will take us. I think a universal basic income/techno-communist utopia and Ex Machina/Matrix-esque dystopia are both equally unlikely, but then again, what do I know.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a way, your friend is right. The average coder/software engineer is probably replaceable. We all know making a website or an iOS/Android app isn&#39;t\u00a0<em>that</em> difficult. Then again, if we can replace coders, we can probably replace many low-level positions in the business sector. Suck it haas-hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In another sense, I think your friend is very wrong. In a world with perfect information, product, and labor distribution, we will need people who really understand how the world works in order to create new goods and services. We will need people specifically with STEM degrees to keep pushing the limits of human knowledge and achievement. Admittedly, we&#39;ll probably also still need businessmen and managers to run our companies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I chose to pursue a career in the former because I find it far more interesting and rewarding, but that doesn&#39;t mean business can&#39;t be. Ultimately, if you really enjoy EECS, I see absolutely no reason why you should not pursue it. I think it is a wonderful field with a lot of room for innovation and I&#39;m very excited to be a part of it.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2016-12-31T01:21:58Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-12-30T02:13:46Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Yesterday I asked my Haas friend why he didn&#39;t pursue EECS, even though he loves EECS and it&#39;s his dream career.</p>\n<p><br />&#34;Because&#34;, he said, &#34;in twenty years we&#39;ll have robots that can write 10x more useful code 10x as fast as humans, with 10x fewer bugs&#34;.
