I thought 61b &#43; ee16a was a lot of work. This was a semester in which I was taking 18 units and a very time consuming social sciences class. It was doable but time consuming for me given my lack of previous linear algebra experience. I was taking 61b with Hilfinger which is notoriously difficult. You will find the projects very hard even if you consider yourself a very good programmer because they are designed to really delve into the details of the course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then, I took ee16a with Sahai and found his problem sets a bit long and time consuming for the reasons mentioned before. EE 16b is essentially ee16a in steroids and might be doable or not depending on who teaches it (for example, I found a lot of my time this past semester gravitating towards ee16b because I really didn&#39;t get a lot from Jaijeet&#39;s lectures). That is, if 16b clicks with you, it will be very easy. Otherwise, it will be pretty hard, because it does cover a wide array of things all of which are decently challenging.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, what definitely would be hard is dealing with the ee16b car &#43; the last 61b project. When I took 61b with Hilfinger he made us implement a vcs similar to git (a slightly more simplified version) due at the end of dead week. This project is INCREDIBLY time consuming and particularly hard because of lack of starter code. Then, the ee16b car is due in the last week of classes. If you are on track with the car and no difficulties come up you will have enough time to devote to the 61b project. If that is not the case, you might end up putting countless hours into fixing the car. For me, it had small things that were not working but that made it seem as if everything was wrong so we essentially re-did the whole project in the week it was due</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would recommend you to take 61b with ee16b and data 100. There&#39;s many variables regarding those classes projects that might compromise your time studying for finals. Also, if ee16b is taught as it was taught this semester in the future, the final will be extremely theorical and you would probably want to have a decent amount of time to focus on it. 61b final when I took it was way easier and more fair than the midterms but very unpredictable, so you basically want to hit all topics with a fair amount of time. Physics 7a (from what I&#39;ve heard) is also a test you have to study a decent amount for and data 100 seems to be one of the light-iest workload classes of the department do I&#39;d go with that one if I were you</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2018-05-19T09:29:47Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-17T22:31:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am currently signed up for ee 16b, cs 61b, and physics 7a in the fall semester but am wondering if this workload may be too much as I really want to ensure that I have enough time to do my best in these classes.
