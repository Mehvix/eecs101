On one hand, it introduces a lot of different machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, it talks about some statistical inference (MLE, MAP) and a bit of optimization, a bit of information theory, a bit of learning theory, etc. The main ideas you take away from the course are the various methods, a sense of how to use them (how to program them), and various motivations for why they were created.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE 127 can be summarized as: a review of linear algebra (you may not have seen all of this stuff before: norms, dual norms,\u00a0SVD), knowledge of common convex models (and how to program them), and some techniques for taking a generic optimization problem and manipulating it into a convex problem. (Generally speaking, convex problems are tractable and non-convex problems are not; there are exceptions.)
