I have a few questions and it&#39;d be nice to get anyone&#39;s feedback.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For those who have done well in CS70(gotten A- or higher), how did you prepare for the class or what did you do that made you really successful? What were you&#39;re &#34;mathematical maturity&#34;level\u00a0and what classes did you take previously(AP/IB classes, community )?

It&#39;s an upper division class for a lower division class.

In other words, did anyone take EE16A, then EE16B a year later? How was your experience doing this? I&#39;m considering this to focus on declaring cs, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll feel completely lost in EE16B, since the circuits unit from 16A continue on to 16B.</p>", "created": "2018-08-29T20:31:02Z", "subject": "Questions regarding GPA Cutoff for Lower Division Classes", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jlfli8zzu5q5v5", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7563, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548677862, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["16a", "cs-intended", "lscs", "other", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 503}
