I filled out the form to appeal my grade on June 17, but haven&#39;t received a response yet.\n\nHere is a copy of my response for your convenience:\n\nFirst of all in Spring 2021 CS 70, there were Zoom issues related to exams. Fifteen minutes into the exam, Zoom crashed on everyone. Therefore, everyone was given an extra 5 minutes, but most students didn&#39;t know about it since they thought they weren&#39;t allowed to check Piazza or email. If they know about it, they could have finished more problems on the exam. Just hours before the final exam, a TA (Megan) posted on Piazza to record themselves by creating their own Zoom links instead of the provided ones. Those Zoom issues caused unnecessary stress on students and I don&#39;t see any action taken by professors or course staff grade wise.\n\nSecond, during this difficult time, I wished that staff would be more lenient on grading. But they only have three hw drops, three vitamin drops, one midterm, and one final to compensate on this. Also, towards the end, some of the lectures were rushed and one topic (continuous probability) was emphasized less than previous semesters. They also introduced a new topic which wasn&#39;t covered in the previous semester. These actions may have lowered students&#39; exam scores. While I agree that a professor cannot change a student&#39;s grade based on individual circumstances, everyone faced challenges durinf this pandemic. I understand that different classes have different grading policies, however in CS 70, the course staff didn&#39;t do much to adjust grading other than z-score grading on exams. Many students were on the border of declaring. For example, one student got a B instead of a B&#43;, which is needed to declare as a CS major. For mu case, I thought I was on the border to get an A- based on what students who took the class before said. But according to professor Rao, I am far away from the border. This indicates that the class may have been graded harsher than before, which is not fair because all students including international and DSP students faced a lot of struggles to adapt with remote learning. It is possible that my final exam z-score may have dropped because of regrades on the final exam which could put me at an overall grade of B&#43;.\n\nThird, professor Rao said that they need to read the notes closely to understand the material well. But in the midst of remote learning, it is difficult to keep up due to responsibilities that students may have to face whether from their families or loved ones during the pandemic. As a result, I do not believe that the professor is understanding the situation of all studt, especially when international students live in countries that are hit hard due to skyrocketing COVID-19 cases.\n\nThus, I respectfully ask course staff to reconsider grades and take into account the circumstances that all students faced, and release grading bins for the class do that students ensure that their grades are calculated correctly and assigned fairly.
