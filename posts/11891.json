The EECS/CS degrees and the DS degree aren&#39;t really that different in terms of classes that could potentially fulfill both majors, and with EECS you have a greater chance of getting into the CS classes DS majors would also use for their own degree requirements. I&#39;m not sure declaring DS would help you get into any classes for which you don&#39;t already have enrollment priority, so why not just take those courses if you are interested? It may be nice to have EECS&#43;DS in your degree, but is it worth having to take all of the L&amp;S breadths just for that? If you simply did the DS minor, you might be able to take all of the DS-related classes you wouldn&#39;t have taken as an EECS major, and you wouldn&#39;t have to do any L&amp;S college requirements, which saves you at least a couple semesters worth of classes...
