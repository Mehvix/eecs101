Many people will tell you that GPA doesn&#39;t matter, and that a Berkeley CS degree will get you all sorts of good industry jobs in the Bay regardless of the grades you earned. If you&#39;re interested in software engineering and that&#39;s what you want to do then I would say go ahead and explore these harder classes since I found that this is generally true in this time and day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you how I view this kind of thing though personally. I like to try to keep my doors open for as long as possible. And while having a bad GPA won&#39;t even come close to ruining your life, the truth is that a good GPA is important for many pursuits. Not caring about your GPA closes your doors to many opportunities, namely graduate school programs. I assume that as a rising sophomore, you&#39;re still only getting an idea of what you want to do in your career. Hopefully you don&#39;t find that you want to pursue a master&#39;s or doctorate degree later in your undergraduate career and regret that you had a bad GPA. It is not foolish in my opinion to strategically choose classes to keep your GPA above water.</p>", "created": "2018-06-08T07:30:55Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "ji5nj5sxnv43yx", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4d4n5av41k", "name": "Yunzhi Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jg6lw88k7nv447", "name": "Mark Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6levisx8i724b", "name": "Kyle John Khus", "photo": "1535837231_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6levisx8i724b/1535837231_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6v3ubkv5p6", "name": "Alex Yeo", "photo": "1551120700_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6v3ubkv5p6/1551120700_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewtq63xs2y4", "name": "Daniel Gultom", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6nu4d4n5av41k", "jg6lw88k7nv447", "j6levisx8i724b", "is6p6v3ubkv5p6", "j6lewtq63xs2y4"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-08T05:58:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi, I&#39;m a rising sophomore, intended CS, maybe declaring by next semester.
