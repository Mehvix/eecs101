Thus, I was thinking to first enroll in 16b, and then enroll in 162 (all in phase 1). However, I will be a junior in the fall, and it appears that even if there are open seats in 16b during my phase 1, I will automatically be put on the waitlist. Thus, if I continue to add 162 in phase 1, I&#39;m thinking the scheduler won&#39;t allow me to get into 16b even off the waitlist? Is there someone I should email to be able to allow this conflict?
