The projects do take time and especially when midterms and deadlines start to overlap it will become tough. But, the most important thing is to have a good 162 group and you all communicate with each other and have the same priorities. My entire group was taking both 161 and 162 so we basically had the same schedule and were able to plan things out in advance. I think both classes are definitely doable and complement each other nicely. Also, I would not worry about 195 at all.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-04-13T21:46:22Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k8z0b9vm6ob2g4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11593": 6, "11740": 9, "1521": 8, "2004": 2, "3816": 3, "3852": 7, "8589": 4, "9188": 1, "9311": 5, "9841": 0}}, "created": "2020-04-13T20:40:02Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "eecs", "enrollments", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Hello,\n\nHow do you find the following schedule?\n\n- CS 162 (with John Kubiatowicz)\n- CS 161 (with Weaver)\n- Atro C10 (Into to General Astronomy with Alexander Philipenko)\n- CS 195 (Social Implications of Computer Technology with Josh Hug)\n\nAny thoughts/comments?
