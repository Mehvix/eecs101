If you are interested please fill out the form <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Qq4ZH6ZbVpcxavb47\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>here</u></a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><u>Overview:</u></b>\u00a0The study consists of\u00a0<b>15 minutes</b>\u00a0of pair programming with a randomly assigned partner where you will work together on python questions; then\u00a0<b>10 minutes</b>\u00a0of solo programming; followed by another\u00a0<b>15 minutes</b>\u00a0of pair programming with another randomly assigned partner. You will fill out short surveys (<b>5-8 minutes</b>) answering questions about your experience in programming sessions and your feedback about practicing pair programming. You will get detailed solutions to all programming questions and a\u00a0<b>$15 Amazon gift card</b>\u00a0at the end of the study.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><u>Why you should join:</u></b></p>\n<ul><li>\n<p><b>The study is done fully remote</b>\u00a0(instructions will be given over zoom and the programming sessions will use a web-app specifically built for this study, so you can join the study from anywhere #programminginpajamas)</p>\n</li><li>\n<p><b>The study is anonymous</b>\u00a0(you will be paired with 2 randomly assigned partners in each paired session without audio or video except a chat window to communicate with your partner and a shared code editor, so partner identities will be fully hidden for all participants #mysterypartners)</p>\n</li><li>\n<p><b>The scheduling is flexible</b>\u00a0(with enough students, we will be able to group students by their availabilities and run the study in multiple days/times, we will contact you with a proposed date/time you can join the study. Feel free to indicate any date preferences such as &#34;after March 7th&#34; or &#34;Tu 3-4pm except March 8th&#34; etc. We will do our best to make it work! #justfillouttheform)</p>\n</li><li>\n<p><b>The study is multinational</b>\u00a0(the study is conducted in the University of Seville in Spain using javascript and with your participation we will be able to run the Berkeley version in python and see pair programming interactions in different countries/cultures! #thatscool)</p>\n</li></ul>\n<p>You can see this on flyers around Soda Hall labs and Wozniak Lounge as well. Join and get a $15 Amazon gift card while practicing python skills in a no-pressure setting.
