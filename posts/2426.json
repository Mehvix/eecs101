Last semester I took 70, 61b, and 16b, and I thought that was tough but this is definitely worse. 120 and 170 are both theory classes, so there is very little programming/projects in both, mainly problem sets. The 120 problem sets usually end up taking me\u00a02-3\u00a0days to finish, same with 170. Most of the material so far has been about variants of the fourier transform, so if you understood the DFT material in 16ab pretty well, that should help, but 120 doesn&#39;t use the linear algebra approach. Outside of class, I end up having to go to office hours, but I don&#39;t really spend much extra time studying besides homework.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2016-10-23T07:09:20Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-24T21:27:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Prerequisites can be found here:\u00a0http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/el_eng/</p>", "created": "2016-10-24T21:27:50Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ibtip4ceues3g0"}], "id": "iuokr4tifdgjf", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-23T01:16:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "cs", "other", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>First Question: Are there any pre-requisites to taking EE106A and then 106B (the robotics courses). I can&#39;t seem to find much if at all, any, information about these courses online. To people who have had experience with these courses, do you think there are some classes that should definitely be taken prior to these courses? Also, what is the workload like in these courses? And did you find them to be actually useful?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second Question: I&#39;ve been hearing that EE126 and EE127 are good prerequisites for CS189, but I had never heard of this before. I&#39;d only heard that taking CS188 would be good, but not even that is a pre-requisite. Are EE126 and/or EE127 useful for CS189?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third Question:\u00a0Would it be doable to take Physics 7B, CS170, and EE120 at the same time, likely with a humanities course? I understand that CS170 is an\u00a0extremely time consuming course, but I don&#39;t know much about EE120. Also, 170 and 120 seem to be both theory heavy courses, so I&#39;m unsure if that is a wise decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "created": "2016-10-23T01:16:52Z", "subject": "Info Regarding EE106A/B and CS189 and class selection", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "iuly1yrzaz65l4", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 2426, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654554369648, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "eecs", "faculty_advising", "other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 261}
