I took 134 with 70 on a whim and kinda regret it. My gripes against 134 were\n\n1) I did not like the Pitman textbook, and Lucas&#39;s lectures weren&#39;t that great imo either. In the parts of 70 and 134 that overlapped, I actually thought the 70 notes did a better job of teaching the material. The general quality of learning materials was lower than what I&#39;ve seen in eecs department classes. (Probably doesn&#39;t apply to 140 though.)\n\n2) The class wasn&#39;t as challenging as I had hoped, material-wise. All the quizzes/exams were straightforward applications of the material. The only exception to this were some of the homework problems (which were all straight out of the textbook), but homework was graded on 75% completion, so you&#39;d need a ton of internal motivation to challenge yourself with it. I wasn&#39;t super self-motivated that semester, and I fell into the pattern of just cramming the material the day before a quiz. It worked for me grade-wise, but wasn&#39;t optimal learning-wise.\n\n3) If you&#39;ve already taken 70 and understood the material pretty well, 134 will be redundant. 70 covers at least half of the material in 134; 134 just spends a lot more time on continuous probability and introduces some common distributions.\n\n134 isn&#39;t a bad class by any means - it&#39;s just that 126 (and maybe 140, not too sure about it) is better. I still learned a lot about probability, but looking at 126 homeworks, you learn a whole bunch of tricks, twists, turns, and conceptual background that 134 never touched on. Even though 134/126 is redundant at parts, I&#39;ll probably still take 126 eventually. It goes a good bit further than 134 anyways.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-10-10T06:12:48Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-09T23:50:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello! I am a Data Science student who wants to take 189 (either next summer or fall 2020). I was wondering if I should take EECS 126, STAT 140 or STAT134 next semester.
