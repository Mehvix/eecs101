Last semester, I was enrolled in Sahai&#39;s 16B against my will. I was told by the administration that if I did not take the class in Fall, I would not be guaranteed admission as a Senior and therefore could jeopardize my ability to graduate on time. 16B was easily the worst &#39;educational&#39; experience I have had in my 20 years on this earth, and it tanked my GPA and will make it incredibly difficult for me to get into graduate schools.</p>\n<p><br />Now I&#39;m being told that 16B is being dropped as a requirement. I feel so betrayed by the school. You guys pointed a gun to my head and said I had to take it. That was plainly untrue. Heck, if this change occurred mid-semester in Fall, I would have taken an INC (which is removable via petition to the Office of the Registrar), but that was not presented as a valid option at the time. I am being penalized for doing this by the book. It seems it would have been wiser for me to ignore the advise of the administration, which is just an absurd catch-22 if I&#39;ve ever seen one. If the new requirements are approved, is there a mechanism in place to remove the course from my transcript?</p>", "created": "2022-04-17T19:29:41Z", "subject": "Petition to Remove EECS 16B From Transcript", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am a 3rd year undergraduate CS major and DS minor.
