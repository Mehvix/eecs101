I know someone that had a lot of experience with math in high school and found CS70 pretty easy with homework taking less than an hour for him each week. Other people (like me) spent many many hours figuring out the material and doing the homework. Are you experienced with proof-writing? Did you do contest math in high school (AMC, AIME, USAMO), that kinda stuff? If so, you&#39;ll probably be totally fine. Otherwise, it can be pretty challenging and time-consuming. Main advice is, don&#39;t give up or feel discouraged if you&#39;re lost/struggling. Persistence is important, keep thinking about whatever you&#39;re stuck on and after a good while go ask people (TAs, tutors, professor office hours) for help. Find friends to work together and discuss with (but don&#39;t rely on them completely).
