I would HIGHLY recommend taking 70 along with a general education requirement as the class moves fast and doesn&#39;t go too deep into discrete mathematics compared to the semester. Also, the curve is MUCH more lenient compared to the semester because of the smaller class size. 10/10 would do it again.<br />---<br />I took CS70 over Summer &#39;18 with another 3-unit tech in a different field. I absolutely loved the course and thought there was plenty of time to learn the material with 7 units total--taking it alone will let you dedicate more than enough time to the pretty lengthy homeworks and studying for tests. The course staff over the summer were fantastic and there was plenty of support to go along with the slightly faster pace. I was able to take CS170 in the Fall (did well, 70 was good prep btw) and it really helped with overall scheduling, 8/8 would recommend. I think we learned the material just as well as we would have in a normal semester, if not better.</p>", "created": "2019-01-02T12:29:33Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I did CS70 along with CS188 and another session A humanities course last summer and it was doable - definitely a far more challenging course than most because it is math that most of us are not used to.
