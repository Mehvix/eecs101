As of July 18th when a student receives time conflict error message, a notification is generated and surfaces on their CalCentral dashboard. Students then use the message to request a Time Conflict override. If no other restrictions prevent students from enrolling in both classes (such as exceeding Phase unit limits, closed class, etc) the time conflict restriction will be waived and their enrollment will be processed. For more information about the enrollment time conflict process, please see -\u00a0<a href=\"http://sis.berkeley.edu/time-conflict\" target=\"_blank\">http://sis.berkeley.edu/time-conflict</a></div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Please advise if you have any additional questions.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Let me know if there are follow up questions.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Thanks,</div>\n<div>Sarah</div>", "created": "2016-07-28T22:30:36Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>It should have popped up when you tried to register, but I am hearing reports that it might not be there anymore.
