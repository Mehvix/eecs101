After 24, please log in to your CalCentral to see if there is a notification.</p>\n<p>- The only reason an override form would NOT be processed overnight is if there are other conflicts. Examples of other conflicts include: the class is full, you have reached your unit cap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Right now, SIS does not notify you if you have one or more of these conflicts. They are aware that this is a problem. They have been trying to manually review these conflicts to notify students of the reason why they weren&#39;t enrolled, but at this time they are completely backlogged on tickets.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br />Advice for you:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- If you submitted a ticket, please do not submit another one. Instead, if you have additional comments or questions, please reply to the confirmation email you got. This will help SIS respond to you more quickly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- If you were not enrolled overnight, please check to make sure that the course/section is open and that you have not reached your unit cap. As a reminder: the unit cap is a hard 10.5 in phase 1 and a hard 16 in phase 2. This includes waitlisted units.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There have been lots of questions about how to address frustrations with the new system.
