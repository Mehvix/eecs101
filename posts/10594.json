Some more:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-184 isn&#39;t as bad as 162 in project workload. However, I absolutely loved that class. Easily one of my favorites here. Plus so aesthetically pleasing</p>\n<p>-161 is another one of my favorites. Prob could be viewed as a starter upper div in terms of workload (same boat as 188, 186). I&#39;d say this class is incredibly useful if you are going to be programming at all after graduating. If you are looking pure CS theory or pure math-y CS or aiming for grad school, maybe less so. However, if you are going to grad school, you wont have the chance to take this later since you will have to start specializing</p>\n<p>-Adding on to the comment below about 159, that course isn&#39;t too bad. Maybe not the best starter upper div, but not comparable to 189 in the slightest. They go both into the theory and application, with a decent amount of jupyter programming assignments and such.</p>\n<p>-182 is fairly new so idk too much about it, but would def be easier than 189. I also don&#39;t know how useful it is unless you are going machine learning or are just interested. Classes like info 159 and such that teach aspects of machine learning that rely on these deep NNs also teach that. If you are looking for grad school in ML, where you would be taking a bunch more courses in ML, it would probably be more useful. Kinda like how if you take 170 early on, you already know a lot of the algorithms or approaches for algorithms in other classes like 186, 188, etc</p>\n<p>-I know nothing about that 294. Could be cool if you get in. I probably wouldn&#39;t prioritize a grad class your last semester unless it is directly and extremely applicable to what you wanna do or you are really interested in it. If you are going to grad school, they wont see this class on your transcripts, so it wont matter, and you could just take the course in grad school.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR: all have their own pros and cons. Assuming you&#39;re looking at ML grad school, I&#39;d prob aim for:</p>\n<p>-184 (Makes computer vision an easier path if you choose that way)</p>\n<p>-182 (Makes all ML paths easier)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are really into NLP, maybe info 159 over 184.
