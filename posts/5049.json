I was wondering if there were any CS student organizations that were welcoming toward new CS students (as in students with no previous CS experience.) \n\nMaybe it&#39;s too late for this semester (let me know if it isn&#39;t though!), but I&#39;m looking for a CS student organization that I can learn new things from, work on projects with, and form a community/ second family with. I wish to get more exposure to the CS field, but it seems paradoxical that I need experience to get experience even to just join a club.\n\nI&#39;ve tried applying to things like Mobile Developers and Blueprint, but I was unable to get in because of my lack of CS experience. \n\nI am a part of CSUA, but the organization is so big that it really doesn&#39;t feel like I am part of the organization. It doesn&#39;t host meetings regularly and just hosts events that anyone can attend. \n\nDo you guys know of any CS student organizations that would fit this criteria?\n\nThanks!", "created": "2017-09-27T21:21:10Z", "subject": "CS Student Organizations that welcome beginners", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j83jchqzbr02a", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5049, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654551277996, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p759ji5o5ws", "name": "Vera Wang", "photo": "1529996635_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p759ji5o5ws/1529996635_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "name": "Logan Howard", "photo": "1471912865_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hccnzx9ezt97j7/1471912865_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isakqfi08sa7ao", "name": "Matthew Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p759ji5o5ws", "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "isakqfi08sa7ao"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "other", "peer_directed", "student", "tutoring"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 345}
