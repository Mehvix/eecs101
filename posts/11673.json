I don&#39;t know whether I want to do grad school but I want to maintain a high gpa to keep that option available. Should I just take\u00a0all classes as PNP, and maybe retake some of them as letter grade in the future? Should I letter grade and take the B/B&#43;&#39;s? I really don&#39;t know what to do, especially I heard the professor of a certain class\u00a0subtly advise against PNP.</p>", "created": "2020-04-05T01:39:17Z", "subject": "I want to PNP but my classes are too important...", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k8mdo4qj1veyo", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11673, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544183283, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "name": "Zaynah Javed", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1548797126, "jkjt85cc6fc4jx": 1541740603, "jko89qm4qo732a": 1543432634, "jqr7hfmf4v74e": 1552945044, "jr6wgkg4hqh19q": 1548796612}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhrzrklubu41ah", "name": "Hamza Qadeer", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewvq3r8h2z2", "name": "Drew Kaul", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "jhrzrklubu41ah", "j6lewvq3r8h2z2"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 718}
