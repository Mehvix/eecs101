The linalg in 189 is pretty much about calculation and proof\u00a0by calculation.

My experience with 110 was probably different to most as I took it with Prof Holtz, who most would agree teaches the class very differently to others to the point where past midterms and finals were of no use for studying. I have not taken any class with Frenkel so I can&#39;t speak to this offering of 110 in particular. The class (with Holtz) is not computational at all but rather abstract to the point where we didn&#39;t even talk about topics like traces or determinants. Having taken 189 and 127, I found there to be barely any overlap other than some talk about real symmetric matrices (which was hardly talked about in 189) - 110 did not help with 127/189 or the other way around. As such I think the class (with this professor in particular) has a lot of content that you likely would not have studied. That said, I don&#39;t know how useful it would be for you - it depends on your background and whether you&#39;re interested in more theoretical/abstract topics. If you want a more rigorous/less computational study of linear algebra and an introduction to more abstract notions in linear algebra (but you don&#39;t want to take H110 or are not sure about taking 113) then taking Holtz&#39;s version of the course could be a good idea (from a learning perspective). The textbook used was Linear Algebra Done Right, so I&#39;d imagine that other versions of 110 using this textbook might be similarly taught.", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "name": "Owen Bai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6nu3l1tkcr3k5"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-08-23T19:27:44Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-21T05:01:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Does it make sense to take Math 110 with Frenkel after taking 189 and understanding the material pretty well?
