I have no internship experience and worked on a personal project (although I didn&#39;t come that close to finishing it) last summer. I&#39;m currently taking CS 61C, and due to its difficulty and fast pace I haven&#39;t had any time to work on a project this summer. I&#39;m planning on applying for summer 2019 internships, but I&#39;m worried that my lack of project and internship experience, despite my pretty good GPA, will cause me to not get much attention from companies (as was the case for summer 2018 internships). For people who&#39;ve been in this boat before and know people who&#39;ve been in this position, should I be very concerned about my internship prospects and, if so, what can I do to improve my chances of getting an internship?
