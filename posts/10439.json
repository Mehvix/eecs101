It would be terrible if the due dates are the same for both classes as you will have to split your time and <em>really\u00a0</em>stay on top of everything. Again I took CS61B with Professor Hug, but CS61B will also require a lot of time as the concepts are super important and require time to understand them. CS61B will be a heavy class in terms of workload as you will have labs, hw, and projects. As far as difficulty is concerned, that varys from student to student. I personally found it easy, however I know a lot of students who thought otherwise. I also took it with Professor Hug, who usually offers more &#34;scaffolding&#34; on assignments where as Professor Hilfinger is known to offer less scaffolding. So that is also something to consider as you will be spending\u00a0<em>a lot more time</em>\u00a0on projects. If these deadlines are on the same day as EE16B and CS70 that would be death. That is not to say that it isn&#39;t &#34;doable&#34;. That answer really depends on you. It is helpful to have other friends who are in the same boat but at the end of the day it is your decision.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-10-17T17:12:52Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "k1uyq2f32db6i4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/13 - 10/19", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/13 - 10/19", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-18T05:13:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k1vog87af772qi", "subject": "<p>did this combo as well and agree with ^</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2019-10-18T05:13:03Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-18T05:01:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k1vo1xrjuas4r2", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I&#39;m going to give a different outlook.
