Your &#34;weekly&#34; work will consist of reading ~2-3 papers per class and writing a short reflection/summary per paper. If you don&#39;t have experience reading research papers, this will take you some time to digest the information, so do not be surprised if you spend several hours a week reading the papers. Other than that the main goal of the class is to perform research throughout the semester and submit a final conference style paper and deliver a presentation. It is up to you how you spend your time over the semester, but you should definitely not leave the project until the very end. Taking grad courses as an undegrad is a great experience, but I would not treat it as a class that you can put off, simply because you have other priorities, i.e. midterms, projects, problem sets.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-05-26T18:39:45Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "kao9kw9yp3m731", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3whkntj3rg", "name": "William Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhk3wp5qvi71bv": 1533542488, "jz2c8op4xqq4z3": 1570518768}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6m3yw7hjf92b4", "name": "Kevin Svetlitski", "photo": "1579650374_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6m3yw7hjf92b4/1579650374_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j4i5gu5n66420l", "name": "Neil Kulkarni", "photo": "1568090726_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j4i5gu5n66420l/1568090726_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6nu3whkntj3rg", "j6m3yw7hjf92b4", "j4i5gu5n66420l"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11636": 1, "3903": 8, "4113": 0, "4464": 5, "5181": 6, "6284": 7, "7112": 4, "7921": 2, "8921": 9, "9218": 3}}, "created": "2020-05-26T18:19:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<md>I'm presently enrolled in CS262A for next semester, and wanted to ask if anyone here has taken it and can comment on the workload.
