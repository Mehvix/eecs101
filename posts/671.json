I was wondering if someone could redirect me to someone I could contact about this. It seems like the servers in Cory are down, so we are not able to use any software that requires a licensing server (for example HSPICE). We are not able to print in the labs as well. The printing isn&#39;t really a problem for us but we really need to be able to use HSPICE for our lab, and I heard that this server problem is affecting other classes as well. Is there anyone we can contact to check if this is an acknowledged issue?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2015-12-07T19:35:39Z", "subject": "Cory servers are down?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "ihwcyk8zbux551", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 671, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654556076909, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 199}
