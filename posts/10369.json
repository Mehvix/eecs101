I have also taken a Linear Algebra course over at another college institution (but not specifically a transferrable Math 54 credit as it did not cover differential equations). Therefore, I have a solid foundation in the concepts of linear algebra - which goes over the first module of the EE16a curriculum. I have heard of options such as EECS 47D (completion of EE16a) to essentially skip over the linear algebra portion part of the course and learn strictly the circuit modules.
