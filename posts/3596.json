Appcruit offers many advantages that you would not received when applying directly through a company&#39;s website.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, when you apply through Appcruit, an Appcruit Talent Specialist reviews your resume before an employer see&#39;s it. This is great given Appcruit can catch any errors and chat with you about updates to your resume if necessary. We are all about making sure you put your best foot forward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, applying through Appcruit ensures that your resume is reviewed and allows you to bypass thousands of applicants who apply through the normal application process. This makes a candidate who applies through Appcruit more likely to receive an interview.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third, the access you get to employers is all virtual. Imagine hearing from employers about their companies or having a Q&amp;A with companies virtually. This all ties together the product and reimagines the way employers recruit college talent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope this answered your question.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "ixux12ihhvw39r", "updated": "2017-03-23T05:39:05Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/19 - 3/25", "bucket_order": 199, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-23T06:39:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j0m12cp56vu2aj", "subject": "<p>Awesome thanks for your answer!
