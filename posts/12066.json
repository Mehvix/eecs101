What I&#39;ve seen in 61a is they give the MS students a 10 hour TA job and they usually don&#39;t teach, they do Head TA jobs (so backend stuff you usually need experience with the class to know). Just a guess though. As for out of state, I&#39;m in a bit of a fight with the registrar about this. I&#39;m guessing you will have lived here for four years like I have and logically that should be enough in my opinion (I&#39;ve been paying taxes to the state of CA for two years), but this is the website you need to know (<a href=\"https://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/residency-tuition-purposes/in-state-tuition-graduate-students\">https://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/residency-tuition-purposes/in-state-tuition-graduate-students</a>). It&#39;s highly deceitful though. If you are out of state and already effectively living in CA, what does it mean to &#34;move&#34; to the state? Not particularly clear. If you read the 30 page PDF linked, not particularly clear. May cost me $7k. Don&#39;t make my mistake, if you read the PDF it says you need to get a driver&#39;s license and register to vote 1 year prior to the 5th Yr Master&#39;s program. So do it by this fall if possible.
