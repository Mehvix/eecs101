It definitely combines coding and math, namely stat stuff and leaning towards machine learning. The prereqs are CS61b, linear algebra, and cs c8, but if you put in a request on their website you can sign up without the prereqs all met. CS C8 is basically cs61a plus intro stats, but c100 teaches all the same material and more, so you should be fine hopefully.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EECS 126 might also be a good alternative. Since you&#39;re taking 127, I&#39;m assuming you have some ML interest (plus you mentioned liking DS/analytics), but regardless much of the math that EECS is built on is 126/127 (maybe through in 120 for signals/systems and some circuit class like 105). This class does require CS70, but since you&#39;ve taken 188 you should have already met that requirement. The weekly problem sets do require time though (moreso than c100), so take that into account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Either of the above classes would be core for a data science career.</p>", "created": "2019-04-27T03:36:41Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "juyye2qyhqv56x", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/21 - 4/27", "bucket_order": 48, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/21 - 4/27", "bucket_order": 48, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-28T00:05:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jv06a6dimw46y1", "subject": "<p>\u00a0Cool! So yeah, you prob don&#39;t wanna take 126 then. I&#39;d take 189 eventually, but you got time. I&#39;m also assuming you&#39;ve taken Math 53, which is somewhat needed for this stuff (namely partial derivatives). CS 170 will give you the algorithmic base that will help you wherever in CS you end up, so I&#39;d recommend that. Math 110 can also prove useful in building a solid linear algebra foundation, which could be useful. There aren&#39;t any lower div CS courses I&#39;d say are really crucial to this field that you haven&#39;t already taken or are planning on taking. EE 120 could be useful possibly. Internet says signal processing stuff like 120 and 123 have ML/data science applications (from a quick google search), although I&#39;m unsure of the details. You also might find Math 128A (numerical analysis) interesting.
