I think the students in Cal&#39;s EECS program could do a lot with knowing exactly <em>why</em> our program is good--right now students (me included) really only have a vague idea that we have a good CS program, but not what makes it good. I think that\u00a0having\u00a0some more visible publicity--not for the sake of ego boosting (for we all know EECS students don&#39;t need any more of that), but for the sake of broadcasting the many opportunities available at Berkeley--could do some good.
