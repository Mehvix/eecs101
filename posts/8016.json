It took longer because of debugging and not understanding how the built in methods and classes would help in completing the project. Project 3 took me 30&#43; hours because of debugging(I couldn&#39;t find my bugs), and the concepts were difficult to implement in code(Used all 3 slip days). There was very little instructions on what to do, and staff has mentioned they will change this for future iterations of the course.
