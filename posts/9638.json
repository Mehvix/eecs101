They indeed help. Ask someone (TA or Prof Hug maybe?) to get the skeleton code and\u00a0use the public autograder\u00a0linked below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, don&#39;t be discouraged by the grade. CS61A is indeed a tough course. And whether or not you should\u00a0do CS should not just depend on\u00a0a grade from an introductory class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here&#39;s what I did for CS61A over summer to ensure I\u00a0could declare CS:</p>\n<p>1. Watched every lecture, then\u00a0did the corresponding labs and HWs (but not projects)</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Did one or two practice exams (Yes, that helps)</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Learned everything again during the regular school year (try not to look at your answers written in summer)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reflections:</p>\n<p>1. Because of the extra time I spent on the course in advance, I got to REALLY know the material. And yes, I did learn a lot even when taking the course &#34;again&#34; during the regular school year. IMO, you need multiple exposures\u00a0to master some tricky materials.</p>\n<p>2. I only studied materials up to before MT2 during summer, and there is some noticeable difference\u00a0between my level of understanding of pre-mt2 and post-mt2 material in the fall. So I think\u00a0my approach indeed helped.</p>\n<p>3. I think spending more time during the regular school year should achieve a similar result. But as Berkeley students, we usually don&#39;t have that &#34;more time&#34;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is also applicable for 61B. Some notes:</p>\n<p>1. You may need to ask someone to get the skeleton codes but there&#39;s a public autograder available\u00a0<a href=\"https://sp18.datastructur.es/\">https://sp18.datastructur.es/</a>\u00a0(Should show up\u00a0under\u00a0Summer 2018 tab)</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0I think reading the textbook without writing any code won&#39;t work, at least for a hands-on course like Hilfinger&#39;s 61B.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0I lab assisted 61B this semester and I would say learning the material of 61B again indeed deepened my understanding. Given the importance of 61B, I should probably use the same approach.</p>\n<p>4. Of course, this is probably not the most efficient way to prepare but since it\u00a0should work, you may try it for meeting the GPA cutoff.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "j6l0q8u46ag7a4", "updated": "2019-05-21T03:19:30Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/19 - 5/25", "bucket_order": 45, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-21T22:29:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jvydfu8enzs3ox", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>B&#43; in 61a is really good!
