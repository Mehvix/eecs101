However, even though CalCentral will allow enrollment into both classes, it is still the student\u2019s responsibility to plan their schedule carefully. Departments and faculty are NOT required or expected to accommodate students\u2019 schedule conflicts, and the Instructor of Record may decline to enroll or Instructor Drop a student from a class if they cannot be present for all schedule activities, including midterms and finals. Best practice is to speak to the instructors before enrolling in time conflicted classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, this list is intended to help crowd-source information, saving students, staff, &amp; faculty emails regarding webcasting.
