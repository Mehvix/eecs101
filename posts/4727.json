Just finished my first year.\u00a0Right off the bat, I want to tell you this... don&#39;t ever be discouraged by this or anything else in life that comes at you. In fact, taking EE16A &#43; CS61A over the summer is hard for any first year student here at Berkeley. Especially since 61A is so project heavy. So don&#39;t let these courses define you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can&#39;t necessarily give you tips on the direction you should take in regards to your application. I believe that&#39;s either up to you and/or admission officers insight. But I can tell you this:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>About 3 years ago, I graduated HS with terrible grades. Getting straight C&#39;s exiting my senior year. 1500/2400 SAT (took it twice). No college acceptances. Only place that would take my hand was community college. During this time, it was was one of the most awkward times with my parents. My parents were not proud, they were not happy. And they did their job in reminding me that constantly. So I completely understand your feelings about telling your\u00a0parents. But I stayed calm, I was patient, and I learned from my mistakes. I told my parents and myself... I&#39;ll make you proud. I will fix this. Just give me two years, I promise. Two years later, I applied to an ivy league school, numerous UC&#39;s, and some privates. I got into nearly all of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What I want to say from all of this, is that it doesn&#39;t end here. You should not give up on your goals. You should go straight to your CC counselor you trust, lay out your whole situation with complete honesty, and make a 2 year plan right away. Just straight up hustle. You haven&#39;t even started CC yet, you have a long way to go. And you can have an amazing 2 year CC record to make up for 2 bad grades here at Berkeley.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And to end this. Man, your last sentence really hit me deep. Just trust yourself on that. You will turn yourself around. Odds were against me. How in the world would someone like me get into Berkeley or an IVY league?Don&#39;t just tell your parents, show them. Give them a timeline and prove it. I believe in you man.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Remember that no matter what your parents say to you, they say it because they love you. The heart doesn&#39;t speak in one language.</strong>\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-13T19:24:38Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "j6b4dauavonsr", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse":

Work hard on your application and show those application to Cal instructors, maybe your TA, hopefully they could help you. \n\nAnother thing I want to mention is that, you do not have to get into EECS or CS at L&amp;S.  You can apply for applied math, stat or any kind of major at L&amp;S. Then declare major to CS at L&amp;S.  I know some people take advantage of this system because AM and STAT have higher accept rates. \n\nHere is the link to check it: <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major\">https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major</a>\n\nBasically, my suggestion is Get into a higher accept rate major in L&amp;S then declare to CS.  \nBut remember, Cal&#39;s classes are super challenge,  I believe 61A and 16A are their basic level.

This is, as many have adequately explained, because of the density and depth of\u00a0what is covered in each college course; more material is covered per week than in high-school/AP classes (and even more so in the summer), and the content is also covered in more detail and with higher rigor. So now take your experience from the summer, reflect on it, and make a plan with a set of goals. Seek advice, they are really valuable. Surround yourself with support that starts from yourself, but keep yourself in check without being too hard on yourself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I guarantee you that there will be plenty of opportunities to prove, both to yourself and to others, that you learned from this experience.
