The lectures are supplemented with homeworks and experimental work in the laboratory using several Baxter, Sawyer, and TurtleBot robots. There will be one midterm and no final exam. The last four weeks of the class will be dedicated to a final project that students will complete in teams of 3-5. Lectures those last four weeks will consist of special topics and guest lectures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For prerequisites, this class only requires\u00a0familiarity\u00a0with linear algebra and some programming experience in Python.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Right now we would like to gauge interest in offering this course for the summer so please fill out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW6J89cIqMOckUVqViluh5eIrNWkcMokwqHTb7_cNyroWabw/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this form</a>\u00a0if you are interested.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>#pin</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2020-03-09T23:26:43Z", "subject": "Potential Offering of Summer EECS/BioE C106A/206A", "uid": "is0qs0i9xml26g"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k7l3hiiug0t3it", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11486, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544392251, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6y4cble5r5", "name": "Dinesh Parimi", "photo": "1536104810_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6y4cble5r5/1536104810_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jwslfmrdirb540": 1563406551}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwr5i7l3nr13r6", "name": "Cherish", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6levc483u020k", "name": "Sairanjith Thalanki", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "name": "Shaantam Chawla", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8brfrzt7az", "name": "Amay Saxena", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jvvp09rsgmu1bh", "name": "Long Tong", "photo": "1567023463_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jvvp09rsgmu1bh/1567023463_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzulkqet43lya", "name": "Srinivasa Pranav", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1565840066, "jw6kndsic346lm": 1562564221}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvexhlmpa3zk", "name": "Sunay Poole", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhf1xx1c605", "name": "Alexander Kristoffersen", "photo": "1576016550_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhf1xx1c605/1576016550_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6y4cble5r5", "jwr5i7l3nr13r6", "j6gtkkw4sr227", "j6levc483u020k", "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "is6p8brfrzt7az", "jvvp09rsgmu1bh", "jzulkqet43lya", "jktvexhlmpa3zk", "jktvhf1xx1c605"], "tags": ["announcements", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 1551}
