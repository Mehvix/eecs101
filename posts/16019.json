I know I want to learn more about this field and its applications but I feel I am a bit new to the field to evaluate which one would be a better choice. They&#39;re here below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both are product/MVP-oriented and I&#39;m assuming will give a brief intro to blockchain technologies. The first one seems to focus more on NFTs and their applications to things like creator economies. The second one is more on getting familiar with blockchain platforms and protocols.</p>\n<p>(1) <a href=\"https://scet.berkeley.edu/students/courses/challenge-labs/metaverses-nfts-and-creator-economies-with-blockchain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://scet.berkeley.edu/students/courses/challenge-labs/metaverses-nfts-and-creator-economies-with-blockchain/</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(2) <a href=\"https://scet.berkeley.edu/students/courses/advanced-topics/decentralized-application-dapp-development-and-entrepreneurship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://scet.berkeley.edu/students/courses/advanced-topics/decentralized-application-dapp-development-and-entrepreneurship/</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My question is, which one would be more relevant/useful in the near future?
