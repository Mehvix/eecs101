So the overall order of the waitlist is who sings up at what time (i.e. Bill signs up on Tuesday and Jean signs up on Wednesday, so Billy is #1 and Jean is #2. But, before the adjustment period, the waitlist prioritized freshman and sophomores, first-time transfers, from EECS, L&amp;S, COE, etc. Granted there are a set amount for each of these group restrictions that can enter the class. So when the waitlist processes, and there&#39;s room in one of those groups, the waitlist looks through the list for those students first.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So going back to my example, if Billy is an EECS Sophomore and Jean is an EECS Freshman, and there isn&#39;t room in the Sophomore group but there is a spot open in the Freshman group, when the waitlist processes it&#39;ll automatically add in Jean and not Billy. Sorry if this is a little confusing, but that&#39;s probably the best way I can explain it. Unless your friends are all the same exact same major and are also Freshman with you, that is likely what happened. Their group restriction had openings and yours did not. At this point, however, the waitlist will process folks in order since those group restrictions expired on Friday. I hope this helps answer your question.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2022-01-10T18:14:27Z", "subject": "", "uid": "kvl59eqr39vet"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ky908dhvn0e48n", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ks0loxzw8rb6y": 1639272074}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kq2oorh3udu2wp", "name": "Jonathan Pei", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["kq2oorh3udu2wp"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"12978": 9, "13573": 6, "13979": 8, "14260": 4, "1483": 0, "1892": 1, "2991": 7, "3001": 5, "4422": 2, "7395": 3}}, "created": "2022-01-06T02:08:30Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>How does the EE16B waitlist reordering work?
