TA&#39;s are much less likely to answer that as it is a department/college level thing, and only maybe a head TA would fully be in the loop about that. Advisors might have some idea, but honestly the department is really trying to accommodate all the students and would love to allow everyone to take every class they can. Unfortunately they can&#39;t; there are just too many students and not enough room, professors and TAs, and funding and resources. Unless advisors are fairly certain a class is expanding, they probably wont comment on it and would instead wait until the class is confirmed to be expanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will say that at least with prior offerings of 168, it was intentionally not webcasted due to the pedagogy of the professor. He is not teaching this next semester, but if the professor for next semester follows suit, I doubt 168 will be expanded. This is because webcasted classes are more limited by resources (namely money for TAs). Non-webcasted classes are limited by the room size as well. This means 161 is much more likely to be able to be expanded than 168 most likely</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-11-02T01:30:38Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-11-01T20:23:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Will the class size for 168 or 161 be expanded?
