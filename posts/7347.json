Two things:</p>\n<ol><li>I figure it&#39;s fine, but just to be sure, it&#39;s still okay for me to apply to the major after the semester during which I finished the prerequisites (i.e. submitting by the upcoming August 15th deadline).</li><li>Assuming this is okay, is it typical for the official decision to come out after Phase 1 for people who declare during the summer? i.e. Does declaring a term late potentially jeopardize CS class registration priority? Can&#39;t do much about this I suppose, but figure I should plan ahead for it if it&#39;s an issue.</li></ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, minor, mostly unrelated side note-- do units taken at community colleges back in high school count towards the unit count listed in the major application?
