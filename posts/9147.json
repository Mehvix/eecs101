A student\u2019s major is NOT taken into consideration when the wait list is processed. During Phases 1 and 2, students who meet reserve requirements for a class will be enrolled from the wait list if there are open seats, even before students with a better wait list position who do not meet reserve requirements.<br /><br /></li><li>If enrolling the student into the class will put them over the maximum number of units, the system will also skip the student when processing the wait list. Units for wait listed classes count towards the upper unit limit: 13.5 phase 1, 17.5 phase 2, and 20 units over all.<br /><br /></li><li>Waitlisted students who have time conflicts\u00a0will no longer be held on the waitlist and will now be processed in sequential order like any other student. (As in the past, not meeting a reserve cap or exceeding the unit limit will still prevent students from being enrolled from the wait list.)<br /> <br /> <em>Students on the waitlist for a class are NOT guaranteed to get into the class and should make a reasonable back-up plan.<br /><br /></em></li></ul>\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>70% Rule</strong>\u00a0- When hiring is uncertain for discussion section GSI/TA staff, we hold back 30% of seats. Once we know what the hiring will be for a class, we release these seats back to regular enrollment process. You can expect enrollment for these classes to expand.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>999 sections will be used for many but not all upper div classes</strong>.\u00a0These are faux sections that allow students to enroll in the lecture and the 999 section(s) only via Cal Central.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Since students no longer drop/re-enroll when they want to switch sections, they will no longer risk being bumped to the end of the waitlist when they need to make a change. Additionally, the 999 section has no scheduled day or time which reduces the number of time conflicts that must be processed online. It DOES mean that students need to be patient and wait until class starts to know which section they will actually attend.<br /> <br /> Students can still see the actual section days/times via\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.classes.berkeley.edu/\">classes.berkeley.edu<br /> <br /> <br /> </a></li></ol>\n<p><strong>Assignments to actual sections will be handled outside of Cal Central by faculty\u00a0either:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>During first lecture</li><li>Via communication from instructor to use alternate form (e.g. Google form or SignMeUp!)</li><li>Via course home page</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2019-04-15T00:15:44Z", "subject": "F19 Enrollment: Upper Division Enrollment Notes", "uid": "j0b75czu7362rq"}], "history_size": 15, "i_edits": [], "id": "juhlxf6zppc2h", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9147, "num_favorites": 15, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546877694, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 2273}
