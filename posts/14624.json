I would say a lot of it is about the GIS workflow, how to obtain and store data, different processing methods, etc. You do go into the details of projections, datums (conics, cylindricals, etc.), but without any nitty-gritty math. They do introduce graph/network stuff towards the end, for example, we learned Dijkstra's algorithm from the ground up. =\n\nI thought it was a perfect combination of technical stuff on the CS/DS side of things, and the mapmaking/presentational stuff on the geography side. There are tons of topics that the class covers which leaves the student room to dive deeper\u2014my favorite part was network analysis, but others might enjoy the graphic design of mapmaking, or the statistical interpolation methods, or the different internal data structures, or the GPS/Lidar technology, or the details of projections, etc., etc. The semester I took it the main professor (Radke) was on sabbatical but I've heard good things about him too.\n\nThe workload can be a bit much, especially if you don't primarily use Windows, then you'll have added frustrations of working with virtual machines and the Windows OS.
