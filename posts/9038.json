There is some overlapping content in the first few weeks, but they diverge quickly and towards different topics. 110 is not per se necessary for 281A, however the linear algebra experience can\u2019t hurt. However, what you learn in 127 sufficiently covers the necessary linear algebra, uses it in an applied manner, and then studies optimization specifically using these skills. 110 doesn\u2019t (really) cover optimization, whereas that is the sole goal of 127, which is essential for machine learning and hence 189/281A. As such I think 110 is lacking quite a bit in teaching optimization, which it doesn\u2019t really do. Also, I\u2019ve been told by a previous 127 GSI that 110 is a recommended prerequisite (however I took them concurrently and I don\u2019t think 110 was particularly useful or necessary for 127). In a previous post Prof Sahai also recommended 110 if you\u2019re going to grad school, so if you\u2019re interested in that path then either way you should take 110 and 127.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-05-24T23:19:01Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-02T01:56:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jv6009r9eyaoq", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Does Math 110 count as being equivalent to EECS 127?", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-05-02T01:56:19Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/27 - 1/2", "bucket_order": 23, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-02T00:25:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjeysujfh7y7e8", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Could stat 134&#43;150 be used instead of EE 126?", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2021-01-02T00:25:25Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-08T16:45:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["policy"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p></p>\n<div>We have received several questions about undergraduate enrollment in CS281A.
