The programs under his oversight include the Basic Needs Center, the Centers for Educational Equity and Excellence (CE3), the Disabled Students Program, and Equity and Inclusion STEM Programs. We&#39;ll be taking audience questions the entire duration of the event so its a great opportunity to learn and ask questions about campus goals on student equity, and managing the effects of the pandemic on the student body.
