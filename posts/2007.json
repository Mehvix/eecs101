Relevant portion:\n<blockquote>\nNew Policy Regarding Grading Option for Non-Degree Technical Courses\n\nBeginning Fall 2016, if you are taking a technical course that cannot be used to fulfill any requirement for your major, you may elect to take the course on a pass/no pass (P/NP) basis if you choose the P/NP option by the end of the fifth week of classes. Keep in mind that many COE majors include a minimum number of technical elective units or engineering units, so if the course you are taking can count toward those unit requirements, you must take it for a letter grade. Please check with your adviser if you are unsure if the course can count toward your major requirements. \n\nThis policy is effective Fall 2016. There will be no retroactive changes to grading option for courses completed prior to Fall 2016.\n</blockquote>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hzd1l6l72xn2pt", "updated": "2016-08-25T02:52:22Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-08-25T02:44:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "is9q6zap5li6ly", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Do you have a reference to something that shows that?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2016-08-25T02:44:10Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-08-25T15:42:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>this is correct, please see below quoted email</p>", "created": "2016-08-25T15:42:47Z", "subject": "", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "id": "isai0ar32bz768", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-08-25T00:54:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;ve heard that in my last semester, if I have fulfilled all my technical requirements I can take technical courses as P/NP.
