I think it&#39;s an awesome experience. I am in a similar position to you. This is my last semester so I could have graduated a semester early, but I decided to spend my last semester abroad. I found that, while I didn&#39;t get to take every single class I would have taken, I was able to take the vast majority of classes that interested me.\u00a0<div><br /></div><div>As far as which is better, it really depends. If you have interest in a certain area like machine learning, you should definitely take classes in that area. If you plan on going to grad school, having the extra classes might benefit you as well. Having said that, it&#39;s up to you to decide what you value more, the study abroad experience or the extra classes at Berkeley. I had enough time to finish all my degree requirements and still take I think 3 extra upper div EECS classes, so I feel I got a lot out of my Berkeley courses. Having said that, I found it&#39;s pretty difficult to find programs that would offer CS classes similar to upper division ones at Berkeley. I&#39;m not taking any CS classes while I&#39;m abroad because everything that was available to me I had already taken an equivalent of at Berkeley. And you&#39;re probably going to have a hard time getting any CS or EE you take abroad to transfer back.</div><div><br /></div><div>Study abroad is a really unique experience though. You very rarely can pick up and go live in a foreign county for a few months, so I would personally encourage you to do it! I&#39;m having a great time. But like I said, it&#39;s up to you to figure out what your priorities are.
