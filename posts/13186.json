Basically, no need to be in the lab in person. Your experience taking it on campus and off-campus would not be very different, imo.

It goes over the 5 stage RISCV pipeline again and then introduces other architectural ideas like superscalar out of order execution, vector machines, VLIW machines, and even GPUs. It also goes more depth into caches and memory models. As Anon Comp mentioned below, the labs can be done fully remote and the workload is very reasonable (certainly less than 61C imo). The tests were also just rehashed problem set problems in my semester and there&#39;s no projects. I highly recommend taking a look at the course website (<a href=\"https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp20/</a>).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>151 is also more of 61C, but along the lines of project 3. We learned Verilog (a HDL that&#39;s widely used in industry) in the first two weeks. In terms of workload, it&#39;s probably pertinent to point out that 151 is a 5 unit class (3 unit lecture &#43; 2 unit lab). In contrast, 152, 162, 164, and 189 are all 4 unit classes. You can choose between 2 lab options: FPGA and ASIC. For ASIC, I think there&#39;s not much difference between remote vs in-person as everything is done via instructional machines either way. For FPGA, you mess around with a physical device which I would assume is easier to debug in person than over Zoom. Apparently a popular? option is to take one lab with the lecture in one semester, and then to do the other lab by itself in a future semester.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2020-10-01T19:25:38Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "kfr7kxyrnbk4qs", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jvydfbvhfxs3kt", "name": "Kishore Kumar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jvydfbvhfxs3kt", "j6gtkkw4sr227"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10890": 4, "11332": 9, "11807": 7, "12334": 5, "3623": 3, "3702": 0, "470": 8, "5496": 2, "8222": 6, "8996": 1}}, "created": "2020-09-30T04:25:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Which course would be a better pick for next semester for someone who is currently taking 61c and 16b especially since next sem is online too?</p>", "created": "2020-09-30T04:47:46Z", "subject": "CS 152 vs EECS 151", "uid": "jvydfbvhfxs3kt"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Which course would be a better pick for next semester who is currently taking 61c and 16b especially since next sem is online too?</p>", "created": "2020-09-30T04:25:31Z", "subject": "CS 152 vs EECS 151", "uid": "jvydfbvhfxs3kt"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kfovzje47r662v", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13186, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542503582, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 383}
