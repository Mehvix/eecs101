CS370 is our equity-based CS pedagogy course that meets the course requirement for TAs. It&#39;s a highly interactive class where you participate in building materials and resources to help you as a tutor, mentor, and TA--most of the material translates well to industry and academia too. Anyone who has attended Cal for one semester and isn&#39;t graduating next semester is eligible to apply.</p>\n<p>This course is 3 units and does require tutoring each week (1-3 hours per week depending on your potential course staff roles; most non-TAs complete 3 hours per week). Students thus far find it to be worthwhile.</p>\n<div>\n<p></p>\n<p>We&#39;ve received 200&#43; applications for the past several semesters so please apply by Oct. 31 for highest priority. We are scaling to 160 students, and the sections will be Wednesdays 5:00pm-6:30pm or Thursdays 5:00pm-6:30pm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Application: <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fforms%2FaYbNmBweaHePyKuD2%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1Q1kNZmLgF05TVR4RAcra5R3qCDUAxA75SBvMn2jKvcoDgwQ0GROV9MQs&amp;h=AT2owDNn8BVobMqMkd3kSV0jiUpfNeCay97JDc04Vwo2bJe2b4lspBu08plVvk0Or00ofbRCfD79VjANuf1688aKaQWBCqZ4STyRJZuVIOn-qtRidQq0wJg5y_0e4unloquzOX6QGifN5xh5FB7unsPhn2YndQvg_3WAdWlM\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/forms/aYbNmBweaHePyKuD2</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more information, check out our website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Finst.eecs.berkeley.edu%2F%7Ecs370%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0EI-l12QJSUAe_pP_HJEZXtR_OUHakH3riNRT4OMzXzEH9oQs_Rb1NZJc&amp;h=AT2DmBxAm6XL7IbsVU3aGI7kETJfbs6dh2PWCO9r6wGacE7jEePSzjP5d52DvM9ucNjoHbtJD7O5SycCjukzoKHvia9SRh4-OcEITf_x7_hqhNq8tGAHYETZkmAJBxAk7Eq_OVu_nSpg7z6-rAvLieJXLLajVXM7EvnZ5a9o\" target=\"_blank\">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs370/</a>\u2026</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For our student feedback, check out our HKN Evaluations:<br /> <a href=\"https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/course/CS/370?fbclid=IwAR2TglWqc0tSRLQFrQZJTDF3qLctIS7X55tGB9nObY53GpwzyjM_gg-RfjY\" target=\"_blank\">https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/course/CS/370</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feel free to email cthunn&#64;berkeley.edu with questions</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PS Please also feel free to distribute this via relevant channels (Piazzas, student orgs, etc.).</p>\n</div>", "created": "2018-10-19T23:50:00Z", "subject": "Take CS370: Teaching CS this Spring; application is now live!", "uid": "halg8jo1i9m2ye"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jngo2jz85fy2pk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7972, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548405201, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "cs-intended", "eecs", "enrichment_opportunities", "instructor-note", "lscs", "tutoring"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 393}
