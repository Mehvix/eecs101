Thanks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gracias por the reply :) So I&#39;m enrolled in CS 170, CS 61C, EE 16A, and Polecon 100 at the moment, and I&#39;m 99% sure that I want to drop either 16A or Polecon 100. Reason 1 is I think 170 and 61C are both very useful and I want to keep them. Reason 2 is that I think I can handle at most 3 out of my current 4 classes. I squeaked into the CS major with a 3.33. I also want to spend more time than in the past (read: any time at all) on personal projects and recruiting this semester.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So should I drop 16A to have more time for other things, or is there hope that I can do 170, 61C, and 16A together while still spending a good amount of time on my extracurriculars?</p>", "created": "2017-08-30T21:43:22Z", "subject": "Asking for an opinion on courseload...", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!
