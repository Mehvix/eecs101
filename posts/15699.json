Some questions we hope to help members address: Where can ML be impactful? What topics does ML research cover and how are they important? What are the limitations and possibilities of ML? How do I engage with specific topics further? </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We hope to provide members with a platform to understand where to start and what to work on, while building a community throughout. This includes getting matched with an ML@B mentor and provided with comprehensive resources for further ML education and opportunities. We will host \u201chow-to\u201d style educational workshops (research, recruiting, ethics, side projects), group socials, tech talks, and mini reading groups. This is a great opportunity to craft a guided and supervised plan that works towards some personal learning goals of yours \u2014 whatever they might be!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Visit our website for more information on how to apply at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/grep-info.\">bit.ly/grep-info.</a> <strong>Apply at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/grep-fa21\">http://tinyurl.com/grep-fa21</a> by Monday, 9/13 11:59 PM (PDT).</strong> <strong>This program is designed for beginners and all majors, no prior ML experience necessary.</strong> Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkbsoccq29i9zs%2F73522227a229c2bd85b8d4117ff47f648ab38ca6bd15ba1284042e0e50ead43c%2Fupdated_grepflyer.png\" width=\"1001\" height=\"712\" alt=\"\" /></p>", "created": "2021-09-13T17:49:04Z", "subject": "Join GREP: Guided Resource and Education Program in Machine Learning!", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "ktixxcxjegt5d2", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 15699, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539721854, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "enrichment_opportunities", "events", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 266}
