Dear god did I see my fellow classmates waste their time reading the notes super carefully. This is probably very different advice from some people but I only ever read the notes as a reference, I&#39;ve probably read 20% of the information in the notes. Instead, I&#39;d advise going to lecture and if there was a proof you didn&#39;t understand fully, check in the notes. The notes are so dense that I personally think it&#39;s a waste of time. Just passively reading the notes is not how you should learn.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>INSTEAD:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Go to discussions and take notes during their mini-lectures. This is the only time I ever took notes. Basically a lot of 70 is learning true statements and facts about various concepts and then deriving proofs about them. I personally found discussions to be mostly where I learned (I&#39;d fall asleep a lot in lecture....) and they helped a lot. The TA&#39;s are quite amazing at teaching, take advantage of that!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However this \u00a0strategy may have just worked for me, so take it, as well as all advice, with a grain of salt.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2017-05-18T23:47:30Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-05-18T23:38:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j2v24dfiktj441", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I did really well in CS70: here are some things I did.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. REALLY do the homework. Do not look at possible solutions online. I found this to probably be the number one most contributing factor as to why I did well. I remember some of my friends would give up rather easily, would copy and look at solutions, and then would wonder as to how I&#39;m so good at CS70. The homework is written carefully for you to practice and learn, take advantage of that! If you get stuck on problems, go to homework party -- there has always been a surplus of TA&#39;s wanting to help whenever I&#39;ve went.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. If you&#39;re super adamant on doing well in 70, you might want to consider taking 134 concurrently. I did that not realizing how much of the probability portion of CS70 overlaps with it. 134 gave me so much background and intuition with probability that the second half of 70 was SO easy. In addition, 134 is a fantastic class - especially with Ani Adhikari (probably the best professor I&#39;ve ever had). I felt I had SUCH a good grasp on probability after every lecture of hers.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>hmm.. I thought I&#39;d have more reasons but yeah this is pretty much it! Don&#39;t do the no homework option, I highly discourage it. CS70 requires a lot of proof and logical thinking which takes practice for it to come intuitive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>good luck! :)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2017-05-18T23:38:17Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/14 - 5/20", "bucket_order": 164, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/14 - 5/20", "bucket_order": 164, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-05-19T00:57:46Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j2v4yl9ympi71r", "subject": "<p>This is Anon from the first follow-up.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>YES.
