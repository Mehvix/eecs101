Taking lower-div math classes might help but they seem more like computation classes to me than classes that develop that proof-writing, creative problem-solving, part of your brain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From what you have posted seems like you have an insane work ethic and I would very much recommend working through an <a href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/store\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Art of Problem Solving book</a>. (Full disclosure I have worked for them in the past but only applied for a job because was a big user of their products before that).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d wager that 60% of math majors here have worked through those books and they do a good job of building that ability to tackle somewhat open-ended math problems where the approach is not clear. They don&#39;t follow the standard textbook format and instead make you work through problems to &#34;discover&#34; math ideas which I think would be extremely valuable for you. In particular I think working through their Intermediate Probability and Intermediate Algebra book as they start off intuitive and then gradually becomes less intuitive which builds the skills you are looking for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally I completely get the desire to keep-up with your peers and while some people might argue (and might be right) that it&#39;s not the healthiest mindset, I def think it&#39;s a valid emotion that you are dealing with. One thing I would recommend is focus on systems classes that do not need as much mathy thinking. I think you would do very well in 61c, 162, 152, 164 etc and can take these sooner and faster than your peers due to your apparent work ethic and work capacity. In the mean time you can build mathematical maturity and save theory/math heavy stuff for a sem or two down the road.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Based on the picture you painted above, I am sure that once you build fluency with &#34;mathy&#34; thinking you will blitz through upper-divs and even grad courses.

I did fairly well on the 16B midterm, but it was difficult for me to keep up with the math in the class after. Once I was behind by a few weeks, I felt really intimidated looking at the homeworks and ended up P/NPing the class. I'm worried this has left me with a gap in my understanding for future classes, and I'm not sure how best to address it.\n\nThis semester, I\u2019ve been feeling low about myself as I was originally taking 70 + 120 but had to drop 120 because the math got too much for me (yet again, as in 16B).\n\nWhile I think I should take something like Math 53 and/or Math 54 to work on my fundamentals (and get over the slowly developing fear of intimidating math-y notation), I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be going at a much slower pace than my peers and not pushing myself.\n\nI know that strong conceptual understanding is paramount and I wouldn't say I feel embarrassed to take a slower path, but taking this route would result in me not having taken any upper divs by the end of my sophomore year at Cal. My friends say I'm worrying too much and that I should go ahead and take upper-divs (and self-study the background material, if needed) - but I'm not sure if I'm convinced.\n\nThoughts? I feel really bad about myself for how much I seem to be struggling with high-level math when it's never really been a weak point for me.</md>", "created": "2021-10-28T03:56:25Z", "subject": "Feeling low about myself :(", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 4, "i_edits": [], "id": "kvaezw09ljyir", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16002, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539395340, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c1n1u3er7jw", "name": "Jainil Ajmera", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1634968418_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1634968418_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jkimygtzhd22g2", "name": "Edgar Hildebrandt Rojo", "photo": "1534264794_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jkimygtzhd22g2/1534264794_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijj65wyjr094o", "name": "Denesh Chandrahasan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke2c1n1u3er7jw", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "jkimygtzhd22g2", "ijj65wyjr094o"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 576}
