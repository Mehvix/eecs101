Also, I&#39;ve taken only CS classes so far (except EE 16A), so my background so far is similar to a CS major. I want to do an extra semester to get a CS minor (just need 2 more UD CS classes), take some interesting non-CS/technical classes (i.e. IEOR, DES INV), and get involved with campus clubs/organizations (since I didn&#39;t in my 1st year here).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My main question: Should I do an internship in Fall 2019 and then do my extra/5th semester in Spring 2020 (option 1) or do my extra semester in Fall 2019 (option 2)? I&#39;m unsure of what do because if I do option 1, will companies look down on graduating later, and even if they don&#39;t, are there any downsides to late graduation that I&#39;m unaware of, and if so, what are they? That said, with option 2, I&#39;m not sure if companies will start new grads in the spring semester time (do they?), and if they don&#39;t, I&#39;d have to figure out what to do for a semester (i.e. online courses, traveling, etc) until companies start new grads in the summer/fall.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d really appreciate any advice on which option to go with and why.
