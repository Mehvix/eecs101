Personally I would not recommend taking 127 if you haven&#39;t taken 16B or Math 110 yet. While 127 does do a significant amount of Linear Algebra review, it already assumes that you&#39;ve taken 16B, and have a decently strong background in Math / Linear Algebra from the start, and then jumps into a bunch of other optimization topics assuming you remember most of the concepts from 16B.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d personally recommend taking 61B and 16B, and finishing your lower divs, before taking more upper div classes, since upper divs are much easier and enjoyable once you build the strong foundational skills in lower divs. I think 188 might also be a class worth taking, since you&#39;ve taken 70 and Prob 140, although it may be a bit difficult if you haven&#39;t taken 61B. I&#39;d also look into 61C even if you aren&#39;t that interested in hardware, since many upper div EECS classes will assume that you&#39;ve taken 61C.</p>", "created": "2019-10-31T21:49:39Z", "subject": "", "uid": "isavdtjxldo7pe"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "k2f8rxf7bod2f9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1569903596, "jzdc840hwmd7dc": 1569898318}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isavdtjxldo7pe", "name": "Taejin Hwang", "photo": "1507076312_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/isavdtjxldo7pe/1507076312_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["isavdtjxldo7pe"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-30T22:55:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi, I plan to take CS 61B next semester and want some advice on the second technical course.
