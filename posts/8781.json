well!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I do think it&#39;s really important to consider how much time you&#39;ll be spending recruiting in the fall vs. what you want to learn. It&#39;s something I&#39;m struggling with too because there are plenty of things I want to take still!\u00a0 But for the sake of your sanity while recruiting I&#39;m not sure if that fall semester is the best suggestion; I&#39;d\u00a0just leave out 161 entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My two cents on it: I took 161 and 162 together while recruiting (the ol&#39; 3-5 interviews a week) and it definitely made last semester the worst so far in Berkeley (granted, I\u00a0am also heavily involved in multiple ECs); 161 is a &#34;broad but shallow&#34; coverage of security topics which makes parts of exams somewhat similar to trivia quizzes (our final had a good deal of fill-in-the-blank), while 162 is more of a deep dive. You&#39;ll pretty much always have a project, design doc, or homework due for 162, and while 161 is on/off workload-wise the projects are kind of &#34;bang-your-head-against-it&#34; style if you&#39;re new to security concepts. TLDR 161 is really interesting and was a fun course, but I&#39;d say 162 is much more worth it (and I personally loved the course!).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- also the draft schedule only has 164 for the fall which is a big sad ): trying to figure out if I should bite the bullet and\u00a0take it during recruiting season</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-03-27T04:11:22Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-02-21T18:55:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "enrollments", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m currently an EECS junior and was\u00a0wondering which upper div CS courses I should take for my last two semesters.
