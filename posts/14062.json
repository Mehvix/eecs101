The most applicable math courses for CS majors are probably math 104 and 110 but you most likely don't need anything from these classes if your focus is SWE. Math 110 is advanced linear algebra (think math 54++) and math 104 is real analysis (basically rigorously proving calculus). I haven't taken math 110 although I have read the Axler book in my spare time, but I've heard from friends that the class is enjoyable. I didn't really like math 104 a whole lot, but I have found the concepts quite useful in some of the more mathy EE/CS classes. If you want to take something for fun, I really liked math 113 but note that you will likely never use concepts from this class in practice. Math 113 teaches abstract algebra which introduces you to properties of groups and rings. In your case I'd consider taking a math course for the sake of \"mathematical maturity\" or for the sake of doing something different/fun as I don't foresee most of these concepts being useful in a traditional software job.</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jlpihhme1ha2fk", "name": "Yebin Seo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jlpihhme1ha2fk", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-01-04T01:24:57Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11033": 0, "11791": 5, "5193": 1, "6597": 8, "6749": 7, "8000": 2, "8057": 4, "8060": 3, "8523": 6, "9583": 9}}, "created": "2021-01-03T09:40:04Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello.
