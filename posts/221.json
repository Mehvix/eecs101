I scored slightly above the median for the first midterm but I can&#39;t see myself even getting a B if he curves around a C-. Several people have told me that there&#39;s no policy in the math department about requiring professors to curve around a B- like in the CS department, so I&#39;m really worried about my grade because I honestly believe that Wodzicki is not joking around (especially because he has tenure). I have been really stressed about this and I guess I just want to know what&#39;s going to happen (e.g he&#39;s allowed to do this so just brace yourself, or no, he probably won&#39;t do it and is just saying he will).
