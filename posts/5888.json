It has a lot of problems and also has conceptual review. Don&#39;t feel incompetent, the ind of problems you see in coding challenges and interviews are often different from the type of challenges we are presented in class. Everyone is in the same boat, and the best thing you can do is practice. Leetcode is great for this as an endless source of practice problems. I also really liked firecode.io, it gives you problems to do in an organized manner while Leetcode is more of a vast database of problems. 61B is enough for many of the problems you&#39;ll see, but 170 helps out as well with the more complicated problem types (Dynamic Programming, advanced graph search, etc.) Make sure you have the basics of 61B down (<a href=\"http://bigocheatsheet.com\">http://bigocheatsheet.com</a>) is a great source for this, know your runtimes, know why the runtimes are why they are, know the sort algorithms/tradeoffs (Ex. Why might it be better to use merge sort over quick sort?, When can quick sort not be the best choice?, etc.).

First off, don&#39;t feel discouraged. Many students, <strong>including</strong> myself, have phases of struggling before landing their first offer.

Don&#39;t get too caught up on this, the main purpose is to brush up. Once you have done this, begin doing problem on leetcode, hackerrank, and &#39;Cracking The Coding Interview&#39;. After every problem you complete, always think about the runtime and space complexity. In addition to practicing online, also practice <strong>writing out</strong>\u00a0your answers to prepare for whiteboarding interviews. Even better, get a group of friends (or just a friend) to\u00a0do mock whiteboard interviews. It&#39;s all about <strong>practice</strong> and <strong>repetition</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, there is a student organization on campus, called Codeology,\u00a0that dedicates\u00a0their time to helping students like\u00a0you prepare for coding and behavioral interviews!
