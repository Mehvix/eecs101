I will say the linear algebra + multivariate portions are incredibly important. You are expected to have decent mastery over concepts like semipositive definite matrices (which I didn't when I went in, and had a _very_ rough time). If you were to take this class without 53, I'd recommend you to read up on partial derivatives and gradients for matrices, as that will come into heavy usage.
