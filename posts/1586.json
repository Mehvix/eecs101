Even if it&#39;s midterm 2 and u already have notes from midterm 1, still take those notes again.</div><div>2) Print out all the tests you plan to take and take all but the two most recent of them. After each exam, grade them and for EACH question you get wrong write at least one note on a seperate page on how to crack that style of problem (like a step by step &#34;look at this&#34; &#34;pay attention to that&#34; thing).</div><div>3) Copy a summarized version of ur notes on ur cheat sheet(s) and leave a section to copy down the notes u wrote specific to ur mistakes on a test.</div><div>4) The night before the exam and perhaps the morning of the exam, take those last two tests and make slight adjustments to ur cheat sheet accordingly.</div><div><br /></div><div>This strategy really helped me out specifically for 61A.
