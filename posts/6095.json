It will be an opportunity for SFUSD 10th, 11th and 12th graders to attend science tours/explorations at STEM focused worksites that will provide them with first-hand experience of the work of scientists and engineers, and to meet informally with a wide range of STEM professionals at a speed networking lunch. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of this day, we are recruiting STEM Ambassadors to serve as near peer mentors to the high school students, helping the SFUSD students bridge the path to college and ultimately career. STEM Ambassadors will accompany the high school students to the STEM worksite tours and during the speed networking lunch. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We believe the STEM Ambassadors will play a very important role during the day.\u00a0 While closer in age to the participating high school students, their having already navigated the transition to higher education and decided to pursue a STEM career will help the younger students realize that a similar path is within their reach. Because of their additional experience and maturity, they will also be well suited to help nucleate questions and conversations with at the tour sites and with the STEM mentors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Volunteers will join the students on an interactive tour at or nearby Mission Bay, engage in informal conversations with the students about their own interests in science, their educational pathway and careers goals, at the tours and in conversations over lunch. Your experiences will be of great interest to high school students who are eager to learn what diverse options in STEM fields are open to them! This kind of informal interaction with students can be of enormous importance to them at this early stage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We encourage grad students, post-docs, lab researchers, and others to help in this effort and share with the students!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested?

It will be an opportunity for SFUSD 10th, 11th and 12th graders to attend science tours/explorations at STEM focused worksites that will provide them with first-hand experience of the work of scientists and engineers, and to meet informally with a wide range of STEM professionals at a speed networking lunch. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of this day, we are recruiting STEM Ambassadors to serve as near peer mentors to the high school students, helping the SFUSD students bridge the path to college and ultimately career. STEM Ambassadors will accompany the high school students to the STEM worksite tours and during the speed networking lunch. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We believe the STEM Ambassadors will play a very important role during the day.\u00a0 While closer in age to the participating high school students, their having already navigated the transition to higher education and decided to pursue a STEM career will help the younger students realize that a similar path is within their reach. Because of their additional experience and maturity, they will also be well suited to help nucleate questions and conversations with at the tour sites and with the STEM mentors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Volunteers will join the students on an interactive tour at or nearby Mission Bay, engage in informal conversations with the students about their own interests in science, their educational pathway and careers goals, at the tours and in conversations over lunch. Your experiences will be of great interest to high school students who are eager to learn what diverse options in STEM fields are open to them! This kind of informal interaction with students can be of enormous importance to them at this early stage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We encourage grad students, post-docs, lab researchers, and others to help in this effort and share with the students!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested?
