There&#39;s an old adage that if we knew the system state at exactly the current time, we wouldn&#39;t need control. A big part of control is deriving controllers that are robust to disturbances, sensor noise, and model uncertainty, and you need to consider probability to do that effectively. Stochastic control and robust control are two major subfields which concentrate on systems with uncertainty. In fact the Kalman filter, which all the ML people use so much, is the solution to the Linear Quadratic Gaussian problem, a fundamental result in stochastic control.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In robotics, any sort of system identification will use a lot of probability, as will any sort of perception (SLAM, state estimation, sensor fusion, etc).
