CS information will be posted when ready.**</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dear Students,</p>\n<p>We will continue to override time conflicts for students for this spring. Please see information below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The enrollment system does not allow you to enroll directly in classes that have time\u00a0conflicts. This must be processed by the SIS team (<a href=\"http://sis.berkeley.edu/time-conflict\">instructions</a>).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>If you have filled out the SIS\u00a0form, but your request has still not been processed after 36 hours</strong>, we will override class\u00a0conflicts\u00a0for you via a Google\u00a0form\u00a0(links below), space permitting. Please note that by filling out the\u00a0form(s), you agree to have a class\u00a0conflict\u00a0overridden for you. It is your responsibility to check the attendance policies and make plans for\u00a0conflicting\u00a0exams.\u00a0You must be waitlisted for the class in which you&#39;re requesting to enroll.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Please do not contact us after filling out the\u00a0form</strong><strong>\u00a0to check on the status of your request.</strong>\u00a0We will process the requests as soon as we are able.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bMhoyBS6hQ_e5N0kZTn-5V4gqJ1sBlqukkXas1ZXvJk/edit\">EE\u00a0Conflict\u00a0Override\u00a0Form</a>\u00a0(use this\u00a0form\u00a0for EECS classes as well)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Use the EE form, if you&#39;re trying to enroll in an EE or EECS class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You must meet the enrollment priorities (if any) when you fill out the form in order to be enrolled. There must be space open in your category in order for you to be enrolled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>**Please make sure you have checked your enrolled and waitlisted units. Phase I maximum is 13.5, Phase II is 17.5, and the Adjustment Period is 20.5. We cannot override the maximum units for you and this causes a delay in processing requests.**</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the class is full and/or you do not meet enrollment priorities, you will not be enrolled. If you do not provide 2nd and 3rd choices for secondary sections (if applicable) and your first choice fills, you will not be enrolled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>EECS Student Affairs</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong>:</p>\n<p>Q: When should I use the\u00a0form?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A:\u00a0<strong>After you have first filled out the SIS\u00a0form and waited 36 hours</strong>.\u00a0<a href=\"http://sis.berkeley.edu/time-conflict\">Instructions here</a>.
