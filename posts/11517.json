I think you can consider Data 100. It satisfies applied math data science cluster and cs upper division. It is easier than CS 61A. I personally did Data 100 and Math 104 last summer and the workload is doable. One of my classmates did well in Math 104 and CS 188 last summer, but CS 188 is said to have\u00a0much tougher exam than Data 100 and I have not taken CS 188, so I am not sure if CS 188 and Math 104 is doable. You can also consider Math 113. I think it has similar workload and difficulty compared to Math 104, but I heard some people think Math 113 is easier than Math 104.</p>", "created": "2020-03-19T03:49:18Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>ee16b</p>", "created": "2020-03-19T03:24:45Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "id": "k7y6ya1insz41s", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jy4rswsditj4ke", "name": "Abayjeet Singh", "photo": "1580094465_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jy4rswsditj4ke/1580094465_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jy4rswsditj4ke"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"3759": 5, "3810": 6, "4078": 4, "4158": 8, "4868": 1, "6902": 9, "6947": 7, "8824": 3, "8987": 2, "9822": 0}}, "created": "2020-03-19T03:08:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Hi guys,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I am super confused what class to take with cs188 in the summer.
