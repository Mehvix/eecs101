Usually, it is reserved for people who are TA&#39;ing over the summer. Also, you cannot backdate a course from spring if summer is your last semester as an undergrad, so that strictly works against your favor if you are taking a class right now that you want to backdate. \n\nI am a current 5th year masters student and I took a class over summer as a visiting grad student. It is a bit more expensive than undergraduate summer classes, unfortunately, but the class I took was a prereq for 2 classes that I took in Fall/am taking this Spring, so I thought it was worth it. \n\nIn regards to having a &#34;tidy&#34; transcript, you will have two transcripts anyway: undergrad and grad. My summer class is part of my grad transcript.
