If you have significant internship/industry experience already, then 169 won&#39;t really be useful to you. While 186 is one of the more &#34;basic&#34; upper division courses in CS, I have found that what I learned in the class is definitely valuable when it comes to industry. Specifically, knowledge of how databases work, MVCC, locking, etc. are all essential when it comes to industry. But like I mentioned earlier if you personally don&#39;t have much industry experience then 169 could be more beneficial to you in the sense that it&#39;ll give you that experience.
