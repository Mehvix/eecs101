If you got a good score in 61A, then 61B shouldn&#39;t be a problem as it is more straightforward but it is still a lot work in terms of projects but you will have almost no problem picking up new material in data structures. It is still a large leap in my opinion as projects become super large and no more hand-holding (nothing drastic or too big you can&#39;t handle in my opinion)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have 0 knowledge in linear algebra and a shaky background in circuits, I feel that 16A will eat up more time for you than 61B. A lot of my friends who are super strong in CS (A in 61A/B/C/70/170) completely struggle in EE16A/B in general because of amount of work (8~10 hrs of homework weekly and could be more if you&#39;re super shaky), super hard midterms, and just the feel is SUPER different from a CS class in general.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also keep in mind summer is twice the pace, so go at your own risk. 8 units would be equivalent to 16 units normal pace in a semester.
