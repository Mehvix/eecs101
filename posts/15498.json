You are required to complete the lab and submit to Gradescope in preparation for your lab.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although we are explicitly recruiting for labs, there may be opportunities to help out with project office hours throughout the semester. This will be optional, but if you have completed Gitlet or Enigma in the past we may ask you to help out.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For your time and effort as an Intern, you will be awarded 1 unit of PNP credit for the Fall 2021 semester. Completing all of the above bullet points will get you a P. <strong>You cannot become an intern without taking the class for a unit.</strong></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1WYayokzlTrllATbUCga4rzWTgXzJiKRPfudNk46okS37TQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\">The Application is Available Here</a>. It is officially due Sunday, August 22nd, at 11:59pm PDT, but depending on demand we may accept rolling applications up through August 24 (the day before school starts). Expect decisions during the first week of classes.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some common questions I always get about applying to be an intern:</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do I need to have gotten an A in 61B to apply?</strong></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No, the application process is grade blind (the application does not even ask for your grade in 61B). You are selected based off your answers to the application questions. Potential applicants often express to me that they do not feel &#34;qualified&#34; for the position, but in my experience they always are. This is as much as opportunity for you to learn the material a second time as it is to get teaching experience.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>I am undecided if I want to apply, should I?</strong></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are considering becoming an intern but unsure if you can commit to it, I would recommend filling the application out anyways. You will have a chance to turn the position down if you are accepted but cannot accept.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What times are available for labs?</strong></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This will not be decided until closer towards the semester. Labs are normally W-F.
