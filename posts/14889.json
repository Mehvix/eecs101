Right now, I&#39;m split between taking 161 &#43; 186 &#43; 2 breadths vs taking 161 &#43; 186 &#43; 188 &#43; 1 breadth (basically replacing a breadth with 188). My current semester is 162 &#43; 127 &#43; 2 breadths and so far it&#39;s been a very easy workload wise semester. Another thing that might be relevant is that I&#39;m generally better at system/programming classes in comparison to theoretical classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do you guys think the 3 techs workload would be doable?

Should I Phase 1 all three techs or is there one of them that you know you can comfortably get in even with Phase 2?
