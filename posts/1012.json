It is going to be pretty tough as those 3 classes have considerably more projects than 170,188 and 186 which have fewer\u00a0and shorter projects. There was also a lot of overlap among the projects in the 3 classes which made it pretty stressful at times.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would phase 1 168 for sure and then maybe 161. 168 is only offered in the Fall I think. And normally 162 doesn&#39;t get filled up too quickly as it is a considerably tougher class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>161 was the easiest and least time consuming out of the 3. It is going to probably be different among professors, but I would consider it more like 186 this semester (except 161 has homeworks AND projects). You have midterms, a couple of projects and then for my semester, 161 had homework every week. The lecture and project material was very interesting though!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>168 was probably the next easiest. You had 4 homeworks and 4 projects. The homeworks were not bad, the projects were alright, but had a lot of edge cases you had to pass. This was my most favorite class as the professor and material was fun!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>162 was the hardest. You are in a group of 4 people and do 3 group projects with the entire semester. These projects are nothing to joke about, they are ridiculously time consuming and tough. Probably nothing like any other class project before, and it&#39;s also in C, which makes it twice as fun. You had around 5 homeworks which were like the 186/161 projects. But this is a good class and you do learn how to work in a group and you learn alot of material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So it might be a tough semester especially if the projects/midterms within the classes overlap, so use your time well! Good luck! =D</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2016-03-28T17:05:24Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-03-28T04:41:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>How does a schedule of 161 &#43; 162 &#43; 168 &#43; research sound?
