Economics has had a long and deep relationship to control theory (especially stochastic control theory) and optimization. So, taking 126 and 127 is clearly going to strengthen the appropriate muscles in a big way. The modeling aspects of probability are more important than the algorithm-analysis aspects, so 126 is definitely way more important than 174. Taking 170 is always good, and it is a prereq to other courses that will help. It depends on what econometrics type courses you take, but I think that 189 is another core EECS course that could be good for a complementary perspective, but 126 and 127 are way more important.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You need to be taking lots of math courses though as well for preparation.
