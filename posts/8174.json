During project crunches for 61c you will have to manage your time wisely to keep up with 70 psets, but as long as you take advantage of resources and work hard you should be alright. That said, I do agree with the response above in that if you are worried about declaring you should take them one at a time so you can dedicate more time to focusing on doing very well in 70.</p>", "created": "2018-11-09T21:19:16Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I am taking 61c right now (with 168 and 170) and took 70 last semester (with EE16B and an IEOR upper div).
