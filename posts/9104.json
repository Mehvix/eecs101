I have had multiple friends who took the class with random team members and hated their semester. To this day, after graduation, they regret taking the course. Yes, you will &#34;learn a lot&#34;, but at what cost? There&#39;s a chance you&#39;ll be spending a lot of your time on this class, and if other partners aren&#39;t contributing or need a lot of time to solve problems, you might also regret taking it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here is my suggestion: Sure, it&#39;s an important class. Doesn&#39;t mean you have to take it at Cal. Take 61c, 161, 168, 186, and then by then, you will probably find 3 people to take the class with. That is when you should take it. By then, I think you can easily self study it. A lot of the &#34;skills you gain&#34; in the class are gained from taking 161, 168, and 186 anyways. Some people say 162 is hard to self study, and I disagree, if you&#39;ve taken some of the classes I listed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have other friends who just self studied it and learned plenty, with a lot less stress, and are doing great in industry. 162 is not the magic bullet to more salary, prestige, nor is it the bare minimum to pass an interview. But it definitely has fascinating and wonderful material, so if you don&#39;t take the class, highly recommend self studying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#34;I hate that not having a group is making me not think I will be able to take this class, so I am just curious what others think or if they found groups easily in the class itself&#34;. Don&#39;t hate your feelings :) It&#39;s great you&#39;re considering mental health and enjoying your semester. The culture at times seems to reward those who push themselves beyond their limits, as the assumption is they will grow immensely and bring greater rewards in the future. But this is only true on a case by case basis. 162 is a really time consuming and difficult course. Sure, you may survive. But if you&#39;re drowning in working on projects, you&#39;ll have less time to actually learn the material in this class and other classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you trust your abilities and feel comfortable picking 3 random group mates, go ahead and take it. As others said above, they were fine. I will just reiterate, you&#39;re not guaranteed to get a solid group, which could make the semester miserable. I always put my health over my academic and career goals.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jc9f97h7meo5pq": 1521433550}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j52tu6m8x47le", "name": "Rahul Rathi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j52tu6m8x47le"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2019-04-12T20:05:06Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/18 - 8/24", "bucket_order": 40, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-23T04:17:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jznlt2hckmd3rp", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Does anyone know what the group sizes usually are?\u00a0", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2019-08-23T04:17:29Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-12T03:45:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I want to take 162 but I don&#39;t know anyone taking it this Fall.
