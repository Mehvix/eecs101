Is it possible to to take these three classes together and do well if you have a lot of relevant experience? Of course. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea though. Studying CS at Berkeley is about so much more than the classes you take. Building relationships with piers is far more rewarding and will be far more useful to you in the real world. Joining\u00a0a club and taking on leadership positions will help you grow. Doing research will be more useful to you if you want to pursue an academic career and will challenge you in a completely different way. Personal projects will let you focus on what you find most fun to develop and will make you a better software developer for industry. Having a job (in CS or not) will show you how to be a professional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There&#39;s also a lot more to college than just preparing yourself for a career in CS. You should take classes in other departments (more than what LS/EECS require) to learn about different subjects and to see what else you have interests in. This is a unique time in your life socially as well. You&#39;ll never be around so many other like-minded people with similar interests that are the same age as you again. This is the the time of your life when you learn so much about yourself because of the unique experiences you can have. Don&#39;t waste this time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m a senior and when I graduate next semester I will have taken literally every undergrad class in CS that interested me (which is most of them) and a grad class. I could have taken even more grad classes if I didn&#39;t flirt with two different double majors and waste time taking their useless prereqs. I never took a schedule this challenging and because of that I got to do pretty much all of things I mentioned above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll step off my soapbox now and say that the obvious exceptions apply if you have to graduate early for personal/financial reasons or if you are a transfer student.
