And get some sense of proper form. And be able to lift a few more pounds. Sure some people can lift 70 lbs with bad form, but this is probably a hinderance long term rather than a help.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But then another person said, that is silly. Lifting the bar is not nearly enough weight. It&#39;s not like lifting 70 lbs.\u00a0All\u00a0you need to do is to be able to lift 70 lbs. Then, you&#39;ll be able to lift 70 lbs.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Who is right? Why? What is the goal?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A and then EE16B are designed in lots of ways (both subtle and obvious) to help students overcome bad mental habits and &#34;poor form&#34; that hurt them. Remember, the faculty who designed EE16AB had experience seeing the struggles students had in 70. We saw the tears and doubt and paralysis and feelings of being left behind of students who lacked the mathematical maturity, or worse, had anti-maturity. 70 teaches good form from a point, but assumes other things. EE16A and then EE16B are designed to bring people to the point that they can get the most out of 70. Not to teach them the material in 70. That would be silly and redundant, and a waste of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Learning how to do proofs properly is a topic for 70. Learning how to think more clearly about definitions themselves and what they mean --- that is something important in 16AB. Learning how to make tactical and strategic choices in proofs is\u00a0a topic for 70. Learning how to follow the natural path and flow of mathematical derivations and calculations, even when you cannot see the end, is something important in 16AB. Thinking about the right level of generality and the proper perspective to establish something is a topic for 70. Understanding that there are patterns that have generality and the role of the right coordinates is something important in 16AB. Learning how to model uncertainty probabilistically is a topic for 70. Understanding that uncertainty needs to be modeled systematically and doing it linear algebraically is something important in 16AB. The list could go on and on. 16AB just do everything from an implicit &#34;pre-ML course&#34; perspective, but that&#39;s because if we&#39;re going to teach you these things, why not do it in a way that will help you long term.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Underneath everything though, there is a shift in perspective that is required. 70 implicitly assumes you have the attitude of someone who is in charge and helps you take charge\u00a0better. 16AB help by first liberating you from the chains you don&#39;t even know you&#39;re wearing. The struggles provoked by the HWs (and labs) in 16AB might seem different from those experienced by students facing the HWs in 70. And they are different. And they aren&#39;t different. (For example, struggling with &#34;what does this even mean?&#34;) But they grow your mental and <em><strong>emotional</strong></em> capacity to engage in these struggles. And this matters. It doesn&#39;t remove the struggle. It just makes you better able to engage in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this can seem like little comfort to a student whose concern, first and foremost, is with their letter grade in 70. But there has to be some degree of trust that actually understanding something well will probably help you with your grade.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-05-11T02:11:59Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jh1bt50w9dm5t9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "name": "Logan Howard", "photo": "1471912865_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hccnzx9ezt97j7/1471912865_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j2gnxx22okz5j8", "name": "Pranav Prakash", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1542387698, "j6bczj0pmoo4mk": 1512278032, "jaepthp7wf44nh": 1525327897, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1538161283, "jr1f3sutei62un": 1550805110, "jz2c8op4xqq4z3": 1576298894}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ixwrh8mz7qt1nn", "name": "Brian Hung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"iiklg7j9ggf2vl": 1, "ireb05q4pq01oe": 1, "ixtb5qkalsx6yo": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrimescdeo5hl", "name": "Michael Liang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lbakwzokh4ky", "name": "Justin Ryan Wong", "photo": "1507616797_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6lbakwzokh4ky/1507616797_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0slp1n9kt3u9", "name": "Jason Zhou", "photo": "1548118179_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iy0slp1n9kt3u9/1548118179_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p815tz306kj", "name": "Averal Kandala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6pa2e9c481b9", "name": "Ashwinee Panda", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "name": "Erick Quintanilla", "photo": "1471984816_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/irdxxfmolfj6tn/1471984816_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ixztbvf8dxv56m", "name": "Noah Alcus", "photo": "1509388352_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ixztbvf8dxv56m/1509388352_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ij4dmtwwm2u9", "name": "Eric Zhu", "photo": "1522609123_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6ij4dmtwwm2u9/1522609123_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewl384sd2tz", "name": "Ritwik Dixit", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100005394402714", "id": "hktwxo5q8h547h", "name": "Max Kanwal", "photo": "1523295706_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktwxo5q8h547h/1523295706_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hccnzx9ezt97j7", "j2gnxx22okz5j8", "ixwrh8mz7qt1nn", "idrimescdeo5hl", "j6lbakwzokh4ky", "iy0slp1n9kt3u9", "is6p815tz306kj", "is6pa2e9c481b9", "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "ixztbvf8dxv56m", "j6ij4dmtwwm2u9", "j6lewl384sd2tz", "hktwxo5q8h547h"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-10T23:55:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["16a", "cs-intended", "enrollments", "lscs", "peer_directed", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I read on another post that Professor Sahai was saying EE16AB were designed to be taken before CS70 to prepare students&#39; mathematical maturity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But from what I&#39;ve been hearing from other people, these EE courses don&#39;t have nearly as many proofs and the proofs to full credit on the exams are not nearly as extensive as the proofs in cs70.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m a rising sophomore and I just\u00a0finished cs61a and 61b this year.
