My friend works at Apple and didn&#39;t even take 189. Another friend got into AI/ML grad school at CMU without taking 189\u00a0lol. Relax. 67% of the class getting some sort of A is super generous and honestly I&#39;m surprised 189 doesn&#39;t follow every other EECS class which only gives out about 33% A&#39;s and A-&#39;s</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>There were multiple other issues in regards to this course like no HW Parties, not getting back HWs on a timely basis, among others. Like I said, this semester nearly 50% of the class apparently dropped the course. And the issue is that next semester the curve will be good again. It is fine if the curve doesn&#39;t fluctuate, but it is not\u00a0OK if it does. Someone that could have gotten an A in a previous semester might actually get a B&#43; this semester based on my calculations on the curve stats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That is simply not fair imo.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It&#39;s instructors right though. As a student who was also complaining on 189 piazza, spent days and nights doing all HWs,\u00a0 I would say there is no fair or unfiar, we also have the right to have taken it next semester but we didn&#39;t. I was hoping for a nice curve but don&#39;t think anybody is to blame. PS: to the anon below, I\u00a0also took hug&#39;s\u00a0 Fall 61B last semester and it seems I am so unlucky to face the two toughest curved semesters LOL</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>I agree^.\u00a0Think about\u00a0how Hug&#39;s students feel when they see their peers in Fall 61B getting &lt; 50% on all the exams but still getting A&#39;s and A&#43;&#39;s. Is it unfair? Probably. But that&#39;s\u00a0academia for you.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>There is still a big difference between 61B and 189. In 61B, they make it very clear what the curve would be. In 189 they purposely withheld that info. 61B is not a class whose grade determines whether you get that interview. This semester, Apple clearly stated they look at CS189 grades when determining if you get an interview. Very different scenarios.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>bruh did you not even read my first response. My friend works with\u00a0Apple&#39;s ML team and\u00a0<em>he didn&#39;t even take 189.\u00a0</em>That info session guy clearly didn&#39;t know what he was talking about</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It must be a new thing. There literally was a slide in the presentation that said this, and the main speaker talked about it during the presentation. It was very clearly not a matter of &#34;That info session guy clearly didn&#39;t know what he was talking about.&#34;</p>\n<p>________________________________________________-<br />I think people are being quite naive about this.<br />1. The grading follows departmental guidelines.<br />2. Its the instructor&#39;s right to assign grades the way they want and they are NOT OBLIGATED to follow previous semesters.<br /><br />You can express your disappointment all you want but I just wanted to say that you have no idea how the system works. In the Math department, the difference between two professors teaching is not 45% As vs. 67% As but rather whether you even pass the course. I would venture to say that professor Sahai gave grades that no other professor has given for any mainstream undergrad class in the department. Therefore, it doesn&#39;t make sense to expect the same from other professors teaching the course.<br /><br />I understand getting that stellar A/A&#43; might be important for getting ML research. But apart from that, I don&#39;t think Apple or any other company even checks your transcript. Moreover, Apple doesn&#39;t hold infosessions, they have a &#34;networking day&#34; so not sure which infosession you&#39;re talking about which only you seem to have gone to.<br />Lastly, and again, the staff is NOT obligated to provide homework parties or Piazza support. Just because such extensive support is imparted to us in the lowerdiv EECS classes does not entitle us for the same in the upperdivs.<br /><br />tl;dr I think there&#39;s more to life (even if ML is your life) than getting an A in 189. I think companies definitely care more about your projects/experience.

Good luck studying!&#34; As a student who had spent\u00a0many many\u00a0hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong and why I couldn&#39;t make sense of the solutions, I found this extremely frustrating and enraging.\u00a0In my opinion, it would have been better to not give any solutions at all than to publish incorrect ones -- how were we to know if we were doing the problem wrong or if the solution was just wrong??

Also, 2 of our 10 homework assignments still haven&#39;t been graded! I would think they should keep our piazza active until all of the HWs have been graded in case anyone has questions about their grades or about the rubric...
