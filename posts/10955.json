My brother went down that route and he did not double major, only did one major and had a relatively low GPA (&lt;3.0).

The thing is, he was really involved with clubs\u00a0and led some student orgs. while in college. I think for a PM sort of role, they are mainly looking for experiences that you had outside of class doing management/leadership type work, since your classes in college don&#39;t really prepare you for PM stuff (whereas one could argue that the CS major does prepare you for engineering roles).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-12-14T21:20:59Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-12-14T17:05:55Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k45u0jkuyhb137", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I&#39;m a senior, but I have not gone down the DS/ML path so take my advice with a grain of salt. In my experience, doing a double major is almost useless for getting a job. Employers don&#39;t really care that you satisfied the graduation requirements for two different majors. You will get far more out of, and build a more impressive resume, by doing clubs/working. This seems especially true if you want to be a PM where you don&#39;t really learn any of those skills in school. I would recommend taking the DS classes that interest you and that seem important for your career, but don&#39;t get bogged down taking classes just to add a bullet point to your resume.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-12-14T17:05:55Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10580": 0, "3744": 2, "4673": 6, "628": 4, "6667": 8, "7069": 5, "7998": 1, "9052": 3, "9825": 7}}, "created": "2019-12-14T06:30:55Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi, I am a CS sophomore who is planning to enter industry after graduation.
