I can change it to a P/NP or drop it after the regular add/drop or P/NP deadline - as long as it&#39;s before the late drop deadline. This change is essentially guaranteed, as long as it&#39;s not because you were caught cheating. If you drop below the 13-unit floor, however, it may affect your financial aid, international student status, etc. (see the form for details). You dropping below the 13-unit floor will not affect whether or not the class gets dropped. You can also make a second request within the same semester, but I don&#39;t know if this second change is guaranteed (I would assume it isn&#39;t). After the semester ends, you cannot make any more requests (I guess you technically could, but they&#39;ll all be ignored).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re trying to make a change in your schedule now, it won&#39;t be possible, since the deadline was last Friday (12/08), before 4pm.</p>", "created": "2017-12-11T08:33:45Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jb1xyh73bty2f4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2018_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2017_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2016_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "transfers_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz09kuypy023cn", "name": "Lily Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hz09kuypy023cn"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-11T08:04:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Where is the link to the new policy about changing PNP past the deadline</p>", "created": "2017-12-11T08:04:13Z", "subject": "PNP policy", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jb1wwi2fcme5an", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5749, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550569142, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 462}
