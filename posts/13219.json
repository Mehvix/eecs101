Not in the way 54 and 70 are 61A are hard - where its a lot of work but relatively narrow and defined concepts that you can get a lot of practice on. 126 and 127 are classes that require, in my opinion, a significant amount of comfort with the basics of probability and linear algebra and even with that can take around 10-15 hours a week to truly complete the homework (which you need to do to have a solid enough understanding to do well on the tests). They cover a lot of content very quickly and they offer significantly less support than lower divisions. If you still want to take both and 61B, I highly recommend you make sure you have a good study group before going into all of these classes because you will probably need the support as things heat up. Also, make sure their midterms and finals don&#39;t fall on the same day/time, this happened to a few people I knew.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbe583ezwhe2fb", "name": "Smit Dagli", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbe583ezwhe2fb"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-10-08T01:55:13Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10585": 1, "10664": 6, "10755": 2, "12093": 8, "2809": 5, "5201": 0, "5272": 9, "5397": 3, "6414": 4, "9723": 7}}, "created": "2020-10-04T19:53:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m planning to take 61B, EECS 126 and 127, and a 1 unit decal/seminar this Spring.
