If you apply right out of undergrad, you will be matched up against candidates that also have only a Bachelors degree. However, by doing the 5th year Masters you will be compared to other candidates with a Masters degree. This may put you at a disadvantage considering that the 5th year program is only 2 semesters where as other Masters programs are 4 semesters long, meaning that the other candidates may have more time to build out their research experience and get publications. I would recommend only pursuing the 5th year Masters program if you know that a PhD is not something you want to consider in the future. Of course, it can be done to do a 5th Year Masters and get into an elite PhD program, but it does have its challenges.</p>", "created": "2020-10-21T01:53:41Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "kgiqt5uigd64al", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10194": 0, "10411": 9, "1065": 2, "11552": 7, "11988": 1, "12152": 6, "12432": 3, "4480": 5, "7461": 4, "9630": 8}}, "created": "2020-10-20T05:25:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "suggestion_box", "faculty_advising", "research"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a senior right now who would like to apply for grad school.
