I&#39;m a rising junior and I am considering the taking the above course load and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the manageability of it. I do have some other commitments (I&#39;m in a club and accepted a tutor position for a lower div course), but I&#39;m fairly set on taking 3 techs this semester as I&#39;m almost completely done with my breadths and would like to save some for senior year and I&#39;m really interested in all of these courses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I figure 161 shouldn&#39;t be too heavy, but I&#39;m mainly concerned about 162 and 126/164. Which one of 126 and 164 would be more manageable with 162? I know 164 is generally very heavy, but Hilfinger isn&#39;t teaching it this semester so I heard it&#39;s a bit lighter. I have already taken 170 and 186 and completed all lower divs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d appreciate any thoughts people have on this.
