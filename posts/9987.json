I do know of a lot of people who go this route, and it certainly works for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, the most engaging and useful internships I got did not come from any of those places.\u00a0Find a domain that you are really interested in, and do some work in it. I don&#39;t think &#34;full-stack software engineer&#34; or &#34;ML engineer&#34; counts as a domain. For example, rather than applying to every &#34;ML engineer intern&#34; position under the sun, focus on learning Spark MLLib and working with Scala, see what paradigms and abstractions are actually used to deploy machine learning models in industry with this stack, and find companies that use that stack (they are more of them, and they are often bigger companies than you may think).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The best domains are such that there are maybe 10 people in the world that can mentor you and really care about this domain. These 10 passionate people often find themselves looking for people to collaborate with, and they often find themselves in SF/bay area, and they often find themselves at meetups related to their domains of expertise.\u00a0I don&#39;t mean big tech company infosessions (which from my experience are basically just big marketing events), I mean programming language, open-source project, etc. meetups.\u00a0I remember going to meetup talks and at the end some speakers would literally say &#34;we&#39;re hiring, come talk to me if you&#39;re interested&#34;. In my experience, once you find these people and show that you&#39;re serious, it becomes surprisingly easy to get an internship. There are many people passionate about specific technologies and use-cases, and they love working with similar people.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p95tfsldfi", "updated": "2019-08-09T00:22:46Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-08T18:56:46Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What does the term recruiting even mean?
