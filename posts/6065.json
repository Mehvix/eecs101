I took CS 160 and thought it was amazingly useful; no one will buy or use software that they can&#39;t figure out how to use. It teaches a completely different side of CS and in my opinion it should be a required course. If you have zero-interest in front-end systems or human computer interaction, it may not be the best class to take, but beyond that it is 100% a great class to take. I can&#39;t speak to how the particular workload you mentioned is, but 160 itself varies. I thought the workload was pretty light and very manageable, but it does vary from semester to semester.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tldr; yes, it&#39;s very useful and you should take it.</p>", "created": "2018-01-17T23:08:08Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ib2kjonsu611tu"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I heard that CS160 is in the running for either the worst or second least valuable upper div CS course at Cal.
