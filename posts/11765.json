Regardless of which one I choose, I plan on taking 189 as my second tech. To provide a bit of context for my decision, I&#39;m going to be a junior next year and am hoping to get into some form of ML research as soon as possible (since I&#39;ve heard labs are hesitant to recruit seniors) so I want to get done with 189 early on. In this regard, some students have recommended I take 127 with 189 since a lot of the optimization concepts overlap and allow you to get more practice in as well as build a more solid base. On the other hand, I&#39;ve been postponing taking 61C for a long while and I&#39;m hesitant to push it back even further since it&#39;s a core lower-division class (although my interests do not lie in that sub-field of CS). Moreover, taking 127 the semester after 189 would allow me to focus more on the class (since most of my time next semester will likely be consumed by 189) and ensure that I get a better grade (which may be important for ML research since the course is relevant to the field).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An important thing to note is that, considering the notoriety of Professor Sahai&#39;s iteration of 189, I intend to self-study both 127 and 189 during summer anyways. By doing so, I hope I can familiarize myself with enough of the course content to make up for the fact that I didn&#39;t take 127 before 189 (as the professor recommends). I&#39;m currently taking 170 and 126 (with good grades in both) so I should be covered on that end.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Considering the above, which option would people recommend? Should I go with 61C &#43; 189 or 127 &#43; 189?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks for all the help in advance!</p>", "created": "2020-04-12T05:10:16Z", "subject": "61C &#43; 189 vs 127 &#43; 189?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k8wlaf9fd9v3jw", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11765, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544079784, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jyq487ctcwuk8": 1576702519}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jl5gfwcvxxp6mr", "name": "Jessica Yu", "photo": "1576804504_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jl5gfwcvxxp6mr/1576804504_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jl5gfwcvxxp6mr"], "tags": ["faculty_advising", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 543}
