seriously think you want to do a phd program then you should take it depends on the company but for most tech companies they probably aren&#39;t going to care esp if you tell them you&#39;re doing research vs reneging on them for another company which would be bm but the reality is good engineers are hard to find so a company who holds grudges in recruiting is going to have a tough time really i mean it there is no way that reneging on an intern offer is going to affect your area of research maybe in hardware hardware people are kind of old school but in software stuff no way and in ai or ml stuff talent is just too hard to find\n\nnow if you are a sophomore just chill out do the internship because it&#39;s probably your first real experience in industry and for most people the industry life is a good life and is the right thing for them because research is hard it&#39;s overworked and underappreciated and industry pays well and they give you hella perks so just do the internship maybe think about doing (3)\n\noverall your best plan is probably (3) because it&#39;s least bm and doing research during the summer when you aren&#39;t doing anything else is a big deal because you can actually spend 40-60 hours a week but good luck doing more than 10 hours a week of research during the school year if you don&#39;t clear out your schedule and want to do any extracurriculars it&#39;s just hard homie \n\ngood luck phd grind is hard</md>", "created": "2020-03-05T06:20:50Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k7ed2stzcm15a8", "is_tag_endorse": false,
