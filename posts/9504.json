I was an instructor last Fall and I found it a great experience to pass on advice to the incoming freshman class. In terms of time commitment, you simply have to meet with your section (consisting of 15-20 students) once a week for 1 hour. Lesson plans are already pre-made so no content creation is necessary.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Original Post:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Want to share your knowledge of navigating the world of Berkeley engineering with incoming students? Become an instructor for Engineering 98 for the Fall 2019 semester! Engineering 98 is a one unit, P/NP DeCal class that was designed by upper division engineering students to help freshmen get the most out of Berkeley engineering.
