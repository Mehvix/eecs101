I kind of regret my decision for not taking the class. In retrospect, this class is very important topic in engineering in general so it&#39;s cross listed under both ME and EE. Right now as I&#39;m doing research that requires some knowledge of control, I feel that I would be more equipped had I taken this class. Since control pops up in all kinds of engineering problems and other classes, it is very valuable to have some exposure to it in case you encounter it in the future.

But it definitely kills your chances if some jobs require knowledge of control obviously. \n\n----\n\nSomeone who has taken the class (with Fearing if it matters) here. I&#39;m interested in robotics and analog circuits, and it turns out both of those really depend on the ideas of stability, tracking error, disturbance rejection, and the ability to use feedback to control those things. You gain some powerful tools to analyze and optimize feedback systems. 105 and 140 do cover the part of 128 that relates directly to amplifier design, but not so well, so without 128 the relevant material ends up feeling a little like magic you have to remember rather than tools you can use. \n\nAlso, the labs are cool multi-week projects (magnetic levitation, inverted pendulum swing-up) which qualify the course to count as your design requirement, yet when I took the class my group didn&#39;t have to work on the labs outside of lab hours at all, besides of course prelabs and writing the reports. The workload besides that wasn&#39;t light, but wasn&#39;t too heavy either.\n\nSo I think it&#39;s a very cost-effective (in terms of work input) class, assuming of course you&#39;re interested in areas where it&#39;s relevant.", "created": "2016-04-01T04:02:22Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hktxrf6f7xi35i"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I did not take the class so anyone else please feel free to add to this response.
