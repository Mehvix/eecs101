I&#39;d say that the written homework was mostly straightforward, although some questions could be rather tricky. Expect to spend maybe 8 hours on each set (they are due about every two weeks). The labs will be where you will spend the bulk of your time, and, last spring, there was generally a huge variance in how long they took. Lab 2 (FireSim) took me around 25 or 30 hours, mostly because the simulations took forever to run and the report expected a <em>lot</em> of data from these simulations. Other labs took anywhere from 5 to 15 hours, and the length really depended on the concept. A lot of the concepts covered in 152 require a lot of practice in order to build familiarity, so I&#39;d also say that you should plan to put aside a lot of time to study for the exams. The student population is rather self-selected (i.e. more than half of the students are 61C TAs or could be if they wanted to), so the exam distributions are a bit... unusual... and the curve is pretty harsh considering that.</p>", "created": "2019-10-21T22:21:39Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj"}], "id": "k20zikrt5ss4j2", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p714o9ug5tk", "name": "Jonathan Lee", "photo": "1539938294_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p714o9ug5tk/1539938294_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jpslgn3m4lsk6": 1555223627, "ke0mwss5bxj4hs": 1600242896}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhobhold1yokb", "name": "Kaushik Sankar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6y4cble5r5", "name": "Dinesh Parimi", "photo": "1536104810_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6y4cble5r5/1536104810_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6leveby1z321w", "name": "Bernard Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jgzrvhr0eop6on", "name": "Vidhan Jain", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j4i5gu5n66420l", "name": "Neil Kulkarni", "photo": "1568090726_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j4i5gu5n66420l/1568090726_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jkp12vta3zd1yt", "name": "Rohan Koodli", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p714o9ug5tk", "jhobhold1yokb", "is6p6y4cble5r5", "j6leveby1z321w", "jgzrvhr0eop6on", "j4i5gu5n66420l", "jkp12vta3zd1yt", "j6gtkkw4sr227", "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-21T21:05:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "cs-intended", "lscs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Can anyone comment on the workload of CS 152?
