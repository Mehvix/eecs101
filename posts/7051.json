The application asks for a Spoken English test score of the following types: iBT (TOEFL), OPT, and SPEAK. However, I have not completed any of these tests.\u00a0\n\n\nI have taken some English tests that I think may be able to replace the need to use scores from these exams, such as the IELTS, SAT, and IB (International Baccalaureate) exams. Would it be possible to use these tests to fulfill the non-native speaker requirement? If so, how should it be specified on the application?
