I didn&#39;t know 370 was not counted as a technical elective yet, so in the spot where it asks you to list your planned classes to see if you will graduate on time I put that on there-- I still might have put 2 other valid tech electives so I should be good, but honestly I&#39;m really not sure. Also, I think you had to\u00a0say the number of units you have taken so far (I think including this semester) and since then, I late dropped a math class so the unit count is also inaccurate.
