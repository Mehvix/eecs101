Agree with the above answer. A disturbing trend in the class is the tendency for homework problems to use some special linear algebra &#34;trick&#34; that most students have never heard of. The TAs will tell folks in office hours, and it will trickle down via their friends but not very well (imagine messed-up LaTeX telephone). So everyone is agonizing over a single problem for hours until 24 hours before the deadline when Prof. el Ghaoui releases the hint on a bCourses announcement.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps Prof. Bayen may be a better lecturer, he has great reviews on RMP. I&#39;m not sure how much the GSIs (not uGSIs!) can improve at teaching because a) a lot of this material is easy for them as they&#39;re grad students at Berkeley, and b) they aren&#39;t particularly incentivized to spend a lot of time teaching instead of doing research, because, well, they&#39;re grad students at Berkeley and teaching isn&#39;t their primary job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think the material is super super interesting (not just for ML!) and if you&#39;re able to devote a lot of time to the class you&#39;ll get a lot out of it. But it can be frustrating to not have the same &#34;structure&#34; that 61A/B/70/170/126 gives you.</p>", "created": "2018-04-10T23:33:15Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Yeah, 127 isn&#39;t well run.\u00a0Personally, I don&#39;t think the lectures go\u00a0over the important parts of the material, and the discussion worksheets and homework problems seem to just require\u00a0unrelated tricks.
