Maybe not at the undergraduate level though. If you&#39;ve taken 184 they talk about this, but you can view an image as a signal. The same signal processing operations done on images (DCT compression, filtering of various types, etc) are based in signals, and while I haven&#39;t done a pure computer vision course yet (hoping to take the grad level one next semester), as you can see from <a href=\"https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs280/sp18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>\u00a0they use signal/frequency representations in later lectures. Not the core course to take if you&#39;re interested in computer vision at the undergraduate level, but it would be useful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a systems person, probably not too useful though, though computer vision isn&#39;t career-useful as a systems person either. I do find it a good class, especially with Babak (he&#39;s great). It also is basically an intro course to a whole half of EE, so you get that exposure, and those kind of intro courses are also paradigm-building in the sense that they can shape how you analyze stuff. So like totally, take it if you want. But career benefits for a systems person, you&#39;d be better off with EE 122 (the EE version of 168).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re looking for classes in EE in general that will help with systems, maybe the stuff at the border of EE and CS, like 149, might be more career beneficial.
