I recently started doing some research through URAP and am currently working with ~17,000 images to train a CNN classifier for them. The problem is that at the moment I am training the classifier using my personal laptop (an XPS 15) and hence even with such a (relatively small) dataset, it takes quite a while for it to train. Hence, whenever I try changing the hyperparameters to see which ones best suit my data, I have to wait a really long time before I can get the results, which is slowing down my research quite a bit. Moreover, to be able to train the CNN for a sufficient number of epochs that results in substantial accuracy (around ~100 epochs for my needs), I have to keep my laptop running the entire day and night. I&#39;m worried that having my GPU constantly working for such a large period of time will lead to the device getting damaged and that would be disastrous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hence, I was wondering if Berkeley had any freely available resources (such as servers we could ssh into) that were built for such tasks (CUDA enabled GPUs, etc.)? That way, I could simply train my CNN using those resources which should greatly speed up my tasks and even allow me to rest my own laptop&#39;s GPU.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, for people who are working in such fields, what would you recommend as the best paid (cheap/efficient/etc) option that we could use to train CNNs with? In the case that the university doesn&#39;t have any free resources, I am thinking of requesting my professor to allocate some funds that we could use to rent servers on which we could train our model.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m really sorry if this is kind of a trivial question for those in the field, or if I&#39;m missing something really obvious. It&#39;s just that this is my first time doing research at the university, especially in the ML field, and I&#39;m really not sure what resources I have available to use.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2019-11-02T21:34:20Z", "subject": "Berkeley Resources for Training CNN", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k2i33y9kya34vc", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10716, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545389165, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["peer_directed", "research", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 430}
