I have not taken 160 before but I think it&#39;s more like a for senior only class because of the waitlist. If you want to explore more EE, I recommend EE105 or EE130. After that, you are pretty sure if you want to touch EE at all as an EECS major. (Plenty of EECS majors can&#39;t solder.) If you like math and signal stuff, EE120 is a great class to take if you consider yourself &#39;advanced&#39; in your math ability. For CS side, I don&#39;t have much experience but I can at least speak about CS188, CS170, CS162 and EECS149. I don&#39;t think you should try CS188 and CS170 without knowledge in CS70. The pace of the classes is pretty fast so you better have a solid foundation. Take CS162 if you are ready for quite a lot of work and you like CS61C type material. If you want more coding training and a SW summer internship, take a coding part time job. \u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "hl00cn6zc056e6", "updated": "2015-10-13T21:19:23Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2015-10-13T21:36:36Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>CS 160, CS 168 / EE 122, CS 169, CS 186, CS 162, CS 164 (lots of work)</p>", "created": "2015-10-13T21:36:36Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "ifpw29razxd44o", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2015-10-13T21:58:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>The above student gave a pretty comprehensive list of courses that don&#39;t *require* EE16B or CS70, but I wanted to add that you may also want to avoid the heavier courses since you&#39;d be taking 3 technicals in one term. \u00a0This would distill the list to CS160, 168, and 186. \u00a0</p>", "created": "2015-10-13T21:58:24Z", "subject": "", "uid": "halg8jo1i9m2ye"}], "id": "ifpwuadjb0z64z", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzd1lb5fiuc2sq"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-10-13T20:44:42Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>What are some EECS upper division courses that I would be fine with taking EE16B and CS70 concurrently with?
