If you do take 189, there&#39;s not as much reason to take Data 100 since it seems like after 189 you mainly just learn common data science tools like pandas, etc. in Data 100.

As far as opening up many options for industry, if you take 189, 123, 126, 127, with the classes you are taking now, you would have a really good foundation for ML/signals/theory etc., but you will have only taken 162 (possibly 161) as your SWE-focused courses.

Everything is incorporating ML, so while 189 might be overkill in terms of amount of content, you wont get enough background in any other class to consider yourself on top of ML. Part of the core of all mathy CS is 126 and 127. This includes ML, robotics, signals and systems, and more, as everything is probabilistic, and with the combination of many variables and error in all values, you need linear algebra and optimization. 123 is called by the professor the &#34;swiss army knife&#34; of EECS.

I will say 100 isn&#39;t that important if you&#39;ve taken the other stuff. I took 100 after 189 and I knew everything but how to use Pandas and Seaborn (python libraries for data manipulation (similar to SQL) and graphing). 186 is actually really important for any kind of stuff that requires a ton of data like ML as you need a way to actually work with the data. I&#39;d say 161 is also really important for anyone programming products or systems, but as a transfer student trying to prioritize, 161 and 186 wouldn&#39;t be the highest for me compared to the others you listed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I actually would disagree with the advice below to specialize unless you know what you want, especially when it comes to ML. You could do data science easily out of college with 189, but real specialized jobs often require more education; that&#39;s why classes like computer vision and NLP are grad classes at the moment. In general, I wouldn&#39;t recommend a grad class as a transfer student just because of time. If you wanna take them, go to grad school, where you have to specialize anyways. The exception to this would be taking at least one looks good on grad apps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will also disagree with the idea that 106a teaches controls at all.
