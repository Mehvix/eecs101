Does that mean that I can also declare the data science minor in Fall 2019 if it gets approved (or would it only be available to declare in Spring 2020)? I am asking since I will be a senior next year and Fall 2019 would be my last semester to declare a minor, so I would like to enroll in courses based on whether I have a chance to declare the minor. Also, what are the chances of the minor actually getting approved in Fall 2019 and not being postponed again?</p>", "created": "2019-04-26T04:40:27Z", "subject": "Data Science Minor", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "juxl88h01uw63t", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9380, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546836043, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 262}
