If you want to be an industry data scientist, you should do it. While 186 will be involved, I doubt its scope is exactly what you&#39;ll do, and to my knowledge, it doesn&#39;t cover NoSQL and other common database systems. Moreover, it&#39;s really hard to say what helps for &#39;ML&#39; in context of jobs. Often these awesome jobs are really code for making test software or basic software engineering with little independent ML work. In those cases, an industry co-op is far more productive for you than any one course. For a deeper perspective on ML, I&#39;d strongly suggest a graduate cs course, something if not several of the CS 27X series of courses.\n\nBut again, this school and how you navigate it is an approximation technique. If you want to be a ML engineer, it&#39;s far more productive to sit down and be rigorous about reading through several textbooks [start with Intro to Statistical Learning], papers and tutorials, and then make projects. If you want to develop new aspects of machine and deep learning, take a few courses on stats, differential geometry and real analysis [CS70/EECS 126 TA and general superstar Sinho Chewi has a website where he hosts notes from various stats-oriented math courses, which I strongly recommend reading through, and using as a guide to further questions you might have].", "created": "2018-07-17T20:02:00Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jjq4j9nm2ykh5", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jr1f3sutei62un": 1556178456, "jr6wgkg4hqh19q": 1557799886}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6n7jp86zpw1kc", "name": "Siyi Ren", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"global": 1, "imm91o6q8qv5hg": 1, "is758hjb2yo2sy": 1, "ixwkta02en780": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy7g0roh1q3", "name": "Aditya Baradwaj", "photo": "1455863575_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/icguy7g0roh1q3/1455863575_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1542387698, "j6bczj0pmoo4mk": 1512278032, "jaepthp7wf44nh": 1525327897, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1538161283, "jr1f3sutei62un": 1550805110, "jz2c8op4xqq4z3": 1576298894}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ixwrh8mz7qt1nn", "name": "Brian Hung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6n7jp86zpw1kc", "icguy7g0roh1q3", "ixwrh8mz7qt1nn"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-18T13:36:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjr676f8i3m12p", "subject": "A point to make is that this advice mostly applies to statistical machine learning, and although this stuff is good for deep learning, the priorities are different; probably after 189 check out the Deep Learning book.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2018-07-18T13:36:21Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-18T13:34:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjr64edqgp3j1", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Mostly agree with anon, but a few points I&#39;d make\n- CS27x series are mostly theoretical computer science (more like advanced algorithms) and might not be the best use of your time, 294 courses might be more useful\n- After 189 you actually don&#39;t need to go through Intro to Statistical Learning (I think), you could probably go straight into Elements of Statistical Learning\n- Math classes are great, I know that for stats phd program (including those in statistical machine learning) like seeing courses such as 104 because it is as fundamental to advanced theoretical areas as calculus is to most engineering areas.
