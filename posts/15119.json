The form asks me to put down the name of my major advisor, and I&#39;m not sure whose name I should write. I have two majors (the form allows me to put down both), and there are multiple advisors in each major, but the form only asks for one name, so I&#39;m not sure what to do. I&#39;ve already booked a Wednesday appointment with a CS advisor through CalCentral, but any help here is appreciated as well.
