We all have experienced not getting into the majors, the jobs, or the clubs that we work so hard for. This week is an opportunity for our community to come together to foster a more welcoming and inclusive environment! <br /><br />If you are interested, we have several different events LIVE on our Facebook Page <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eecscommunityweek/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.facebook.com/eecscommunityweek/</a> categorized into academic-related events and wellness events! Please consider going to one or more events to support the cause!<br /><br />We also have one-on-one mentorship session planned for the week! These sessions are central to EE/CS Community Week. If you are interested in being a mentor: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forms.gle/wVJMqhv7SXu4rCJs6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://forms.gle/wVJMqhv7SXu4rCJs6</a>.
