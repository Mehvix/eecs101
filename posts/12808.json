I&#39;ve heard that what people found more useful from CS 70 is the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34;, and as much as I hate that term being used for gatekeeping from upper divs, I somewhat agree. If you haven&#39;t taken 70, then maybe it&#39;d be beneficial to take EECS 16B since that provides this so called &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; while also teaching you concepts that will be useful for 127.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t know why you are facing that enrollment issue.
