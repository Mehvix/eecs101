It takes into account the fact that this is a very difficult semester, so if you <i>do</i> need to count this semester&#39;s performance into the average, then you deserve to have the bar be slightly lower (I like having it at ~3.1) to make up for all the trouble this time around. And then if you want to throw away this semester&#39;s performance completely, the P/NP is there too.

I did not know where else to post this, so I thought making this new post was appropriate.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because of the unexpected rise of COVID-19, our academic experience has been compromised. This affects our academics and learning abilities (not to mention academic performance) greatly, as clearly acknowledged with the P/NP grading option announcement for Spring 2020.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I understand that this will affect the 3.3 GPA declaration cap for L&amp;S. For that I have a suggestion. I understand I am just a student but I firmly believe that we all have a voice and I hope someone reads this.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My proposed solution:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A student can choose to P/NP <b>ONE</b>\u00a0of the major declaration classes that they are <strong>CURRENTLY</strong> in (i.e. CS61B if the student is in CS61B right now). If the student is in <strong>multiple</strong> major declaration classes (i.e. CS 61B and CS 70) they have the option of using P/NP on still only <strong>ONE</strong> of those classes, so the other must be taken for a letter grade (i.e. Student is in 61B and 70, but chooses to P/NP 61B while taking 70 for a letter grade). Now, since the student has at least<strong> two\u00a0</strong>of the three major declaration prerequisites taken for a letter grade, they must meet a 3.3 GPA with those two letter graded classes.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now the other part of my solution, if a student chooses to <strong>not</strong> use a P/NP option this semester for their major declaration class (i.e. student chooses <strong>not</strong> to P/NP 61B this semester, and take it for a letter grade), then they must meet a 3.2 GPA threshold with all three prerequisite classes to declare the major. If someone is in two major declaration pre-requisite classes, and elect <strong>NOT</strong> to use a P/NP for <strong>EITHER</strong> one of those courses, then all three of the prerequisites will be used to calculate if they reach a 3.2 GPA threshold. If they choose to P/NP one of those classes, then see the scenario in the previous paragraph.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once again, by no means am I chastising anyone, trying to shade anybody nor any any party involved. Quite frankly kudos to the EECS department for handling themselves with organization and finesse in such a panic-driven time. I am offering my suggestion and I mean <strong>all</strong> <strong>the respect in the world</strong> to the faculty and staff who work hard in the EECS department.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know the EECS department is working hard and I hate to be an add-on with this post, but I wanted to express my opinion.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you and stay healthy :)\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-03-21T05:44:13Z", "subject": "Suggestion to the EECS Department regarding GPA Cap", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k816tc987gi6ka", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11546, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544324549, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdiubjnch4r0", "name": "Joseph Ryan Garay", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdifiy1ch4hy", "name": "Nitin Bhupatiraju", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr5jsnz4mil540", "name": "Kathleen Kong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jl5txghyz3t6dr", "name": "Brandy Nguyen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpob42gs2jz", "name": "Albert Su", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1572839448_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1572839448_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzmxfhaex9yto": 1574281407, "k5cww7u4ca46ve": 1585042010}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr10lbajldlya", "name": "Aayush", "photo": "1581230766_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jr10lbajldlya/1581230766_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jykoiw12p0p400", "name": "Prachi Deo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1581703162_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1581703162_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzqdiubjnch4r0", "jzqdifiy1ch4hy", "jr5jsnz4mil540", "jl5txghyz3t6dr", "jzlnpob42gs2jz", "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "jr10lbajldlya", "jykoiw12p0p400", "jktvhcjpozd5xg"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "lscs", "policy", "student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 735}
