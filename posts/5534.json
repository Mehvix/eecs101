I asked Professor Sahai this very question at faculty advising this semester and he said 120/123 are more important for signal processing (along with 126/127); 118 doesn&#39;t hurt to add on but most likely there&#39;s more important classes to take than 118 so you should\u00a0probably prioritize other stuff above 118.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally,\u00a0as someone who&#39;s taking 120 now and 123 next semester and has wondered this too, I&#39;ve looked into 118 and it\u00a0seems\u00a0like more of the math perspective on Fourier Analysis (i.e. how sines and cosines are an uncountable basis for L2) and some added stuff on wavelets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, overall, I&#39;d say take 120/123 for sure, add 118 if you have time. The consensus seems to be that 110 is the most important math upper div of all in general though.
