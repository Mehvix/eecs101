And now I am running out of time to take all the classes I feel like I need to take to lay the foundation for my interests.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think I have enough of a foundation in software engineering with CS170, CS162, CS168, and planning on taking CS161 next semester and I believe I will be able to learn a lot on the job that I have lined up.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That being said, I now have an interest in getting more into Machine Learning, AI and Data Science and going to grad school in the future for Stats or CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I wanted to take CS189 next semester (I have taken CS188, Math 54, Math 53, EE16A), but I have been reading that EECS 126 and EECS127 are very very important, and I think Professor Sahai even said that having those under your belt, you can self-study 189.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So would it be more beneficial for my future if I took 126 and 127 instead of 189 next semester?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally,\u00a0I am also planning on taking the Game Design/Development Decal which I heard can take up quite a bit of time as well. If I end up having to pick just one between EE126 and EE127\u00a0, which one do you guys think will be better?</p>\n<p>(I really do not wish to overload my schedule with too much coursework as I do want to spend some meaningful time in the non-academic/career-focused aspects of life that we tend to neglect in my last semester of college.\u00a0hopefully it doesn&#39;t come to this but I am not sure what the work load for these classes are like so any input here would be very helpful too!)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sorry for the very long message and thank you for any input/advice anyone can provide me!
