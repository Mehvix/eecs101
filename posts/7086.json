It is wise advice and I agree completely, he is not pulling out of nowhere. There is real value to this and you will definitely get so much more out of cs189 and learn/understand the material more by taking those other courses. Especially with the revamped curriculum this is even more true now than back when I took it.\u00a0There is real benefit and payoff to learning/understanding the material, it will help you achieve more and make more meaningful contributions. Also cs189 is grueling enough already, taking those other courses will help prepare you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The brutally honest flip side is, unfortunately, learning is sometimes not the only priority (or, gasp, even the top priority &gt;_&lt;). As some of my friends sometimes put it, &#34;just putting the 5 characters &#39;cs189&#39; on your resume&#34; is immensely helpful. The same people in academia and industry who extoll the virtues of the slow route, of taking the background classes first, will not even look at you unless you take cs189. At the same time they will reward bad behavior if you are strong and intelligent enough to get away with it and survive cs189 earlier. Resumes and research are cumulative and the more experience you can stack in the beginning, the further ahead you will get along. If you&#39;re trying to go into industry, there&#39;s immense pressure to get as much as experience as possible, and if you&#39;re trying to go into research or academia, there is immense pressure to publish as much as possible. And the earlier you start either the better.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will warn that there are tremendous risks with this &#34;fake it until you make it&#34; approach, and there are real drawbacks to having weak fundamentals and holes in your understanding. It will not help you at all to take cs189 early if you get a bad grade in it (or, to be real here, less than an A. And with the grade inflation in recent semesters, maybe even A&#43;). There is a very real possibility of the entire scheme backfiring terribly on you. But that is par for the course for a shortcut.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One disclaimer is that clubs like <a href=\"mailto:ML&#64;B\">ML&#64;B</a>\u00a0and other related developments\u00a0were still in their infancy back in my day, so cs189 might not be as much of a sacred gate as it used to be. But I imagine much of this is still true.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ultimately I would still very much recommend Sahai&#39;s advice, but out of the honesty from my experience as a student, I would like to put some of the other realities of the situation out there for you to consider as well. It all depends on your priorities, what you want to accomplish, what your limits and constraints are, and your appetite for risk.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2018-05-26T03:29:25Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/20 - 5/26", "bucket_order": 96, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-27T06:28:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhog0n34mtg60z", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Disclaimer: This post is meant to address concerns about going deeper into ML research rather than learning intro ML.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hi, a lot of the posts on piazza repeatedly always focus on taking on courses as the way to go - I always wanted to address this sort of mentality, but never knew how to put it in words well, so here goes:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I recently just looked over my former childhood stuff just for nostalgia, and these blog posts caught my eye again:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1352h1021967_stuff_on_how_to_learn_contest_math_feedback_please\" target=\"_blank\">Post 1</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1352h1040727_on_contest_math_higher_math_understanding_and_other_things\" target=\"_blank\">Post 2</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1352h1025748_something_i_posted_on_the_woot_boards\" target=\"_blank\">Post 3</a></p>\n<p>(these are made by a young David Yang with his Putnam Fellow/bunches of papers on algebraic geometry, arguably the one person in our generation who can contend against Terrance Tao&#39;s record) - The common bottleneck back in HS was that there were some people who could qualify for this one math olympiad, but suddenly almost everybody fails miserably at the olympiad when it&#39;s just 3 problems for 4.5 hours for 2 days. And this wouldn&#39;t be solved by teaching everybody more &#34;material&#34; or drilling more common problems, which was a common mistake for improvement. It&#39;s not just math olympiads; this bottleneck exists in a lot of activities (chess, gaming, whatever).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Essentially, he argues the problem with focusing so much on &#34;fundamentals&#34; is that it&#39;s not a great indicator of very deep intuition or &#34;larger picture&#34; thinking. Even if you took all of the courses noted above, it doesn&#39;t have much of a correlation with someone&#39;s ability to read papers &#34;flowingly&#34;, or be able to make beautiful connections between subjects. And this has been shown empirically many times, where someone with 10000 A&#43;&#39;s can really falter at making creative ideas, or when a strong physics/biology PhD who has no clue about ML ends up doing a lot of impressive work in ML research when given the opportunity (ex.
