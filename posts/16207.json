One balloon (Let\u2019s called NU6XB-11), rose up to the cloudy sky and was not heard from (more on that soon). The second balloon (called NU6XB-13) was released a few minutes after. But a gust of wind pushed it to the eucalyptus trees east of Cory, where it got stuck!.<br /><br />On Friday, a rescue operation using drone was able to recover the tracker (NU6XB-13), it was attached to a new balloon that was re-launched at 4pm in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the drone was caught in the trees and remained there till it was rescued on Saturday using a bow/arrow/fishing line apparatus\u2026. (More on that at some other time). \u00a0\u00a0<br /><br /><br />NU6XB-13 is equipped with two radios. A VHF radio (0.5-1Watts) with a range of about 150km that can send accurate GPS coordinates to ground stations using the APRS ham radio protocol. Tracking is possible when the balloon is over ground, but not over the ocean. The tracker is also equipped with a short wave radio (10 mili-Watts) transmitting at around 14MHz using a very special protocol called WSPR. WSPR was originally designed by Nobel laureate Joe Taylor (K1JT) to enable a system of beacons and receivers that can be used to study ionospheric propagation. It leverages frequency shift keying at a very low bit rate, transmitted over 2min and error correcting codes to enable detection of extremely weak transmissions. Using ionospheric propagation, these radio transmissions that are as weak as 1-10milliWatts can be decoded by stations 1000 miles away. Therefore it is possible to track the balloon also when it is over the ocean. Unfortunately, the WSPR protocol is very restricted, and the accuracy of the positioning information that can be sent is limited to about 100Km squared.<br /><br /><br />During day 1, NU6XB-13 travelled south all the way down off the coast of Baja California. It was received by short wave WSPR stations as far as Hawaii and New York!. \u00a0Then, it did a U turn and headed back north. This morning, the balloon woke up near San Diego with both the APRS (accurate) and WSPR (less accurate) beacons being received by ground stations. Today, it travelled across California, Arizona/Nevada and reached Utah at the end of the day just about 50miles short of reaching Zion National Park. <br /><br />Now, you may wonder what happened to NU6XB-11 \u2014 the one that was launched and not heard from\u2026. well\u2026 Yesterday at noon, we received a packet from NU6XB-11 indicating that it is in Tilden Park. Turns out that it did go up, but the winds made it crash into the eucalyptuses (again!) on the Seaview trail. There was enough sun at noon to turn it on get a GPS lock, and trait for 5min.\u2026.. A reconnaissance team went to rescue the tracker this morning \u2014 The balloon was found to be about 100\u2019 up on the top of the tree. \u00a0The tracker was not recovered ;-(.<br /><br />You can track both balloons at: <a href=\"https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FNU6XB-11%2Ca%2FNU6XB-13%2Ca%2FNU6XB-14&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800\">https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FNU6XB-11%2Ca%2FNU6XB-13%2Ca%2FNU6XB-14&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800</a><br /><br />You will see \u00a0NU6XB-11 stuck in Tilden park. <br />Nu6XB-13 is the accurate APRS tracker, and NU6XB-14 is the non-accurate WSPR tracker. <br /><br />Within the next 12 hours, the balloon is predicted to pass Chicago and leave the US mainland toward the Atlantic Ocean within 8 hours after that probably off Atlantic City, NJ. <br /><br />Both balloons carry a \u201cSpreading the GO BEARS love!\u201d Message and URL link : <a href=\"http://calham.ml/\">http://calham.ml/</a> \u00a0\u00a0and a phone number: &#43;1 (248) 434 5508 to get more information and leave messages. <br /><br />Hope you have a great final\u2019s week. <br /><br />More updates tomorrow. <br /><br />\u2014 Miki</p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Ff1787ee969cc1f7378e75fd66291b49ba43b46ccec1c23723ff28162ccb9a2a7%2FPastedGraphic-3.tiff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F6800e155aa19c3f0ff79116a4195040108418b7f44392885d144f63b1b2727a6%2FPastedGraphic-2.tiff\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fcff576f2b50a531ac2b02b6a020f335c2e410f96a18692d6ba5225c295cec3e2%2Fballoon.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" alt=\"\" /></p>", "created": "2021-12-13T01:56:10Z", "subject": "EECS Balloons day 2 (kind of) update-- an epic story of two party balloons", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kx40yfyqp325o4", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16207, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539169666, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 493}
