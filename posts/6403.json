It&#39;s definitely doable to take those three in a single semester, even as a sophomore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Why are you taking Data 100? I have a lot of friends taking it who say that it&#39;s not particularly useful in preparing for 189 or in getting a data science/ML internship.</p>\n<p>3. What do you mean by &#34;go down a machine learning path&#34;? Do you want to do ML in industry, or are you aiming to do ML research? Either way, I feel like you should aim to take 189 by 2nd semester junior year by the latest, and 1st semester ideally. This is so you have time to work on projects and in labs/clubs to build up your resume, since neither grad schools nor employers are going to take just 189 as sufficient.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. I took 189 last semester and am currently taking 126 and 127 concurrently. Looking back, I think that 126 before 189 is useful, but you can get more out of 127 after taking 189. Understanding the 127 material implies that you&#39;ll have an easier time with 189, but my personal opinion is that 127 is not a class that&#39;s well-organized enough to teach you those concepts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5. 126 in spring and 189 in fall sounds optimal for you. Of course, everything is specific to the individual. Depending on what you&#39;re comfortable with, you could try a few combinations of varying difficulty. 126 concurrently with 189 in the spring (probably without 170), or 189 in the spring and then 126/127 in the fall\u00a0may be viable options.</p>\n<p>6. Also, don&#39;t feel like you can&#39;t start ML until you&#39;ve taken 189. I know plenty of people who joined organizations like Machine Learning &#64; Berkeley, started working on their own side projects, did Kaggle competitions, or got involved in research before taking 189.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-03-29T07:13:24Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jfc6n4zu3lr6x", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"j6b1o0sq8uz77d": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iduqoh9fk9oju", "name": "Yuzheng Jia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iduqoh9fk9oju"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/25 - 3/31", "bucket_order": 106, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/25 - 3/31", "bucket_order": 106, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-29T23:33:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jfd5nposxlr6xg", "subject": "<p>Above anon responding:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. The Data 100 syllabus says that it teaches &#34;languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.&#34; In simpler words, it teaches SQL, how to use scikit-learn and matplotlib, high school stats concepts, and some things that will be explored in much greater detail in 189. I don&#39;t think that this class covers anything that isn&#39;t in 126 or anything that will prepare you for 189. You can take it if you want, but most people I talk to say that it&#39;s only really good for getting easy units.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. It&#39;s hard to answer more specifically without knowing what you want to do with ML. If you take 189 1st semester senior year, then you won&#39;t be able to do ML/data science internships in the summer after your junior year. It&#39;ll be hard to do side projects and explore ML on your own. You won&#39;t be able to start research/get publications until after PhD/master&#39;s applications close. I highly doubt employers will look at just 189 (without side projects, clubs, or past internships to back up your ML experience) and decide to hire you over others. Also, 189 is &#34;technically a graduate level course,&#34; but that shouldn&#39;t scare you from taking it earlier. I took it in the fall as a sophomore with just 53/54/70/16AB as prep and got an A&#43;, so you shouldn&#39;t be in the mindset that you have to be super prepared.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-03-29T23:33:37Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/25 - 3/31", "bucket_order": 106, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-30T07:23:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jfdmg2s8vs11ag", "subject": "<p>Thanks for the response, it&#39;s impressive that you did that well with that level of background.\u00a0 I&#39;d definitely consider taking\u00a0the class earlier, but I don&#39;t want to be lost in the material.\u00a0 would you say you did well because you had previous\u00a0experience with ML before taking 189 / you were already comfortable with higher level applied linear algebra, probability, and optimization / you are generally a quick learner /\u00a0189 is generally a high workload class\u00a0but with generous grading curve?\u00a0 or some combination of these factors?\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2018-03-30T07:23:34Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/25 - 3/31", "bucket_order": 106, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-30T07:53:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jfdnhzg4f435of", "subject": "<p>189 (at least with Sahai) is a high-workload class with a generous grading curve.

Understand the reason behind every ML technique, and every step in derivations/proofs on homeworks. A lot of people just do the homeworks in groups, where they get easy access to the answers. You might nod and say &#34;uh huh,&#34; but it&#39;s really important to be able to navigate the problems on your own.\u00a0Carefully read through self grades, even for problems that you got right, and make sure that you understand the step-by-step approach. You might be able to pick up new techniques or insights, which is entirely the reason why we have to do self grades. Good questions to always be asking yourself are &#34;Does this make sense&#34; and &#34;Why are we doing it like this.&#34;</p>\n<p>2. Never give up on trying to understand something. You are adequately prepared if you&#39;ve taken the lower divs. If something comes up in class that you&#39;re lacking in, take the time to look up notes online. I distinctly remember finding\u00a0resources from MIT/Stanford on quadratic forms, multivariate Gaussians, different ways of interpreting matrix products, and a few other topics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Be really precise and neat. It becomes easier to do problems when it&#39;s clear that you&#39;re working with a matrix $$X$$ and a random vector $$w \\sim N(\\mu, I)$$, and you can pull upon your knowledge from 16AB/70 much faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0Become familiar with the material to the point that you can teach others, write good notes, or call out Sahai/your discussion TA when they make mistakes.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-03-30T07:53:03Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-29T18:54:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jfcvoxkq9812a6", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Questions for responder:</p>\n<p>1.
