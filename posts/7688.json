Probably no amount of petitioning will change the fact that there likely isn&#39;t anyone else available or willing to teach it (this is exacerbated by the fact that a bunch of IC professors are taking off this Spring for a variety of reasons). As for 240B, it&#39;s usually a Spring class as well (the 240 series is structured as the analog IC series for incoming grad students, so 240A/140 is intended for Fall, 240B for Spring, and 240C for Fall, when 240C is offered). If you&#39;re a sophomore, I wouldn&#39;t panic just yet-- there are plenty of interesting and relevant classes that you can take next semester, including 120 (or 123 if you&#39;re taking 120 now), 130, 143, 151 (caution on this one, it&#39;s by far the most useful of these for someone specializing in ICs but also might be *the* most time-consuming EECS class, besides maybe 164 with Hilfinger), and 152. Obviously, this is assuming you&#39;ve finished the lower-div requirements (including Physics 7B, which is definitely a pre-req for 130 and 143, and CS 70, which is actually kind of important background knowledge for a lot of cool things in EE). If you&#39;re a junior, the above recommendations hold, although you might be forced to give up taking one of 140 or 142 down the road (140 is definitely way more important, in my opinion, and 142 is dominated by grad students anyway), but you can definitely still get a lot out of Berkeley&#39;s program (this is also making the assumption that 140 is offered next Fall, but I would bet on this because the only thing this department cares about more than increasing access to CS to infinity is research/grad students :^)).</p>", "created": "2018-10-02T20:42:28Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>It seems that the schedule for the EE classes in Spring 2019 is incomplete, mostly because EE 126/127\u00a0aren&#39;t even there yet either.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-10-02T00:41:07Z", "subject": "", "uid": "iptcfdj3fri51o"}], "id": "jmqzyygspy75r", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jl3fm3v4u3z65g": 1539359870}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j47ryojpjcn53r", "name": "James Dalton", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewimhnbg2se", "name": "Adilet Pazylkarim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j47ryojpjcn53r", "j6lewimhnbg2se", "is6p6uis14y5ot"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/30 - 10/6", "bucket_order": 77, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 9/30 - 10/6", "bucket_order": 77, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-02T21:52:57Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jms9ejli20n3jq", "subject": "<p>Ah shucks, that&#39;s a shame to hear then.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "iptcfdj3fri51o", "updated": "2018-10-02T21:52:57Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-02T02:07:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jmr325h48267lp", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "OP: I hoped that was the case, but it looks like 126/127 are under EECS 126/127, so they wouldn&#39;t appear under EE anymore.\n\nhttps://classes.berkeley.edu/search/class/?f%5B0%5D=im_field_term_name%3A831&amp;f%5B1%5D=im_field_subject_area%3A203", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-10-02T02:07:35Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-01T22:09:45Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "I see that they released the schedule for next semester, is this the final schedule?
