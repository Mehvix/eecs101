I highly highly recommend you take 16B before taking 120 as 120 takes off pretty fast and you have to be really comfortable switching between discrete and real time systems.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You will also struggle a lot in 16B without having taken 16A in the 1st module of circuits (assuming you have no prior experience with circuits). Your physics knowledge of circuits is not that great 16B unfortunately. You could take Math 54 before coming into 16B but make you sure understand the circuits module really well and be able to do problems because 16B assumes you have this knowledge 100% and goes full steam. While later modules don&#39;t have circuits perse, concepts inevitably ties back to circuits. I think the other point people don&#39;t talk about when doing 54-&gt;16B is the labs. If you have 0 breadboarding or EE lab experience, the 16B labs will take you 8-10 hours instead of the usual 2-3 because you will have no idea what you&#39;re doing. Thats one of the benefits of taking 16A is having that lab exposure at a slower pace, but I understand if you&#39;re running low on time due to major requirements and what not. You will simply struggle tremendously in the first 2-3 labs before it slowly gets better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have questions lmk and I&#39;ll be willing to answre</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdx6ko9ssli6ns", "name": "Mihran Miroyan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kdx6ko9ssli6ns"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2020-11-06T17:34:55Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-07T08:12:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kh7etlmug1q153", "subject": "<p>thanks! so, if I take EECS 16A in Spring 2021, then will it be okay to take MATH 53, EECS 16B and MEC ENG C85 in Fall 2021?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "kdx6ko9ssli6ns", "updated": "2020-11-07T08:12:20Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-07T08:51:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kh7g8exsze52he", "subject": "<p>@Francis\u00a0 or EECS 16B and MATH 53 in Fall 2021 and MEC ENG C85 in Spring 2022?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "kdx6ko9ssli6ns", "updated": "2020-11-07T08:51:51Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-07T06:16:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kh7ao8r4s6obn", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "@Mihran, I\u2019m taking ME C85 this semester.
