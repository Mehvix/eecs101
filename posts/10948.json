The year before, I lost track but the number might have easily been twice that.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, you need to evaluate which step of the process you&#39;re failing more often than you should be. Is your callback rate after applying really low (say &lt;10%)? If so, then your resume might be a problem, and you&#39;ll need to work on improving it. Or are you getting enough callbacks, but are unable to pass \u00a0interviews? If so, then you&#39;re going to have to do an autopsy of what went wrong in the interview, if anything, and other potential red flags that you think were raised that caused the interviewer to reject you. You mention that you have only got 3 callbacks from 89 applications this year, and 5 from 150 last year. This is good for a ~3.33% callback rate, and that is a number that you can definitely bring up by working on your resume, via personal projects and/or research experience if you have the GPA to obtain it. As a sophomore I only really had some research experience via URAP and my personal projects were literally just lower div projects and it took me, like I said, probably 400&#43; applications to land an offer. My callback rate back then was about 5%, and with the added experience, my callback rate was bumped up to 11-12% this year.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, keep grinding LC even if you&#39;re unable to get many interviews as you work on your resume, as it can really help you stay sharp for any interviews that may appear out of nowhere.
