A few weeks back when I added 127 to my schedule, there was a W 10-11am discussion that worked perfectly and I added it to my schedule. It sat in my shopping cart all this time no problems. Today when I go to my shopping cart to enroll, I notice that that class was still in my shopping cart, but when I went through the actual enrollingn process but it didn&#39;t show up in the schedule maker anymore. Initially I thought that discussion was cancelled but I went to classes.berkeley.edu to check\u00a0all possible discussions and there were the original 6 there but only 4 of them are showing up on calcentral for enrollment? Any help with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>", "created": "2019-10-31T22:58:03Z", "subject": "EECS 127 missing discussions on schedule planner", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k2fb7whcqtp1dw", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10695, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545366831, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 220}
