However, there are a couple of things you need to consider before you pull the trigger on a monitor:</p>\n<p>- What budget do you want to allocate for the monitor?</p>\n<p>- How big is the monitor/what is the aspect ratio?\u00a0</p>\n<p>- What resolution is the resolution? A larger monitor with lower resolution will look too blurry but a small monitor that&#39;s 4k will probably not be very great either.</p>\n<p>- What panel technology does it use? IPS, TN, VA?</p>\n<p>- What&#39;s the refresh rate, color accuracy, latency?\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Ports? Some very high end monitors have a thunderbolt 3 port. Do you require that?\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The stand the monitor comes in the box with is also something to consider if you don&#39;t plan on buying a third party stand/arm. Do you need to have a wide range of adjustments, tilt, pivot?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is definitely a lot to take in. Unless you have a very specific use case, I think asking on Facebook or friends/family if they have a spare monitor will suffice.
