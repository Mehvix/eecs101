The webpage says the following:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Enrollment Time Conflict Process<br />Beginning with fall semester 2016, you will no longer be able to automatically enroll in two classes that meet at the same time. If you try to enroll in two classes that have a time schedule overlap, CalCentral will alert you at the point of\u00a0enrollment and give you an opportunity to submit an online request to enroll in both classes.\u00a0It will take approximately one business day to process request forms. If no other restrictions prevent you from enrolling in both classes,\u00a0your time conflict restriction will be waived and your enrollment will be processed.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Waitlist Time Conflict Process<br />If you try to\u00a0waitlist\u00a0for a\u00a0fall semester 2016\u00a0class that has a\u00a0time\u00a0schedule overlap with another class for which you have enrolled or waitlisted, CalCentral will alert you at the point of processing and give you an opportunity to submit an online request. If a waitlist\u00a0seat is available and you have no other restrictions, the\u00a0waitlist\u00a0request will be processed. It will take approximately one business day to process request forms.</p>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>People seem to think it will be impossible to enroll in classes with a time conflict, when it fact it seems as though you can submit an online request at the time of registration to take both classes at the same time (although it takes a day to process). Perhaps I&#39;m just the one who&#39;s been misunderstanding what has been said, but I figured I&#39;d make a note here in case anyone else misunderstood as well.
