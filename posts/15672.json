This is a time when AI is drawing a lot of interest as a field, and as a consequence 188 is more popular than ever. But because of all of the \u201chype\u201d around AI, we worry some of you might have the wrong impressions about what the course will teach you. A lot of the interest in AI right now is because of advances in deep (supervised) learning. Skills in deep learning are increasingly sought-after in industry. But 188 does not focus on deep learning -- you\u2019ll learn some basics in the last part of the course, but it\u2019s really not the main focus of 188. For an advantage in the job market, we\u2019d recommend 189 and 182 instead. 188 is really a class for AI \u201centhusiasts\u201d. We\u2019ll spend most of our time on sequential decision making problems and on probabilistic inference, and relatively little on supervised learning. Sequential decision making is precisely the stuff that doesn\u2019t work that well yet, so companies are far less interested.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short, please take 188 if you\u2019re deeply curious about AI outside of supervised learning -- the type of AI that, say, a robot might use to decide what actions to take -- and we promise it will be great fun :)\u00a0 If you want to learn about the stuff that everyone talks about these days and companies are looking for, 182 and 189 would be much better fits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">------------------</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would add that even if the content you learn in the class isn&#39;t too useful in industry yet, the problem solving/creative thinking skills that the class helps you learn will help you in any career! Also the class is a lot of fun :)\u00a0</p>", "created": "2021-09-09T06:54:57Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvfdkoi9n4bq"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ktcksr8kps176", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzlnpfrl2qk2e6"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11593": 3, "13208": 6, "13345": 5, "14781": 0, "14908": 1, "2347": 8, "4717": 4, "7792": 9, "8154": 7, "8280": 2}}, "created": "2021-09-08T02:06:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m a junior in cs and im in cs188 right now.
