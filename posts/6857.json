There is usually some programming-related assignment on every single problem set. And with the right background, students should get a lot out of every part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This combination is chosen because that&#39;s the best way to actually understand something in a way that you can build upon it. Is 189 a complete ML-oriented degree by itself? The answer is no. of course not. Ideally, we would have a lot more HW problems with more parts each. But there are only 24 hours in a day and 189 is just one course. Does the ML trilogy of 126, 127, and 189 give students what they need to be able to self-study effectively and engage with ML material, both to deepen their understanding as well as engage practically? Yes. Probably another semester or two worth of self-study (including projects pursued on your own) beyond that core upper-division ML trilogy would make students extremely competitive at the bachelor&#39;s level for essentially any project that requires ML training.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, are there other ML-oriented courses that adjust the balance of coverage to be on things that are more immediately useful in practice? Yes! IEOR offers some for example, within the college of engineering itself.
