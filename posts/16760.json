On the CoE website, there is a requirement that:</p>\n<ul><li>Your program must include a minimum of<strong>\u00a0five upper division courses that are distinct to your engineering major\u00a0</strong>(5 classes beyond any that overlap)</li></ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>I understand I can only double-count 2 upper-divs between EECS and DS. But this clause in particular confuses me. If this is the case, would I then have to take 7 upper divison EECS courses (rather than the 5 required to meet 20 upper div units) if I double-counted two of them? What is the point of being able to double-count if that is the case?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks for any clarification you can provide.
