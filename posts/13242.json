It&#39;s a lot easier to go from a FAANG company to a smaller place than the other way around because that &#34;stamp of approval&#34; gives you an implicit assumption of competence and can help you have more leverage down the road; guess it&#39;s not that different from the choice between going to Berkeley vs a smaller less well-known college.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>re: where you&#39;ll have the most impact, that depends on how you define it. TBH intern impact is pretty limited to begin with regardless of company because you&#39;re learning and are only there for a short amount of time... but do you define impact as reaching a lot of users and having heavy reach outside of your company? FAANG&#43; is 100% the way to go, where even the smallest button built by an intern reaches millions of people. (I shipped code on my third day of work that immediately went live on 40M user accounts; can&#39;t think of any non FAANG/unicorn companies where that would have been the case). If you&#39;re defining impact by how much of the team is affected by your work output, the smaller companies win here but again, remember that you&#39;re there for 12-16 weeks max and for most full-timers, that&#39;s still considered noob ramp up time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Things like team placement process matter a lot for full-time placement, but don&#39;t get too hung up on it for an internship. Even in the worst case scenario (no control, crap team placement), chances are the FAANG company has enough resources that you&#39;ll learn a lot and get a strong experience regardless. Big companies are very much input in = output out; you can take advantage of intern mentorship programs and team networking and shadowing opportunities and all the other random intern-only activities. Whereas at a smaller company the limited resource pool actually gives you less control over your overall experience (counterintuitive, I know).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, all of this is relative. If you&#39;re defining small company purely based on size and this is like, Airbnb vs Google they won&#39;t be that different from an intern perspective. This is more applicable to companies at different stages (ie. startup smaller than Series D vs FAANG/unicorn)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd05knejlh0", "name": "Ruby Werman", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd05knejlh0"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-10-08T20:22:54Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11423": 4, "12964": 1, "474": 6, "6975": 5, "7052": 0, "7868": 7, "7998": 2, "8164": 3, "937": 8, "9987": 9}}, "created": "2020-10-07T17:31:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m deciding between two internships for next summer and not really sure which to take.
