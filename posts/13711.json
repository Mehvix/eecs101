In addition, I&#39;m sure the vast majority of people who end up doing a PhD in ML don&#39;t come in with that as their goal - the (EE)CS major is much broader and covers a lot more ground (UX design, Embedded systems, etc) so for someone who likes this material but doesn&#39;t have much experience, the average freshman college student, (EE)CS is a much better bet.
