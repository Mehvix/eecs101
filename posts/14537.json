You can get a feel for lecture/hw content by looking at the (free) textbook [here](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/books/leeseshia/releases/LeeSeshia_DigitalV2_2.pdf), as lecture content and hw problems are straight from the textbook. You can get a feel for the lab content by taking a look at the lab textbook [here](http://bit.ly/3hnYwv3). Lab assignments mainly involved C programming reading micro controller documentation to get I/O to work on your robot and then also getting your robot to do basic tasks.
