Did you enjoy the analysis of stable matching in 70? Did you like the DFT in 16B? If so, go for 170.... Did you like the probability parts of 70? Want to eventually understand ML and/or AI? Go for 126.... Did you really like all the obviously machine-learning parts of 16A and 16B? Go for 127. Did you like the analog circuits parts of 16A and 16B? Go for 105. Did you like the digital parts of 61C and 16B? Go for 151. Did you like 61C and C? Go for 162. Did you like the spirit of your Physics and Chemistry classes, and the connections between the physical and electronic worlds teased in 16A and 16B? Go for 130. Did you really like the concept of frequency domain and the control and DFT sections in 16B?
