A lot of it was because I managed my time terribly and kept ignoring everything other than 61c and my mental health also really took a dip over the semester so I might not be able to give you an accurate impression; I imagine it would be definitely doable but still somewhat tight with all the stuff you have mentioned. I agree that it shouldn&#39;t be bad if you PNP everything (or at least 2 of those), but for 61c you&#39;ll still have to put in a decent amount of work since the projects are where a lot of the points are. My only word of advice off the top of my head: I&#39;d try to be on the same page with your partner(s) about PNP for 61c and anything else group-project-wise so you don&#39;t later have disagreements about time commitments and such.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdz51vmb3hzbu", "name": "Manas Trivedi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "kdz51vmb3hzbu", "jjzd0ebjf50lh"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-01-18T05:12:28Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10399": 6, "10672": 0, "10888": 2, "11768": 7, "13222": 4, "13233": 3, "4078": 8, "7135": 9, "8177": 1, "9963": 5}}, "created": "2021-01-18T03:12:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is taking ee16b (hands on lab), data 100, and cs61c a manageable workload?
