Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal.

Why did this happen?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> This is most likely due to an enrolled student switching from an open lab/discussion to a lab/discussion that is full. Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal. If you see yourself, however, suddenly shift down many seats at once, this could be a bug. Please email ee-scheduling&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu if you suddenly see yourself shift 10&#43; seats at once.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>#pin</p>", "created": "2018-10-15T21:56:39Z", "subject": "EE/EECS, Sp 19 Enrollment Information", "uid": "jn4sudgnuyx784"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p></p><h1>Spring 2019 EE and EECS enrollment information:</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enrollment Priorities for <a href=\"https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-spring-eleng-16a-001-lec-001\">EE16A</a> and <a href=\"https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-spring-eleng-16b-001-lec-001\">EE16B</a> can be found on classes.berkeley.edu.

If your lab fills while you\u2019re waitlisted, the only way to switch it is to drop and re-add the class. This will put you at the bottom of the WL, but you cannot be enrolled into a full section. WL\u2019d students with full labs will be skipped over when the WL processes automatically. Check classes.berkeley.edu for open labs before dropping and re-adding.</p>\n</li></ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EE and EECS <a href=\"https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/eecs/degree-reqs/enrollment-policy#upper\">upper-division classes</a></strong><strong>:</strong> These classes still do not have enrollment priorities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EE 16B: </strong>See classes.berkeley.edu for the labs schedule. Labs are 50 seats per section and are split into two enrollments. For example, Lab 115/115A occur at the same time, day, and location. You may enroll in either.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>999 DIS Sections</strong><strong>:</strong> Similarly to the CS side, EE16A and EE16B will have 999 discussion sections to facilitate enrollment. For EE16A and EE16B, you may be enrolled in one discussion section, but attend a different one. When adding this class you should choose the lecture, a lab section, and DIS 999. The schedules of DIS sections are visible on classes.berkeley.edu. You may attend any DIS section as long as there is a seat in the classroom. If the class is full, you will need to attend a different section. You must attend the lab section in which you are enrolled.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Switching Secondary Sections while Waitlisted</strong><strong>:</strong> Dissimilar to the CS side, if you need to switch to another lab and/or dis section while waitlisted for an EE/EECS class, you still need to drop the class completely and re-add in order to switch. </p>\n<ul><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are enrolled in a class, you should use the \u201cEdit\u201d feature in CalCentral to switch.
