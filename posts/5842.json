As Mudit is pointing out, one option for the staff would be to simply transition everything over to Piazza. Why is email &#34;official&#34; and piazza &#34;unofficial&#34;? Simply because the advising staff deem one official, and the other unofficial, or because the students perceive one as official, and vice versa. I do not mean that this distinction is trivial, rather, it is a design decision and should be optimized accordingly. I am comfortable saying that Piazza was &#34;official&#34; inasmuch as students perceived it so - certainly if Nicole posts something on\u00a0EECS 101 in the instructor box, I think we would all consider it official. Indeed, &#64;5046&#39;s transition to making EECS 101 unofficial implicitly recognizes that it was serving an official function before.

Consider the\u00a0growth in LSCS majors. There are currently 1,203, and the growth is very fast, if not exponential.\u00a0Suppose that 1/3 of CS-intended declare. Based on the most common EECs 101 posts, it is reasonable to believe that those who have not declared ask at least as many questions as those who have declared. So the total population of students asking questions is $$EECS &#43; CS_{declared}~~~~&#43; CS_{undeclared}~~~~$$, or 1343 &#43; 1203 &#43; (2 * 1203) = 4350.5, let&#39;s round to 4350 for that even number. Suppose each person only consumes 20 minutes of advising time per semester. That&#39;s over 1305 hours of advising per semester. Even if these figures are rough, I think the order of magnitude is defensible. What happens when the number of LSCS kids doubles? Will the number of advisers scale pro rata? I do not think the budget will allow for that.

Maybe at least a list of &#34;staff approved&#34; peer advisors or something somewhere? Forgive me if this already exists and I just haven&#39;t been able to find it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a more general point though, Berkeley is a large and confusing school and\u00a0students are generally left to sink or swim. There is already enough confusion about official (and unofficial) department policies--for example, (1) the number of friends I have who&#39;ve said &#34;If I knew Math 54 was going to be lifted as a requirement, ...&#34; and (2) the historical conflicting messages from faculty and departmental staff regarding when/how to take the 16 series (not sure if this is so much of a problem anymore, but I remember this being a pretty big thing a couple years back).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In order to avoid similar confusion, we need to have a clear mindset of which mediums are for official policy, and which are for unofficial advice. I see the EECS Facebook page, Piazza 101, email, and talking to departmental staff directly as the four main methods of getting EECS-related advice at this school, in order of increasing officialness (if that&#39;s a word). However, when the department inconsistently becomes involved in the former two (FB and Piazza), it starts blurring the lines. Students need to know where to go for advice they can trust, and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true at the present moment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, it is strange to me that departmental announcements and information about enrollment will be continue to be posted on Piazza, but we won&#39;t get official responses about anything else. It is also strange that in the face of a growing student population, the response is to opt to have official avenues of advice veer towards email or in-person solutions, rather than embracing the efficiency of using an online platform.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is not intended to be directed specifically at the EECS department, EECS students, or other responders to this post. In fact, I find a lot of the discussion on this thread mildly toxic (and hope I am not contributing to this toxicity). I understand that the EECS department (and the university as a whole) is already stretched thin in terms of resources, and I understand that logistically it may be hard to monitor multiple websites AND respond to emails AND do everything else that\u00a0the staff does, which is why I think the peer advisor solution is actually quite a clever one. However, I think that the decision to move away from official advice on Piazza and move towards more individualized advising through email or in-person counseling is the wrong direction for the department, and this decision may end up causing more inefficiency and confusion.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2017-12-28T20:29:05Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/24 - 12/30", "bucket_order": 119, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/24 - 12/30", "bucket_order": 119, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-29T18:44:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jbs9opq0wih71a", "subject": "Yeah, I agree that certain types of questions aren\u2019t directed to advisors.
