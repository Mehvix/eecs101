(The [HKN course map](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/assets/course-map-2019-da79ecbe2fc25e6b6349b8931364890032b8d51aacaccea65151ae98316f0587.png) kind of makes it look like a prereq -- make of that what you will.) EECS 126 teaches a lot of the same content as what is taught in the second half of CS 70, but since most students in EECS 126 have taken CS 70 already and are seeing the material the second time around, expectations in EECS 126 are higher.\n\nThe workload in EECS 126 is similar to the workload in CS 70. EECS 126 is in my opinion tougher than most CS lower-divs except possibly EECS 16B and CS 70, but it is very manageable if you have the right knowledge going in.
