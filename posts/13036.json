That being said, Anonymous is correct in that we are starting formal classes *NEXT* week and there is no class at 2pm today. This course historically started in week 3 then moved to starting at the beginning of the term--though in this case starting next week means students will be on the same assignments each week and can pick project partners via bcourses from the other lecture which greatly increases your options.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please feel free to email me letting me know if you recently applied for the course or if you have been registered and just didn&#39;t catch my correspondence (just put &#34;CS370 question&#34; in the subject line so my filter catches it).
