One example that I thought was amazing was the connection between the double dual space and the Lagrangian (<a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/223235/please-explain-the-intuition-behind-the-dual-problem-in-optimization\">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/223235/please-explain-the-intuition-behind-the-dual-problem-in-optimization</a>). But in terms of doing well in the exams, I think a majority of it reduces to being able to reproduce the results found in the slides/textbook/livebook, and so practicing those allowed me to take the exams relatively well. Knowing all the tricks that they use algebraically is important. Of course that approach is less fun, though.</p>", "created": "2018-12-25T03:48:52Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p9yhgkea17e"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I don&#39;t know if I qualify answering your answer, just want to share some experience.
