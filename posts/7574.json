It is not about skills. Transfers are great and strong Berkeley students. The problem is only the extremely short runway that the system gives them. 5 semesters is an incredibly short period of time. And so, being able to schedule ambitiously to hit an intro grad level course before graduating is way harder than it is for someone who has an 8 semester runway. There&#39;s just not as much room to maneuver. This is a reality that many forget. Effectively, every transfer is asked to graduate in 2.5 years. It&#39;s not impossible, but the fact that so many transfer students pull this off doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that they are a very ambitious and hardworking group. (Ambition isn&#39;t graded on a curve.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is great that more folks are interested in machine learning. This is literally why the entire curriculum has been reworked with the introduction of 16AB to better support this, and to make it clear that these ideas are considered fundamental to *everyone* in the major. Given that *every* major has significant exposure to linear regression, polynomial features, matching pursuit and sparse recovery, the SVD, k-means, PCA, and classification by hyperplanes before they even leave the lower division; it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t know anything about machine learning. By the time they have also taken 126 and 127, they *already* know more machine learning than most students anywhere else in a traditional EE or traditional CS program who have taken an ML course. Getting 189-level depth and perspective on top of this puts students in a *far* better position than most. (In fact, it largely obviates the need for many students to pursue a traditional course-only MS elsewhere.)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2018-08-31T15:58:16Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/2 - 9/8", "bucket_order": 128, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-09-04T18:50:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jlo2kc40smy1u2", "subject": "<p>&#43;1 for Mudit&#39;s comment.
