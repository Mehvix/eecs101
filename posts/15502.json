For this kind of role, 126/127/189 are typically good choices. In addition, Stat 215A is also quite a good class for this stuff as a more applied stats/ML class. 227B/227C are also good classes but they are often quite difficult to get in as an undergrad.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to focus more on the low latency stuff, ignore the course recommendations above and take the low-level and systems classes, i.e. 151/152/162/164.
