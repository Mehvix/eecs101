As you may have heard, our faculty are developing two new courses, EE\u00a016A\u00a0and B, which will eventually replace EE 20 and 40. These courses are designed to be more hands-on than their predecessors, and will allow students to be introduced to EE concepts earlier in their academic careers. These courses will not formally require physics or math as a prerequisite, although they do require some math maturity and aptitude (equivalent to math 1a and math 1b) in order to be successful. Here are some frequently asked questions to help you understand this transition.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>When do the new courses begin?\u00a0</b></div>\n<div>EE\u00a016A\u00a0is expected to be offered for the first time in Spring 2015, and EE 16B will be offered beginning Fall 2015. In Spring of 2015, EE\u00a016A\u00a0will be introduced as a pilot program and is expected to offer seats for approximately 50 students.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>When will the old courses expire?</b></div>\n<div>The last term in which EE 20 and 40 will be offered is Fall of 2015. It is unlikely that these courses will be available after Fall 2015.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>Which sequence is the right one for me?</b></div>\n<div>If you have already taken EE 20 or 40, you should plan on finishing the sequence before they expire. You must complete both courses in a sequence (EE 20 AND 40/ EE\u00a016A\u00a0AND B). Substitutions are not allowed. Continuing students and transfer students who have taken either EE 20 or 40 are encouraged to finish out the sequence before these courses disappear in Fall of 2015. Incoming Freshmen should plan to wait until Spring 2015 (or later) to take EE\u00a016A.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>Will the new courses be the same size as the old courses?</b></div>\n<div>In Spring 2015 we will offer a limited-enrollment pilot program of EE\u00a016A, which we expect will seat approximately 50 students. Eventually, we expect EE\u00a016A\u00a0and B to scale to the size of EE 20 and 40.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br />If you have additional questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact Sarah Van Nostrand in the EECS department at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:svannostrand&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\">svannostrand&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu</a>.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>*** Please note: these updates are intended for declared EECS majors.
