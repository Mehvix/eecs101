Don&#39;t do 4 technicals. In this I don&#39;t mean that it will be impossible to keep up with the material or that ur grades will suffer (they might or they might not), what I mean is that CS170, Data100, 61C are all courses that actually help you for industry/SWE/new fields of CS, and as a result you wanna absorb as much as you can out of those classes. Whether that be doing a personal project in that course or actually reading about related material in your free time. If you take all 4 classes at the same time, what will end up happening is that rather than enjoying the material and actually\u00a0absorbing the material, you&#39;ll just be focused on getting the work over with and that lectures will just be &#34;something &#34; you HAVE to get finish so you can go on to the next one. Couple that ECs and social life, and you will end up not spending as much time on each topic as you can/should be. Instead of spending time on the homework and grinding through it, you&#39;ll spend ur time most likely trying to get it finished. All in all, unless ur FULLY committed to those 4 classes/academics, then don&#39;t take it.
