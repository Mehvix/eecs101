I found 188 fairly difficult because I just didn&#39;t really understand the concepts, and the exams really test if you understand all of the course material and can solve problems. That being said, I think the exams weren&#39;t harder than any other course I&#39;ve taken, and what I just said goes for any class. Then again I think that all of the CS classes I&#39;ve taken have had hard exams... [61ABC, 70 170 161 188] actually I think 161 exams weren&#39;t that bad. Anyways yeah I don&#39;t think you should really worry about this question. Just study, understand the material, and the exams will be as they are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tldr: they&#39;re not really harder than other classes in my opinion. Just people don&#39;t study as much during the semester and blow the class off, so everyone thinks the exams are hard.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-03-16T06:54:22Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/10 - 3/16", "bucket_order": 55, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-16T19:20:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jtbvmi169ll29q", "subject": "<p>[I&#39;m the OP] Thanks, that was\u00a0sort of what I figured but just wanted to make sure.
