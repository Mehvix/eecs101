But although that bug has been fixed in the requirements, students who are in the position of having those be the requirements when they declared will be allowed to complete under those requirements. However, we encourage those students to actually take EE16B since that makes much more sense from an educational point of view. (i.e. It is important for someone who is planning to have a multi-decade career involving CS to know the basics of control theory, the SVD and PCA, and to understand the basics of the dynamic behavior of systems and circuits. The future is going to involve robotics and learning and information-processing by dynamic systems --- if not in the next decade, almost certainly by the decade after that. Foundations are important --- that is what an undergraduate education is really about because Industry won&#39;t build them.

The entire treatment of material, style of homeworks, etc. is designed to allow students who take it seriously to sincerely engage with conceptual and skill gaps that they have and to overcome them on this journey. This is simply not one of the design objectives for Math 54.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A takes it for granted that students live in a world that has computers in it and that software tools should be used to help students connect with the ideas. Practically every week, there is something that forces you to connect with ideas in the course using a computer. \u00a0This facilitates\u00a0students being able to leverage their computational intuition to help strengthen their mathematical intuition.\u00a0This is not something that Math 54 cares about at all and so is a major lost learning opportunity, especially for a student interested in CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A has labs in which you get to see the linear-algebraic concepts that you are learning actually pay off in an application. This allows students to connect physical intuition to further strengthen and reinforce their mathematical intuition. Math 54 has no labs and does not usually try to engage strongly with physical intuition or vice-versa, use mathematical intuition to build physical intuition.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A is part of a two semester sequence with EE16B --- so it knows that students will get more deeply familiar with ideas as they are developed and encountered over these two semesters. Consequently, EE16A can afford to reduce the seeming coverage of certain linear-algebraic material in exchange for actually deepening students core thinking skills. The circuits module in 16A is really about teaching design and problem modeling and decomposition skills, while also providing much deeper groundings for lots of core linear-algebraic and mathematical ways of thinking. \u00a0(While, yes, also teaching students about a complementary perspective on what information processing is and how it engages with the physical world.) Math 54 isn&#39;t able to spend time on building those mental muscles because it has other things that must be covered. \u00a0By the time students finish EE16B, the treatment of the material has gone beyond Math 54 in multiple dimensions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, you have to remember that certain key faculty members and several of the key TAs who shaped 16A had come directly from having taught 70 before. They had seen exactly the kinds of mental-muscle weaknesses that had caused students to shed tears in 70. (It&#39;s not the material in 70 that is ever the real cause of student difficulty --- it&#39;s almost always thinking.) And 16AB were explicitly designed to strengthen those muscles while also building broader conceptual foundations for machine learning, robotics, circuit design, vision, AI, etc. Math 54 wasn&#39;t designed with any of this in mind. It serves a wide variety of engineering and physical science departments and focuses on teaching a set of material.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Can students go from Math 54 and do well in 70? Sure they can. Lots of people have. Will students who went through 16AB not have to work in 70? Nope! 70 is going to be work because it takes work to learn new material and internalize it, along with leveling up certain ways of thinking as well. \u00a0But the recommended path of 16A, 16B, and then 70 is recommended for a reason.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2017-06-08T07:41:35Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-06-07T02:57:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j3melmuic9x21v", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>why is EE16A advised over math 54?
