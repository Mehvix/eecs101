out of 189, take both 126 and 127 before taking 189. Then, your understanding of 189 will be significantly deeper.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have taken the standard sequence: 16A, 16B, and 70, (with math 53 in there as well) the next course to take is 126. Full stop. Then, if you feel very comfortable with the linear algebra and have absorbed the basic optimization problem modeling ideas\u00a0from 16AB, you can in principle take 189. You&#39;d be better off having taken 127 (which by the way is filled with lots of machine learning applications) as well, but you will still get a lot out of 189 and not be lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If for whatever reason you have not taken 16AB, then definitely take 127 first. Then, you can take 189 if you feel that your probability intuition is strong. (Not sure how it would actually get strong without having had 126, but maybe you took some other set of courses that really strengthened your probability intuition.) If your probability intuition is weak, then there are going to be parts of 189 where you will basically get slammed and there will be aspects of the story that you won&#39;t be able to properly internalize. But, with 127 under your belt, you&#39;ll still be able to make it through.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Again, best case: take 126 and 127 first, then take 189. After that, if you&#39;ve taken 16AB, 126 probably is more important than 127 as a foundation, but 127 has way more machine learning in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you can only choose two of the three to take, the answer is unambiguously to take 126 and 127. With those solidly under your belt, you can essentially self-study 189 if you need to. The reverse is not possible. There&#39;s a way of thinking that 126 and 127 convey that is very hard to get without taking the course. Meanwhile, the way of thinking that 189 teaches that goes beyond 126/127 is largely obtainable by the world teaching you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To use a machine learning perspective, if your prior is initialized properly by 126 and 127, then stochastic gradient descent by doing real world problems and reading papers will make your inner understanding converge to what 189 is trying to teach you. But if you don&#39;t have 126 and 127, you will very likely get stuck in a bad local minimum. All 189 does is speed up the convergence. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2017-10-11T00:12:25Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/8 - 10/14", "bucket_order": 204, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-10-11T01:43:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j8mdgeseysv1eg", "subject": "<p>Thank you!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p95461bhej", "updated": "2017-10-11T01:43:53Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/8 - 7/14", "bucket_order": 165, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-11T16:59:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjhddzi9h6c4gj", "subject": "<p>Professor Sahai, thanks so much for your response!
