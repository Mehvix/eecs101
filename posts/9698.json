So it is definitely not required to have an internship to my knowledge although of course it can help. But if you have a bunch of personal projects that you have worked on and could talk about, I&#39;d argue that&#39;s more valuable than some random internship or an internship where you work on basically nothing. I believe you would still have a\u00a0great chance of getting a job, as long as you keep applying and trying. By the way, you might want to consider where you&#39;re dropping off in the application process, like are you not getting call backs? This could be a resume problem.
