Well, housing is housing, costs will be basically the same as they are now, but your housing would be mid June-Aug 10ish, so you&#39;ll be looking at subletting for 2 months, and might have to pay more for beginning of june and rest of august.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Child care, not sure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It seems there are a lot of variables and so it&#39;s in your best interest to talk to an academic counselor who may have more time to consider all your factors and give solid advice. My gut feeling is that if you&#39;re worried about all these factors, you should just not take summer class, take it during the school year in which you are already obligated to pay all these costs and find child care. Use your summer to build your skills and yourself, whether that&#39;s research, internship, side projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can talk to the professors but I imagine their answers will be similar to mine. Doesn&#39;t hurt to ask though. Summer class I took basically was my life for 8 weeks. I took 2 days off the entire 8 weeks, and even that was too much for me personally.
