Calculus is assumed, derivatives an d integral calculus.The rest is an application of these concepts into more complex robotic systems which I teach.\u00a0We also expect that students know a bit signal processing, such as Fourier Transform,Taylor approximation.&#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope that helps you make your decision. \u00a0In addition, I consulted with Professor Abbeel (more on the CS side of robotics) who said: &#34;I don&#39;t think the student has taken the wrong classes for more modern AI oriented robotics.&#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have more detailed questions along the lines of upper-division courses in Robotics I recommend you reach out Professor Bacjsy direclty. \u00a0You&#39;ll also be able to get good advice for next semester if you choose her or another Robotics professor for faculty advising. \u00a0Good luck!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Susanne</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hz09ebdonne102", "updated": "2015-08-06T00:17:43Z"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 8/2 - 8/8", "bucket_order": 242, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2015-08-06T01:27:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "iczixm5lq3t3np", "subject": "<p>Thanks a lot, Susanne!
