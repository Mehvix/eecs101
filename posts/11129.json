These types of skills are highly in demand as they can be applied to marketing and other forms of research that companies depend on nowadays. A lot of good engineering teams that exist right now have Data Scientists among them for those very roles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A computer science degree, however, is a lot more diverse, and the lack of strict requirements in the CS program at berkeley allows you to invest in whatever you want. Want to do traditional SWE, take the 16X courses. Interested more in theory and the mathematical side? Take 17X courses with some EE and Math mixed into it. Want to jump on the AI/ML wave? Take 188, 189, EE126 and EE127. And regardless of what you take, classes like 161 (Security) and 186 (Database Management) will always be useful. The value in that flexibility means that a CS degree gives you a diverse array of avenues to explore so that you can make the most out of our collegiate experience. It could also be the case that the unique combination of classes you want leans towards a Data Science degree more than a CS one, which is also an available route to take.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: I might be biased since I am a CS major.</p>", "created": "2020-01-07T21:47:23Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_3"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>if you can just declare both you dont have to finish both</p>", "created": "2020-01-07T20:57:48Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "k54cv6grghh7l1", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j7fofwyvsi54ai", "name": "Christine Nguyen", "photo": "1562740486_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j7fofwyvsi54ai/1562740486_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0ulnglq4ve", "name": "Sakshi Satpathy", "photo": "1564259190_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwu0ulnglq4ve/1564259190_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jyq487ctcwuk8": 1576702519}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jl5gfwcvxxp6mr", "name": "Jessica Yu", "photo": "1576804504_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jl5gfwcvxxp6mr/1576804504_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1525153666, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1527030308, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1525109355, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1539234857}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9v8jj8x141", "name": "Mohammed Shaikh", "photo": "1515230849_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9v8jj8x141/1515230849_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "j7fofwyvsi54ai", "jwu0ulnglq4ve", "jl5gfwcvxxp6mr", "is6p9v8jj8x141"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10728": 1, "1692": 5, "5210": 4, "5321": 2, "5770": 6, "5968": 3, "6841": 7, "6949": 0, "8508": 8, "9533": 9}}, "created": "2020-01-07T19:31:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m torn between\u00a0these two majors, especially since\u00a0both are really similar in requirements.
