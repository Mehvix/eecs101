Will they be comprehensive, fit your schedule, encourage your learning development, adapt their teaching style to you, etc.? Do they prioritize grades, learning, etc.? Do they have a lot of experience?</li><li>You can google them. Most will have a Linkedin which will say what other things they are involved in, whether that could be common interests, clubs, or jobs.\n<ul><li>sometimes it can also be nice to find someone who you identify with, they might have extra advice or resources that apply to you that others who have not been in your position and do not relate to you cannot.</li><li>I also always look for someone who is reputable. CSM is a great organization, but they also give all their mentors training and have a semi-rigorous application process. Additionally, someone who has been on a course staff for multiple semesters (even if it&#39;s not the course you want help in) will have experience teaching in this field and has also probably gone through an application that the actual department reviews and approves of. A good grade does not equal good teaching capabilities. Even if they understand the material, it doesn&#39;t always translate into good explanations. Feel free to also ask if they have taken CS 370 or 375 (required course for all TA&#39;s that teaches you how to teach CS). That being said, everyone is different and has different training and experience.</li></ul>\n</li><li>Reach out! A lot of people are willing to discuss over email or even meet (zoom or in-person) as a sort of interview. Ahead of time, make a list of what you want to get out of the tutoring and what you expect from them. See if it lines up. If they aren&#39;t willing to put in the time and effort to accommodate what you want and/or need from them, they probably aren&#39;t the best fit. Also, don&#39;t feel bad about reaching out to multiple people or turning someone down after asking, an email of interest is not a commitment. Not everyone will have the time or ability to work with you, but there are plenty of options.\u00a0</li><li>Additionally, gonna plug CSM because they got me through all my lower divs. It&#39;s small group tutoring (3-8 people depending on the course and demand) once a week with a trained mentor. They do content review and teach an extra discussion style worksheet. Everyone I have met there has been friendly and super helpful, it&#39;s a great supportive community both within sections and out. Everyone there is committed and enjoys teaching. Section enrollment is opening soon-ish (I think) Check them out: <a href=\"https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/</a>\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Good luck!
