If CS 168 is going to be offered again next fall, I might just wait. But if that&#39;s unlikely, it might consider taking EE 122 next semester.</p>", "created": "2015-10-14T06:28:28Z", "subject": "When will CS 168 be offered next?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ifqf297h2q4ng", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 500, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654556296401, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 272}
