As an example, I know for statistics the admissions committee looks at your performance in a class like Math 104 as a measure of your mathematical ability so you need to take it for a letter grade. \n\nClasses like graph theory, number theory, linear algebra, and others that have obvious CS importance really should also be taken for a grade. Others, like abstract algebra, set theory, can probably be taken P/NP without any issue. \n\nFor statistics, I&#39;m pretty certain that there isn&#39;t a course that you can take P/NP without issue, especially if you&#39;re interested in ML since there&#39;s a significant amount of overlap.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-12-25T18:27:03Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10312": 0, "10399": 4, "10462": 6, "3580": 3, "4949": 5, "6574": 2, "7267": 9, "8081": 7, "9071": 1, "9434": 8}}, "created": "2019-12-24T17:22:02Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed", "other", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m a junior EECS major interested in going to grad school.
