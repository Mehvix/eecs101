Also, would you appeal if you missed it by a little and have a pretty strong argument in why you should be able to declare if you did? If you feel like it&#39;d be quite hard to declare (like your midterm 1 missed it by a lot), maybe consider signing up for courses for a different major? But you still have midterm 2 and the final which are 65% so really lot of hope there!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-10-18T01:46:02Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-17T22:38:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "cs-intended", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Are there and tips on deciding what classes I should take if I&#39;m not sure if I will be able to declare cs or not next semester (I am taking the last of the 3 gpa cs lower divs now).
