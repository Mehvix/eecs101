There is a lot of ee and math involved in it. At many times, ee, math, and cs will overlap in many dimensions.\u00a0Math 54 is deprecated by a reason, one of which is the fact that the course is too broad for cs and does not go directly into applications (see Sahai&#39;s psets for ee16a or Maharbiz&#39;s for ee16b to have an idea of whast I am talking about). EE16AB at the least, is a very interesting combo of courses that allows you to understand general ideas that are key for computer science majors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The series explores ideas like system design (ee16ab), page rank (ee16a), locationing/trilateration/ambiguity (ee16a), omp &#43; Gram-Schmidt (ee16a), least squares (ee16a), system linearization &#43; controllability &#43; stability &#43; observability (ee16b), SVD &#43; PCA (ee16b) and signals (ee16b). All of these topics should be familiar to you no matter what you do in Computer Science. Systems (especially design) will come up in 168, 152 and 162. Least squares, SVD, and PCA will come up in 189 and 127. Page Rank will come up in 126. If you plan on working in NLP or anything related to voice recognition or the like, you will at least need to feel comfortable on ee16b material of signals to then delve into the topics of 120 and 123.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Berkeley takes it too chill on ee requirements compared to any public university in any other country in the world. In my country a lot more ee is expected from cs majors and the ee that is taught is way more physical than ee16ab (which, to be completely honest, BARELY touches the mechanical and electrical side of things and mostly reduces to math). Instead of complaining about the requirements try to understand why they are there. EE 16AB have been made the new linear algebra / ee-ish requirements for a reason. The things that are taught in those courses often come up not only in upper div classes but also in real-life applications. EE 16AB is a very low-bar lower bound for the understanding that you should have about these things. You should be aiming for at least both and possibly even one more course in ee just because you are in Berkeley and have basically one of the best eecs departments as a resource</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>P.S.: yes, I am L&amp;S CS and no, I did not do awesome in ee16ab, but I do feel that L&amp;S CS should have more ee</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2018-05-30T02:42:49Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-30T02:10:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhsh3xysihn4a2", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I am not interested at all in EE, so I also took Math 54 instead, and it made more sense for a double with math.
