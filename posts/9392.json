Sastry&#39;s teaching it next semester, and I&#39;m not sure what his thoughts on webcasting are. From what I&#39;ve seen of his lecturing, he favors board work much more than Bajcsy and will likely go deeper into the math/derivations, so depending on your learning\u00a0style this may be better. He&#39;s also got a lot of great stories about most of the material, since he either created it or collaborated with the people who did, so I recommend going just for that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The book is free online but is very dense, so some students find it hard to use.\u00a0Discussion slides will have more examples, so they&#39;ll likely be the most useful. If there&#39;s a lot of interest again and the department gives us money to open more lab sections, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;ll be webcast.</p>", "created": "2019-04-30T07:28:48Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i09a0mpvrV6"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>It depends.
