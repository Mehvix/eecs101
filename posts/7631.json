The person being interviewed, Alex Kouts, advises a lot Bay Area companies\u00a0on how to negotiate. Hopefully it helps you with your offers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jordanharbinger.com/alex-kouts-the-secrets-you-dont-know-about-negotiation-part-one/\">https://www.jordanharbinger.com/alex-kouts-the-secrets-you-dont-know-about-negotiation-part-one/</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll answer a subset of your questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. It depends on what you value. I would suggest you consider base salary the most important. If the company is publicly traded or you can somehow turn around and sell your shares as soon as you receive them on the market, then equity should be considered as cash multiplied by some risk factor. If the company is a startup and you can&#39;t sell your shares on the market, consider the equity worthless (because statistically, it won&#39;t be worth anything in a few years, and if it is, the money you make from sale of equity will likely be less than or equal to the salary pay you gave up. Only rare startups exit with massive valuations). Sign-on bonus should be last in priority (if equity is worth something).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5. Health insurance can be a large expense; make sure that&#39;s covered or find out what you&#39;re expected to contribute per year. Subtract that from your salary offer.</p>\n<p>Look for offers that include 401k matching; it&#39;s just\u00a0as good as a salary increase, especially considering the tax advantages of placing money in a retirement account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6. See 4. I&#39;d say salary, and equity if it&#39;s worth something. Sign-on bonus is just icing on the cake. You can still negotiate it, but realize that salary will have a larger effect on your long-term finances</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8. A good rule of thumb is 12-15% greater than the initial offer. Recruiters always offer you at the bottom of the salary range for a position. Not negotiating this up is just leaving money on the table. Keep in mind, the company spent a lot to recruit you--it&#39;s in their best interest not to lose that investment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>9. Generally, you only want to negotiate an offer once (i.e. get the offer, ask for more, decline or accept).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Again, all these questions are answered in the podcast I linked. I highly recommend it.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "j3qdr6metuj5f4", "updated": "2018-09-18T00:05:59Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/16 - 9/22", "bucket_order": 81, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/16 - 9/22", "bucket_order": 81, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-09-18T16:34:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jm7xutagaf41r6", "subject": "Thank you, Anon!\u00a0", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-09-18T16:34:17Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-09-18T05:01:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jm794ft81nu7iz", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Speaking from personal experience, but I would certainly love to hear what other people have to say</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. I always I keep my recruiters up to date on my deadlines. At worst, they say &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we can&#39;t give you a decision by that date.&#34; I don&#39;t think telling them would hurt your chances in any way if you still express interest in Company Y. Usually though, especially for large companies, recruiters will do their best to expedite the process if they know you have a deadline.</p>\n<p>2. I usually give the names. Assuming this a reputable company that they know (which is true in this case), I figure this will only improve your valuation. I think there is also a greater sense of urgency because it makes the deadline seem more legitimate. &#34;I have an offer from Google&#34; sounds a lot more concrete and believable than &#34;I have an offer from a big company that you would know of&#34;</p>\n<p>3. In my experience, recruiters do ask where else I am applying to or in the process of applying to.

I know that there have been quite a few questions about this on this forum before, but I have some specific questions that I&#39;m interested to know how people handle. I&#39;d appreciate comments / thoughts from multiple people if possible!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. Say that I&#39;m interviewing with companies X and Y, and I get an offer from company X. Say that Company Y is being slow in getting back to me to set a date for the onside interviews. Company X is a big, well-known company.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Should I tell Company Y about the deadline of the offer from Company X?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Should I tell Company Y the <em>name</em> of Company X?<strong>\u00a0</strong>(They will definitely know Company X, but I don&#39;t know if this is normal or not...)</p>\n<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Say that I don&#39;t have a deadline yet from Company X and I&#39;m in the very final stages, where an offer is basically guaranteed. Should I tell Company Y that this is the case (since I don&#39;t really have a <em>deadline</em> yet...)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. How do\u00a0you consider a full job-package. There is base salary &#43; sign-on bonus &#43; equity. Say that the non-money perks are roughly the same, so let&#39;s ignore those.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> How do you compare which offer is better given the 3 data points?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Are there other points you should consider &#39;money-wise&#39;?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(I apologize if this sounds too money-minded, however, I find myself finding it easier to discuss other kinds of negotiations easily on my own. This one is a little... difficult.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. How do you negotiate money? The only thing I really know about this is that you don&#39;t give the first number. But how does it work after that?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Specifically,</p>\n<p><strong>Question 6: </strong>Do you negotiate base, sign-on or equity mostly?\u00a0Does it depend? If so, on what factors?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 7:\u00a0</strong>Say that we&#39;re negotiating base... how do you do it? Say that company X is offering X$ and company Y is offering Y$. First of all, do I disclose to X and Y what each is offering? If not, then do I at least disclose the names of X and Y to each other, now that I have offers from both?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Question 8:\u00a0</strong>Given that we don&#39;t say a first number, how much more should we ask for?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Question 9:\u00a0</strong>Say that company X and company Y both offered the same amount. Now you ask both for more, and X raises it by how much you asked for and\u00a0Y raises it by less. Then you tell Y and they raise it more than X&#39;s. Do you go back to X and tell them to raise it again? I don&#39;t understand how this would work...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and taking the time to answer. I&#39;d be very glad if you&#39;re able to share an answer to any subset of my questions...
