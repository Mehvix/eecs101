I tried changing my discussion section for 127 by going through the &#39;Options&#39; button, but it won&#39;t let me change my section as I&#39;m not enrolled in the course yet. I cannot change the section for the other class since there are no open seats in any other discussion section.</p>\n<p>What can I do in this situation? I don&#39;t want to drop 127 and enroll again because I&#39;m on waitlist number 6, and there is a total waitlist of 34 people now. I&#39;ve emailed Cal Student Central, but I wanted to post here as well in case someone has resolved an issue like this before.
