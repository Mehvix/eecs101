I decided against a CS degree because the only classes I was interested in were the ML courses and 170. However, now that I&#39;ve done some research and talked to some people, apparently to really be able to work in ML you need to hold a graduate degree. Is this necessarily true? Grad schools are the last thing on my mind, and would like to avoid it as much as possible (due to money, time, disinterest, etc.). If so, if I want to work in the tech industry, is it a better idea for me to just take &#34;industry-focused&#34; courses like CS 162, 168, etc.? Thank you for your advice.</p>", "created": "2017-09-22T03:49:16Z", "subject": "Applied Math, CS minor: ML route or &#34;Industry&#34; route?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j7vckhfxb4y4oc", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5030, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654551332194, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz4uczhrpbq164", "name": "Woo Sik (Lewis) Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idq5j7xngdr188", "name": "Boying Li", "photo": "1508788454_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idq5j7xngdr188/1508788454_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isakqfi08sa7ao", "name": "Matthew Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hz4uczhrpbq164", "idq5j7xngdr188", "iscem14kbsu5vi", "isakqfi08sa7ao"], "tags": ["faculty_advising", "lscs", "other", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 472}
