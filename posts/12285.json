Weekly problem sets and iPython Labs, 4-6hrs a week outside of class (though best thing to do is spend 30 min to 1hr every day, since it takes some time to develop the intuition). Class structure is very consistent</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS162 tough class, theres weekly individual coding hws that can be fairly time consuming along with 3 major group projects. There&#39;s also a lot of content covered in the lecture and discussions, so you have to put in the time to doing readings/reviewing lecture notes to understand material. But from what I understand, the stuff I learned is pretty crucial to anything related to software engineering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Weekly hws can take anywhere from 3hrs to 10 hours depending on assignment and how long it takes to debug as well. Start as soon as they are released and don&#39;t underestimate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Projects are a beast of their own, need a good team of 4 students. There are 3 major projects over the semester. For each project, expect to spend 5-10 hrs for understanding the spec and existing code and writing the design doc, then 30 min meeting with TA for design review. Actually coding it up and writing the report can take 15-20 hrs per person (or more, if you get stuck debugging--important to start early and give yourself time!!).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On top of that there is the usual coursework of keeping up with lectures and learning the material, doing discussion worksheets, preparing for exams, etc. Much of the content is new for a majority of student. I&#39;d say in total would spend 5-8 hours a week including lecture time learning the course materials</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS162 is doable with 1 or 2 other techs it will definitely still take a lot of focused effort and determination.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-05-20T08:12:24Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-21T03:18:49Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kag7hbq6bhd66b", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>This schedule might be doable if you are a strong student. Keep in mind that 149 and 162 are both group project classes.

This will force your partners to do more work, and you won&#39;t have been a good partner to them.
