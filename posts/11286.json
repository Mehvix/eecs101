There are plenty of very famous people within robotics and even if they don&#39;t do exactly what you want, conducting research within their groups will open a lot of doors for you. \n\nAlthough take anything I say with a grain of salt since robotics is not the field I&#39;m most involved with, but the best option would probably be take 128 as soon as possible, and courses like 126 and 127 are more essential for machine learning (and to a much lesser extent deep learning and neural networks). I&#39;m of the opinion that 182 is not very useful unless you want to focus on deep learning specifically, rather than AI in general.\n\nWhat you should really do though, is ignore all advice you get here on piazza, and email one of the aforementioned professors (or maybe one of their grad students since they might be more receptive of your emails) and ask them about what are the best courses to take for what you are in interested in.\n\nTLDR: Look at some of the professor that do robotics research, see if it interests you, talk to them/their grad students on what to take, but IMO in order of roughly decreasing importance  (take with a grain of salt) 128, 170,  221A, 126, 127, 226 (very uncertain where to put this one), 189, 182.
