This is why I&#39;ve reiterated that for EECS majors, I fully support and agree with the idea that EE16B should be required, because of the reason you mentioned - it serves as a class that gives a flavor of the EE side.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS majors are not EECS majors, regardless if people like to conflate the two. There are clear differences in how CS and EECS majors on describes, both on their respective webpages, and the other requirements. EE16B should be a choice for those who want to explore the EE side of things. The difference between a choice and a requirement is the requirements are fundamental to the major; which all of the other lower division CS classes are. EE16B Is *not* fundamental to the overarching CS major.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With respect to the leetcode type of people, I fail to see how that is relevant to this. Your argument is that because those people exist, they should be required to take EE16B... because what? You can make the argument with any other class having to do with EE/CS, that it would let them explore other topics. Why not require Data 8, because it would make people explore the Data side? My whole position in these conversations has been let it be a choice. If someone wants to explore the EE side of things, which is not part of the CS major, then by all means. The default shouldn&#39;t be &#34;let&#39;s require it, if you don&#39;t like it, then fine, don&#39;t take any more&#34;.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For your last point, I&#39;m unsure why you&#39;re talking about &#34;liking&#34; the classes. That detracts from the overall point, none of this is about liking the classes or not. It&#39;s about the relevance to the overall major. It&#39;s not &#34;complaining&#34; because I don&#39;t like the course. It&#39;s about whether I think the course itself should be required. I&#39;ll remind you, the semester before I joined Cal (Spring 2016), EE16B wasn&#39;t required, people could use linear algebra (Math 54) in place of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even if someone LOVED EE16B with all their heart, I would still argue that EE16B shouldn&#39;t be a required course for the CS major. That&#39;s fine that you didn&#39;t like CS61A/B - but it would be very hard that both of those courses aren&#39;t fundamental to being a CS major - basically every CS program has some sort of intro to programming and data structures required for the major. The same can&#39;t be said about a similar course to EE16B.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In summary, I believe that if people want to dip their toes into other tangential fields, by all means.

My argument is that people in the CS majors <em>don&#39;t only</em> just consist of people who knew they were going to do CS from the age of 10. The major includes a wide variety of students: those who are CS gods, those who have some experience, and those who don&#39;t have any experience whatsoever. So many students in L&amp;S choose to do CS after 61A and switch into it where before they were majoring in something else completely different. For these students, I&#39;d argue its important to give them as much broad knowledge of what CS is related to for them to see what they like, because they have no idea what they like, and that includes low-level stuff. I&#39;d argue that 16B is not even that far off 61C in terms of how low-level it is. You&#39;re just learning about how those logic gates are created and that&#39;s via transistors and learning how these RC circuits work.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t disagree with your opinion: for several people, it is truly useless. For students like yourself, it seems you never wanted to do EE in your life, and that&#39;s fine, it shouldn&#39;t be a requirement for you. You also have to consider not everyone in the CS major wants to do pure software CS. Some wants to see what else is in CS and part of it is what 61C and EE16B covers. Those who like computer architecture in 61C would benefit from taking a class like 16B as it leads a path to EECS151/152 and what not. I know plenty of people who are in the CS major who take EE120 and EE123 to learn more about signal processing, which is an important part to ML too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The only issue I have with your perspective is that you think CS majors should have a set curriculum from A to B and everyone in the CS major should follow a certain path in terms of &#34;usefulness&#34;. They are not forcing you to dip your toes in the EE field for fun to see the pain of students struggling to put an op-amp circuit on a breadboard. They letting students see the full stack of the major and from there, students can decide which parts are of interests to them and what they want to pursue in the upperdivs and I believe this &#34;see all&#34; approach is good -- give students a complete view of entire thing, and let them pick what they like. I&#39;m willing to bet there are<strong> plenty</strong> of CS major students pursuing the EE side of CS in the L&amp;S major and I know a few of them. All of them enjoyed 16B and had it not be a required class, maybe they would have never discovered that they liked the EE side of CS. Would you want these students in CS majors to be filtered out simply because 16B has no relevance to your interest? The reality today is that EE and CS are more intertwined than we all think. Having additional knowledge of an extra stack below 61C doesn&#39;t hurt -- now students know it exists and if they don&#39;t like it, then just dont go into the stack.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "name": "David Au", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "name": "Ashwin Vangipuram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "name": "Gilbert Feng", "photo": "1611217973_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnpqbvipc2ml/1611217973_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1568151855, "irdpgxf12pr3t1": 1, "jkj72dhu5xf7my": 1541360409, "jyz1vzhx2on2wq": 1568088917, "jzapntwvv074c9": 1569885082, "jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1568151855, "kb74zdsef1y42h": 1597086076}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iq1ocowl1xq6ia", "name": "Kangdi Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jpslgn3m4lsk6": 1555223627, "ke0mwss5bxj4hs": 1600242896}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhobhold1yokb", "name": "Kaushik Sankar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "iq1ocowl1xq6ia", "jhobhold1yokb"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_6", "updated": "2021-02-03T07:28:49Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/31 - 2/6", "bucket_order": 74, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-03T21:53:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kkpyww8njd51a4", "subject": "<p>I agree with the Anon.

I wish I could have taken one of those classes instead of EECS16B. \n\nMy plan for EECS16B was to just do the bare minimum to pass and scrape by with a D- I need my last semester, since at that point my last semester grades don't matter.\n\nHere is my opinion/advice, especially those who are just interested in software, put EECS16B off until your last semester, hope there is a no lab/lite lab option, or take it when there is a no lab/lite lab option and don't let it get in the way of your learning from classes you actually want to take. \n\nI even heavily considered dropping CS for math/data science my very last semester after I had used up enrollment priority that is granted in cs upper divs just to avoid taking EECS16B.\n\nTL; DR: not a fan of 16b\n\nThe course staff are really great in 16B tho and they are trying.\n\nHere is why I think EECS16B is required.

I think another practical reason why the course is required is because it is recommended to take EE16A &#43; EE16B early in order to build &#34;mathematical maturity&#34;, which then smooths the transition to CS 70. You can disagree on its effectiveness, but 61A, 61B, and 61C don&#39;t really involve much math at all (but of course are still fairly rigorous/difficult). Getting some more practice manipulating symbolic equations/being introduced to proofs before CS 70 is helpful, and of course both EECS and CS majors have to take that course.</p>\n<p><br />Also it seems like the main issue you have with 16B is &#34;relevance.&#34; I think this is where I would actually agree with you. Even the most &#34;relevant&#34; topics like PCA, SVD, Spectral Theorem, DFT, etc. are probably irrelevant to the CS major that has no interest in algorithms or ML (broadly speaking); however, because most EECS/CS majors <em>are</em> actually interested in both of these topics it behooves the department to make this a part of the official curriculum and put their own spin on the material. Also I think 16B did a good job of preparing for ML, although classes like 126/127 are more useful. </p>\n<p><br />Also EE16A &#43; EE16B are designed to cover Math 54 through applications, where the application highlights the underlying/central linear algebra concept (like OMP and least squares, for example). I personally transferred to Berkeley and ended up taking a linear algebra course at community college as well as EE16A, EE16B, Math 110, and CS 189; I found EE16B gave me a completely fresh perspective on linear algebra (shout out to Spring 2019 Sahai lectures, especially with the controllable canonical form derivation -- seriously check out <a href=\"https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all his lectures from Spring 2019</a>, really great stuff; roughly weeks 4-6, CCF is Lecture 6B I believe). However I did take Math 110 at the same time and CS 189 after, so perhaps that might have skewed my opinion.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "name": "Gilbert Feng", "photo": "1611217973_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnpqbvipc2ml/1611217973_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "jzlnpqbvipc2ml"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_7", "updated": "2021-02-03T07:43:04Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/31 - 2/6", "bucket_order": 74, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-03T21:28:05Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kkpxzwcrou3lr", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>For CS/DS majors (i.e not EECS) Math 54 &#43; Math 110 seems like a much better combo than the 16AB series.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeuo00hhpg1im", "name": "Owen Long", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "name": "Owen Bai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1650834395_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1650834395_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1639470636}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvf60vo6k45y", "name": "Sylvia Jin", "photo": "1603007012_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvf60vo6k45y/1603007012_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbeuo00hhpg1im", "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "jktvf60vo6k45y"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jjm5sqotm026wq", "updated": "2021-02-03T21:28:05Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-04T05:45:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>To build mathematical maturity and develop an appreciation for the broad fields in EECS</p>", "created": "2021-02-04T05:45:24Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_9"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kkqfrgmap2s1", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1568151855, "irdpgxf12pr3t1": 1, "jkj72dhu5xf7my": 1541360409, "jyz1vzhx2on2wq": 1568088917, "jzapntwvv074c9": 1569885082, "jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1568151855, "kb74zdsef1y42h": 1597086076}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iq1ocowl1xq6ia", "name": "Kangdi Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iq1ocowl1xq6ia"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/31 - 2/6", "bucket_order": 74, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/31 - 2/6", "bucket_order": 74, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-05T08:02:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kks047vcsgk1fk", "subject": "<p>Great answer and great insights!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1617387820, "jhk3wp5qvi71bv": 1533542488, "jz2c8op4xqq4z3": 1570518768, "kj9duntmc4w7ib": 1617387820}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6m3yw7hjf92b4", "name": "Kevin Svetlitski", "photo": "1579650374_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6m3yw7hjf92b4/1579650374_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6m3yw7hjf92b4", "jktvex6279x3zb"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "j1hge0e6rt9yo", "updated": "2021-02-05T08:02:58Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-05T04:48:55Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kkrt6o5isab359", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Ex 16B TA for 4 semesters here, some of you might know who I am.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over four semester of teaching, I&#39;ll say that the biggest problem with 16B is its lack of a unified vision and the fact that it&#39;s trying to do too much. In its early stages, EE16B was created as to replace the intro EE 20/40 series which covered Signals (20) / Circuits (40) and to give a more modern take on topics in EE/EECS. However, somewhere along the way, it also tried to teach all of the concepts in Math 54 and do some mathematical training for CS 70 and this is where things start to fall apart.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>So what is the point of EE 16A/B? </strong>Depending on who you ask, you&#39;ll get a different response. Most of the EE faculty seem to think that it&#39;s supposed to be the replacement to 20/40. Some say that it&#39;s a survey course of a hodgepodge of topics, others say that it&#39;s meant to teach fundamental Linear Algebra Concepts, and some even call it an introductory ML class. This also makes each semester so radically different since faculty all have different takes on this as well. Personally, I&#39;m of the opinion that it should a survey course that teaches foundational concepts in EE.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>A bit of history on 16A/B </strong></p>\n<p>In its infancy EE16A was arguably one of the hardest lower-div courses relative to the amount of knowledge you had. CS 162/189 may be hard but EE16A three months out of high school was something else and much more difficult than Math 54. It was all of the Lin Alg in Math 54 &#43; a module on circuits &#43; applications of Lin Alg. 16B on the other hand was still difficult but had a much more satisfying payoff for the students who did well in 16A and maybe took Math 54 before as well (back when it was required).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, they started to tone down 16A for good reasons, and cut material\u00a0but may have over corrected a bit too much so that now Math 54 is now much more comprehensive than 16A when it comes to Linear Algebra. The worst part of this entire situation is that all the fundamental Lin Alg concepts that 16A used to teach such as Change of Basis, Diagonalization, Gram-Schmidt were all now 16B&#39;s responsibility.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, 16B also became way too mathematical, probably in its vision to be support courses to CS 70. Part of the magic of 16B was to think like an Electrical Engineer and find smart solutions to hard problems. However, once it became EECS 16B, (in its effort to appeal to CS majors? idk) tried to do some ML, the course stopped becoming an Electrical Engineering course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Why do CS majors need it? </strong>\u00a0EE and CS are quite related fields and some universities, Berkeley included, choose to have EECS departments. CS majors at other universities have to usually take on EE, Physics, or even Chemistry simply because CS is a technical field. I personally believe these classes exist to make you a rounder and better educated person. However, it&#39;s definitely also a political issue since some faculty believe there is only one straight path to learning and 16B is on that path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Will 16B be useful in my career post-college? Maybe not, but I could say the same for other EECS courses as well. That being said, the class has good moments and valuable insights despite its poor execution. Unfortunately the magic of 16B has faded over the semesters and some of the favorite topics got cut from the class in favor of teaching all the stuff 16A didn&#39;t teach. IMO just bring back Math 54 and 16B can at least try to be great again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What to take out of 16B? </strong>It really depends on your background:</p>\n<ul><li>If you&#39;re a 2nd semester senior, planning on doing work in Software Engineering building Web Apps or BeanFactories all day, probably nothing. Just stop complaining and pass the class lol</li><li>If you&#39;re looking to do stuff in Data Science / ML I&#39;d recommend taking Math 110 before or concurrently since the class does have a lot of good Lin Alg applications.\u00a0</li><li>If you want to do stuff in Computer Hardware, definitely focus on the circuits portion; though 16B Circuits have literally turned into Systems Theory as opposed to practical skills, rip transistors :(</li><li>If you wanna work on robotics, the middle half on Controls is pretty good though 16B somehow manages to teach modern Control Theory past EE128 as opposed to Classical Control.</li><li>If you want to do EE, then don&#39;t be discouraged if you didn&#39;t like this class or 16A, even I don&#39;t consider 16B to be true EE anymore.
