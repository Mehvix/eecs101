I was also a bit intimidated by the level of 126, so one thing that really helped me prepare for this semester was actively reading through the first three chapters of the Bertsekas textbook that 126 uses (doing all examples on my own, doing the starred problems and proofs, and thoroughly reading through solutions for things I got wrong). All of this is available online, and I think doing this really helped probability make sense for me, so this would be helpful regardless of whether you choose to take 140 or 126. I&#39;ll also add that 126 office hours have been much less crowded than 70 office hours so far, so those have actually been invaluable for completing assignments. Also, the 126 TAs are great, and sections this semester are being taught with two TAs (one to lecture and one to answer questions), so that has been very helpful as well.
