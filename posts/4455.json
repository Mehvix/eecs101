If\u00a0you TA for two courses, then you may hold one hour of OH for each\u00a0course, which is the same as holding 2 hours of OH for a split appointment, so the weekly responsibilities might be similar. But you&#39;ll have to grade twice as many exams, attend twice as many meetings, hold twice as many review sessions, prepare for twice as much material, etc. The latter type of responsibilities scale up more than\u00a0simply going from 8 to 20 hours for a single course.
