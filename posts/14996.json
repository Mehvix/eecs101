However, it does have very difficult exams to balance this out (the curve will save you here, so don't worry.) If you have no idea if you like AI or ML, this is a good survey class that teaches you about all of the different aspects of these fields (reinforcement learning, neural networks, etc.)\n\nEE16B is somewhat of a survey class for EE/EECS fields. It is a higher workload class with weekly PS, exams, and labs. Pretty time consuming if you don't know what you are doing. It is a class that you should get out of the way as soon as you can (if you need it to graduate). Would recommend you take EE16B as soon as possible since enrollment gives priority to freshmen and sophomores, and taking it later will be a pain.\n\nReally depends on what classes you are taking along side them and how much time you have for other stuff.</md>", "created": "2021-04-29T18:58:20Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ko392qbo6f814l", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k08ftb77uaf665", "name": "Sage Pierone", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["k08ftb77uaf665"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "plain"}, "created": "2021-04-30T20:34:16Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ko4rxyb2zdx7p5", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "I personally didn&#39;t like 188 and thought 16B was easier even though I was dreading it.
