Don&#39;t let that discourage you from taking it though - it&#39;s a very rewarding class that shows you a lot of interesting extensions and applications of 120 content and Miki is a fantastic teacher who&#39;s as enthusiastic about the subject matter as is humanly possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for choosing only 1 for comm/control, that&#39;s a tough one. My general attitude is to go with the more &#34;fundamental&#34; class (126), but 123&#39;s labs are entirely structured around hands-on Ham radio communication, so there&#39;s probably a lot of value to you in those. I don&#39;t think either is a bad choice if you can only pick one.
