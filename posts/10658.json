I took 140 and 70 together and found it to be a good\u00a0combination. It may be a bit tough at the beginning, but 140 really helped me understand the second half of 70 well and the workload for 70 became pretty light for me towards the end because I spent less time struggling to understand\u00a0the concepts. Of course you&#39;ll get the most out of taking 70 and then 126, but if you&#39;re feeling shaky about your mathematical maturity and need a good grade to declare the major like I did, I think it would be a good idea to take both. Having a solid 140/70 level probability foundation is probably better than barely surviving 126 even if 140 &#43; 70 seems a bit redundant. Also, 140 covers quite a few things that 70 doesn&#39;t teach such as MCMC, MLE, multivariate normals, etc.</p>", "created": "2019-10-31T19:09:11Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>It doesn&#39;t really make sense to me to take stat 140 with cs70.
