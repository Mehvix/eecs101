If I take on the CS major (I'm aware of the GPA cap), would I have a far better time enrolling in these classes? I'm reluctant to drop one of my majors for taking those 3 classes, but they are pretty important to me, as I'd like to get some SWE-relevant skills as well (I'm guessing 170 isn't as imperative for this purpose as 162 is though). </md>", "created": "2021-11-28T20:00:43Z", "subject": "Will the current budget/enrollment problems continue into future semesters?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kwjo3espi06wj", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16150, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539231989, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "lscs", "other", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 426}
