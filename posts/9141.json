Personally, didn&#39;t like his style of lecturing at all, not very organized while lecturing and doesn&#39;t provide many examples to apply theorems/concepts. For the linear algebra portion, I mainly relied on the textbook. For DiffEq&#39;s, since the text is trash, I mainly relied on GSI (try to get a good GSI if possible). Exams were pretty simple but very computationally heavy. Other than a few T/F questions, almost all of the free responses involve many calculations. If you aren&#39;t particularly strong with proofs, I think its easier to do well on Teleman&#39;s exams. Also, he has an exam drop policy to drop your lowest midterm score.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-04-14T23:24:22Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-14T20:12:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "juhd85gnfah1b8", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>For reference,\u00a0Garcia\u00a0and\u00a0Miki Lustig are teaching 61C,\u00a0Constantin Teleman is teaching 54, and Hug is teaching Data 100 if that helps with figuring out how much of a workload it will be!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-04-14T20:12:08Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-14T20:01:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hey,\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was wondering how manageable this class schedule seems.

I\u2019m going to be a junior, and I also want to have time to spend a some serious time on internship recruiting. Would this schedule be too much work to still have a seriously amount of time to dedicate to recruiting? If it would be too much work, does anyone know any tech electives I would be able to substitute for Data 100 to lower the workload, or should I just stick with other 54 and 61C? I\u2019ll \u00a0have to take one semester with with 3 techs, so i was thinking this would be the lightest time to take the 3 before I\u2019m taking all all upper divs. Any advice would be really great!\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-04-14T20:01:21Z", "subject": "Math 54 &#43; 61C &#43; Data 100", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "juhcuapo9dhot", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9141, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546870814, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["peer_directed", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 187}
