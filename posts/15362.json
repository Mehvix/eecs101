I actually petitioned to use EECS 126 to count for my last 4 units of the CS requirement. I haven&#39;t received a response yet, but as a back up I am enrolled in CS 194-100 (Social Justice in EECS) which does fulfill 4 units of CS upper division. I&#39;ve looked through the course content and it looks more like a writing/reading-focused course (not technical at all) and the workload seems fairly light, so I don&#39;t think the addition of that course to any of the schedules I&#39;m currently considering would make much of a difference workload wise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve\u00a0 already completed stat 134 and EECS 126. The courses overlapped a lot, but I took stat 134 in Summer 2018 and I took EECS 126 last semester, so the review in the beginning of 126 was helpful haha.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think EE 130 is the course I&#39;m going to prioritize, but I&#39;m wondering if adding on EE 105 or CS 170 would be too much. The schedules I&#39;m considering the most are (1) CS 61C, EE 130, CS 194-100, (2) CS 61C, EE 105, EE 130, CS 194-100 , and (3) CS 61C, EE 130, CS 170. I&#39;ve taken 3 techs pretty consistently and I&#39;ve taken 4 techs once which was doable, but a little too much. I just know 61C has a high workload, so I want to keep that in mind. I definitely want to prioritize the EE fundamental courses, but as you have mentioned (and what I&#39;ve heard from others) is that one could learn the 105 material on their own and take 130. I&#39;m pretty decent at learning the material on my own, so if 105 isnt really a necessity for a good foundation then I can take CS 170 instead which is a course I&#39;m definitely interested in as well. I think the only reason I&#39;m still not quite certain in my decision is because I think 105 provides more hands-on circuit design opportunities. I&#39;ve noticed that in the research opportunities I&#39;ve had so far, I&#39;m not very confident working in a lab. I enjoyed the labs in EE 16B and I seem to enjoy circuit design, but I just haven&#39;t had a lot of opportunities to get confident. I think the course that would actually be the most useful to the MRI research I&#39;ve been focused on lately would be EE 142, but since 105 is a pretty necessary prereq for that course, I was planning to take the equivalent of 142 in grad school.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-07-22T01:25:55Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/18 - 7/24", "bucket_order": 32, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-07-22T01:35:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kre8spo78r667b", "subject": "<p>Actually I&#39;m mistaken, EE 105 is a prereq of 140 and 140 is a prereq of 142, so I should also take the equivalent of 140 in grad school first before 142.
