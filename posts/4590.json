The focus on modeling and components of systematic thinking is stronger in 16AB, and the course sequence was designed to build these up. Remember, one of the main creators of the 16 sequence, Prof. Gireeja Ranade, had experience guest teaching in 70 before she came up with the ideas for 16. There are many subtle linkages that might not be visible to students. (And that&#39;s fine --- we just want you to get stronger. We don&#39;t need you to understand why you are getting stronger.) Strictly content wise, there is a connection between polynomial material in 16B with polynomial material in 70, as well as between least-squares material across 16A and 70.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-07-27T03:44:07Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j5lwaav91is44d", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8g2digd7hh", "name": "Riley Shanahan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p8g2digd7hh"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-07-27T01:06:49Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "cs", "16a"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am aware that the CS department recommends taking EE 16A before CS 70, and choosing to take EE 16A over Math 54.
