I am biased but I think that this classification is an injustice to the class. The class definitely teaches you the understanding of the current protocols and architecture so one could boil it down to such at a glance but in reality, these are only taught because they are expected out of such a class. Scott, who teaches it almost exclusively, tries to focus heavily on theoretical underpinnings and challenges that come with networking and then uses the current protocols and architecture as case studies on what fundamental challenges people were solving as well as some fundamental flaws in the design that may or may not be solvable as well. If you are interested in understanding the internet, I would definitely take this class. at the most basic level, CS168 is a design and architecture class and EE122, from what I know, is an engineering and systems class. If you are specifically interested in an understanding of the internet architecture and design, CS168 should be provide you with the fundamentals. if you also want an engineering perspective on networking, take EE122.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-12-10T22:05:43Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Took EE122 last spring.
