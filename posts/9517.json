That being said, 105 is broader in scope than 151 and strictly more manageable. 151&#39;s project is frankly brutal and, conceptually, while it isn&#39;t the hardest, it certainly isn&#39;t easy either -- after all, 151 was formed from the merger of CS 150 and EE 141, which remain distinct classes at many universities.
