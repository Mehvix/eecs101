I spend lot of time thinking about what will happen if I don&#39;t meet the gpa cut off . So my question is if end up declaring applied math(with cs cluster) , will it hurt my chances getting into machine learning research or master in cs with focus in AI and machine learning.\u00a0 Also will it hurt my job prospects as a software engineer ?
