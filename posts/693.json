I&#39;m currently taking Stats 134 p/np because I&#39;m taking an incredibly heavy workload and had very little time to devote for that class.I should&#39;ve planned out my schedule better the beginning of this semester. Unfortunately, it looks like I&#39;m in danger of failing this class at the moment. Given that a failed class doesn&#39;t count towards your gpa, and that my GPA is pretty good (3.59), how worried should I be about this NP in Stats 134? I \u00a0have ample outside experience, including internships after my 1st and 2nd years. Also, given the fact that internship employers typically only see your trasncript after the offer, should I mention it anytime before the offer that I failed a class?
