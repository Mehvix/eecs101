So a lab will only have a specific number of workstations and is capped at a smaller number of students, while discussion sections can be in a classroom and can accommodate more.

For example, if there are 2 labs each capped at 20 and 2 discussions each capped at 30, then maybe 25 students would pick discussion 1 because it fits better with their schedule.
