Make your resume/LinkedIn well designed with ton of cool content. This takes a lot of steps, i&#39;m happy to help if you wanna email me, but utilize career center, Internet, and friends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Interview Prep. I personally started with Cracking Coding Interview, then Leetcode and Hackerrank. I personally do interviews in Java, I think lots of people do Python as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. Referrals are cool, and you go to Cal, so plenty of alumni and friends probably working at Google or will eventually :) Go to their info sessions and check them out at Career Fairs. Even if you don&#39;t get accepted today, you definitely could in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. Don&#39;t neglect behavior Qs! I think being a nice person is just a great ROI for life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5. Continue taking CS courses you&#39;re interested in, try to build some side projects and improve your coding skills(skills meaning you can improve them, you&#39;re not born a CS beast and there is no plateau).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Taking more CS courses can help you gain knowledge in many ways, which as a result, would help you. With that being said, I feel 61B material is more than enough! Other classes might be useful for particular specializations like ML(Taking 61B would not be enough for ML Engineering job for most positions, i&#39;d imagine).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6unggda5ox", "updated": "2018-10-17T21:53:13Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-16T03:38:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Would I be able to get a software job at big companies such as Google if I only take CS 61B, CS 70, DATA 100, and CS 170?
