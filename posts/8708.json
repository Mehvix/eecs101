The key is actually watching lecture and identifying everything you don&#39;t understand, attempting to figure it out on your own through google, or past readings, or some simple practice problems you can find online. If you still don&#39;t understand, write it down and ask on piazza. Then, when you have discussion or your tutoring session, lay them all out. This is why I personally webcast, so I can pause and go back.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I had trouble understanding concepts watching lectures because I felt, a lot of times, concepts were explained without much detail, and then we were expected to understand. By writing down all my questions and trying to figure them out, I was later able to understand the material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I see he&#39;s still a TA for 61C, so I highly recommend asking him for help.
