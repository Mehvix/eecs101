I took 70 and 61B before 170 and still found the HWs in 170 to be pretty challenging and the proofs still pretty hard since they require a level of mathematical maturity that people often underestimate. For instance, HWs will give you a problem (usually a little to much harder than exam and textbook problems) and tell you to come up with an algorithm provide a proof and precise runtime, with little/no guidance or examples, and there&#39;s usually at least a few of these questions per homework. They are never exactly like something you see in lecture, only somewhat similar, so if you aren&#39;t practiced at proofs you may have a hard time since you won&#39;t get many examples to emulate either. Many of the examples of proofs you do see in lecture are the proof of a certain algorithm you&#39;re learning about itself and thus it&#39;s way beyond the scope of the course. If you don&#39;t see yourself having the time to go to OH all the time or don&#39;t have many people who could help you through HWs it could be pretty rough. Exam problems are easier than the HWs and involve less on-the-spot proving something, but the experience you get from having to do quick logical processing from CS70 exams does help, and you don&#39;t get this from 61B. 61B is the main prereq. bc the content is directly expanded upon in 170 and because 61B provides practice with coming up with solutions to problems and trying to optimize somewhat.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2020-04-16T02:30:48Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10211": 8, "11292": 1, "3650": 3, "3711": 9, "4717": 5, "5197": 6, "6196": 0, "6614": 2, "7539": 4, "8343": 7}}, "created": "2020-04-15T23:06:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I really want to take CS170 during the fall, but have not taken CS70 or Math 55 before.
