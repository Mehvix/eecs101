The hard part is getting in, I think.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Directly becoming a uGSI without serving in course staff is certainly possible, but rare.</p>\n<p>Having experience as lab assistants, tutors, or readers (for the latter, especially for more problem-set heavy courses like 70 or 170 where they hire more readers and readers also interact with students more) certainly helps, especially for that class in particular and especially if you stand out when doing so. (I suppose you can think of it as seeking a promotion.) At least in the past, a semester as part of the course staff was\u00a0usually enough to identify who would be a good TA.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll add something not mentioned previously, which is that it&#39;s most easy to become a first-time TA (especially without course staff experience) during the summer, because many regular TAs / stronger candidates are doing internships instead, so the labor supply is much smaller. (Of course, you might prefer an internship as well; it works both ways.) My first time as a TA was during the summer for CS70, and all of the TAs (except for the head TA) were first-time TAs. (Two were grad students, but the rest were undergrads, and I don&#39;t think any of the others besides myself had been a reader for CS70 previously.)</p>\n<p>And, of course, grades matter. (I recall in one instance\u00a0where an A was a hard cutoff and the instructor didn&#39;t offer interviews to anyone below that.) Probably less if you had course staff experience with the class and/or TA experience in a different class.</p>", "created": "2018-01-04T04:21:44Z", "subject": "", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>1.
