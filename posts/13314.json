The material goes much deeper and therefore more time is required to get sufficient passes over the material before understanding is achieved. Many (though not all) also benefit in 16A from having previous linear algebra experience which makes initial impressions of 16A feel more manageable, while 16B will likely be almost entirely new material throughout the course if you haven&#39;t taken classes in EE, controls, and linear algebra beyond the scope of 16B. The class is very rewarding and exposes you to principles and techniques across many disciplines within EECS and therefore covers quite a bit of material, so the pace of the class is a bit rapid. The same techniques that make you successful in other high-workload lower-div classes will also make you successful in 16B. However (and this is a big however), there is much less cross-over between lecture and discussion in 16B as compared to 16A in my opinion, and therefore you must attend every lecture and discussion, or you will certainly fall behind.</p>", "created": "2020-10-12T18:43:45Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kg6vxgqcmb96x9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrzcn2opc4m9", "name": "Dany Itani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j3nrzcn2opc4m9"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/11 - 10/17", "bucket_order": 11, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-10-14T02:28:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kg8ryrmiaet1yc", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Im in the same boat as you, taking 16B my last semester! if there is any study group i would love to be added :)\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrzcn2opc4m9", "name": "Dany Itani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j3nrzcn2opc4m9"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jc8m2zymu0y4fm", "updated": "2020-10-14T02:28:20Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11615": 8, "12063": 2, "13157": 7, "1537": 4, "2256": 1, "3372": 6, "4323": 9, "556": 0, "5769": 5, "959": 3}}, "created": "2020-10-12T07:22:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Just wondering if anyone would like to make a study group for 16B this spring.
