Currently, I need a coder to assist my business partner in coding because of the lack of expertise on cs on my end. We are using elixir, javascript, and Postsql. Most important is having a background and ample experience in using Elixir. Additionally, we are looking for someone who not only knows Elixir, but is passionate about business, wants to contribute to the team, motivated to succeed, and does not give up easily. Please feel free to reach out to me on my number, 408-329-3799, or my email at dyun1@babson.edu.
