Stat140 is partially advertised as prep for courses like data102 and CS189 (the textbook is great). 126 introduces probability more theoretically and then goes into more interesting engineering and ML applications, and is overall the more difficult but imo rewarding) course over 140 because you have a deeper understanding. Its a killer course though, but its significance is more far reaching than ML. So do a little more research on those courses and pick which one you want to take depending on your focus (a sizable chunk of people even take 140 as prep for 126 because 126 is so grindy, I didnt though, and im doing alright as an average student). A final word on these courses, if you really like 126 and probability, there is a whole world of courses that rely on probability that are more than ML and the like. Lots of stochastic signal processing courses, systems theory, robotics applications, etc... So I think a probability course and 16b (which I dont really like as a class tbh) unlock lots of cool courses as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Data100 is (imo) an interesting medium workload course that has interesting projects and teaches you basically everything you need to do meaningful data science on your own at an amateur level. Its a cool class, even if its not really important to take, I think the main positive is that they teach you how to use real world tools instead of just theory. Also gives you a gentle exposure to basic topics you might go more indepth on in a class like 16b, 127 or 189. I think its a really great class for a first upper div in CS (kind of like 188). Although one negative ive seen is that there can be variance depending on the teachers, however the course staff is excellent (Suraj is a great head TA).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I completely agree with comp that your second semester is sooo much more work than the first, and the first is definitely a lot of work, more than I would ever consider in a semester.
