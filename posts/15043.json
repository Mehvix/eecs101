All classes use the same system, with the only difference being reserved seats, which are declared on classes.berkeley.edu. The way it works is if you checked the right box, you&#39;ll enroll into the class if you have there&#39;s room for you and put onto the waitlist if you don&#39;t. Always check the box that says put on waitlist if class is full.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-05-03T03:03:53Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11692": 2, "11910": 1, "12063": 9, "14600": 4, "14772": 5, "14786": 6, "2256": 7, "4305": 3, "5769": 8, "6923": 0}}, "created": "2021-05-01T07:31:49Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments", "cs-intended", "other", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m not sure how eecs class enrollment or major declaration works in CoE, I entered as BioE but I want to double major with EECS or CS.
