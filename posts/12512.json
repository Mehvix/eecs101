I personally think that combining 61C and 170 will be harder than putting 61C&#43;100&#43;188 together, just because both 61C and 170 demand many hours a week. 61C and 170 is still possible though and many people have done it before. Lastly, I would not recommend taking 16A&#43;16B simultaneously just because you might have to spend many hours a week doing lab for both classes, and 16B obviously expects that you carry in knowledge from 16A as a prerequisite.

Considering taking 100, 188 and 61C along with a light breadth. Though I have never done 3 technicals earlier, I have heard 100 and 188 are kinda light, so I thought it would be a good idea to take these 2 together during a semester where I am taking 3 technicals. Was initially considering 16A/16B/170 (tilting towards 170) but I don&#39;t want to do it online. Can people provide feedback on both the workloads (ignore 16A and 16B for now) and give suggestions.
