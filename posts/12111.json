However, to receive credit for a class, you only need a D- (or higher). So if you take the class graded and get a D- (which could correspond to an NP), you can still graduate, but if you took it on a P/NP basis you wouldn&#39;t be able to. I&#39;d suggest checking with an advisor to confirm what I&#39;m saying, but I suggest taking it for a grade and then asking the prof to give you at least a D- instead of an F in the worst case. Presumably they&#39;ll be generous enough to do at least that</p>", "created": "2020-05-01T06:39:11Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6ij45p75m92r7"}], "id": "k9nttyla6ts4e5", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jqzwzrhx76x2dq", "name": "Ellen Kwok", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkfr8wxmo61w9", "name": "Ana Nelson", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jqzwzrhx76x2dq", "ipkfr8wxmo61w9"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11050": 1, "11546": 4, "11615": 7, "2007": 0, "2368": 5, "3578": 2, "478": 9, "7141": 8, "7538": 6, "7640": 3}}, "created": "2020-05-01T06:04:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>For context, I am a graduating senior.
