Math 185 I would recommend anybody to take if you&#39;ve suffered through 104, since 185 is the reward; the theorem&#39;s introduced in the class are quite astounding compared to the annoying counter examples found in real analysis, but so far the residue theorem or Laurent series expnasion haven&#39;t really helped me out in my research yet. Some people will recommend measure theoretic probability if you&#39;re more interested in the probability side, so Math 105/202A and Stat 205A are also good choices.\n\nEchoing the other followup, I don&#39;t think 281 is that helpful for doing research, and your time would be better suited taking 210A/B or 227B/C.
