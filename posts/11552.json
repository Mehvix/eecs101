I know plenty of people who have used this program to get good positions in industry and/or build their CVs for admission to competitive PhD programs (e.g. Stanford, Berkeley).

As someone who has been conducting research for approx. a year, I really like the kind of research I&#39;m doing and would love to continue with it. However, I&#39;ve never really desired to go into academia so even if I do pursue a PhD I would like to move into industry and work on interesting problems in industrial research labs. However, I&#39;m not sure whether I want to commit the ~6 years a PhD generally requires and if I would still enjoy similar research when I have to do it for such a long period of time. The benefit, of course, is that it would open doors for me to do more interesting, challenging work.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In comparison, the other option is that I decide to directly enter industry and start working. It appeals to me because I would be able to immediately start earning and I also found my last internship pretty fun. The downside, however, is that I may be restricting myself to work that may not be as interesting or challenging. Moreover, a few years down the road, I may be stuck on the progression ladder since lacking a better qualification than a Bachelors may not allow me to go for those specialized roles.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hence,\u00a0could anybody who&#39;s been through such a situation provide some guidance or tips?
