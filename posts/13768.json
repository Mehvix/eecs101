And I would keep trying in future semesters if it does not work out. The policy seems to be that 16B needs to be taken before declaring, so now the right thing is being done by first letting seniors who absolutely need to get in. I&#39;d expect that once they&#39;ve given them a change to enroll, they&#39;ll work backward by class level (letting in juniors, then sophomores). So I wouldn&#39;t tell you to just give up trying to get in until you are a senior since it seems like they want you to take the course as early as possible (and many will drop the course in the first weeks for various reasons, as I had done myself as a freshman--regrettably). You should, however, make note of your situation, in case you do become a senior and someone tries to ask you &#34;you had 6 semesters to do so, why didn&#39;t you take it earlier.&#34; It seems that these kinds of enrollment situations are just encouraging more L&amp;S CS students to put it off until last minute because it seems pointless to try to get in before that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A note to L&amp;S freshman hoping to declare, especially since this remote situation might mean you are getting less help from peers/staff:<strong> take 16B before you declare</strong>, and don&#39;t drop it unless you are doing far more poorly than would be normal for you. And even in that case, just take it the following semester and declare during that semester or later. I was a perfectionist and felt like I was not doing as well as I had in my other classes (not doing <em>that</em> bad actually) and dropped it. I did not know what the consequences would be, I just wanted to be declared ASAP and take CS 170, get an internship with that, yada yada... Looking back, rushing to declare eased my anxiety (which is very important, don&#39;t get me wrong, and administration/faculty should not laugh at the anxiety caused for L&amp;S CS students to declare), but did not make a practical difference in enrollment/getting a summer job (it turned out I could have gotten into 170 anyway, and I knew undeclared friends who got into other UDs too). If you get 16B out of the way, even if it isn&#39;t the most interesting/useful class for whatever you end up doing later, it will save you the stress of these poor seniors (might as well include my future self since I am not close to the front of the WL), and it will also help save room for others in later semesters.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I do hope they just make 16B a declaration requirement or make it a <em>hard</em> prerequisite for CS 70, instead of just citing a couple of emails/bullet points on some web page/faculty anecdotes that urge students to take it before declaring for pedagogical reasons. It is clear that new, excited students at UCB formulate their own ideas about courses they want to take/when, and do not like being told (on top of the 3-course declaration requirement which is already a lot!) when to take what (isn&#39;t the will to explore widely different disciplines whole point of being an L&amp;S student?). If faculty are upset that students are rushing to declare instead of taking their time with the LDs, they should just block enrollment early on, make them take 16B before 70, instead of blocking enrollment for senior students whose situations are far less flexible. This issue wouldn&#39;t even have existed if they didn&#39;t just make taking 16B before 70 a <em>hard</em> requirement to begin with.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-11-25T03:43:18Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-26T10:51:41Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "khypvpfh4907k9", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>if your lab section is full drop and re-add. being number 1 on the WL for a full lab you will be skipped and the people who are waiting on open labs will get in ahead.
