Maybe #1 and #4 could take 5 hours, but 2, 3, and 5 are very difficult to debug and hard to find your errors, and many times, understand spec. Some people may find it easy and 10-20 hour doable, and yes,, class was curved really well, but those projects can take a long time. #1 took me 1 hour for all but one problem, and 3 hours overall. 4 took me 5-10. 2 took me 15-20. 3 and 5 took me a very long time as I had a tough time figuring spec out, and consequently, spent days debugging. Office hours, you\u2019ll get helped once and it won\u2019t be long. If you have a bug, especially for 3 and 5, chances are the TAs won\u2019t find it.

The idea is you\u2019re less stressed if you are stuck on problem X on day 1 vs day 7. Also, you\u2019ll have more time to work on problems if you start earlier. If you start missing one lecture here and there, with 3 techs, it will turn into 2, then 3, then 10 missed lectures and cramming won\u2019t help you. You\u2019ll probably have tons of times in which you\u2019d rather go to office hours or work on a hw instead of lecture, don\u2019t do that. I did and it really wasn\u2019t good.
