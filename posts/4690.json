The traditional foundation of an engineering education, good physics courses just make you stronger.</li><li>Physics training helps in modeling problems and in seeing where mathematical definitions are coming from, and helps refine\u00a0a physical/mathematical intuition. In the Berkeley context, one of the reasons that we now recommend the EE16AB series\u00a0to all incoming freshmen in EECS and intended CS is for hitting both (1) and (2) above. Most places have nothing like this for vanilla CS degrees.\u00a0</li><li>More advanced topics in Physics like upper-division courses in classical mechanics as well as statistical mechanics bring in the connection to optimization and minimization principles. Upper-division electromagnetism courses also help one internalize the idea of dropping terms and trying to zoom in on the quantitative essence of a problem. There is a reason that EE16AB have an optimization thread running through them, but as freshmen courses, they cannot exercise the skills involved in aggressively dropping terms and caricaturing problems. (EE105 does that in the context of circuit theory.)</li></ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, in the Berkeley context, if you&#39;re interested in AI/ML, remember the core courses from our department: 16A, 16B, 70, 126, 127, 189. Ideally taken in roughly that order. Outside of our department, you definitely should be taking Math 110. It is recommended that you take Physics 7A and 7B as well (there&#39;s a reason they&#39;re required for EECS). Ideally, you would also take upper-division classical mechanics and statistical mechanics, but exposure to other upper-division or graduate courses in EE can also exercise the same mental muscles. And of course, within the department at the upper-div, we have courses like 188, 128, 106AB, as well as graduate courses like 229A that are accessible to well prepared undergrads and extremely helpful for ML/AI type thinking.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-06T23:48:35Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j61dprvorwyba", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false,
