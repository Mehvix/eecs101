It is poorly taught and less staff support. The material is pretty abstract and highly exam focused. Not really useful for ML/AI. However, putting yourself through that class gives you a mathematical maturity. Professors usually don&#39;t teach the sort of proof required for exams. So you have to do random homework questions and often the case you might not able to do everything for every single week and take the weekly quizzes. So if you want to really learn math, always go for the classes with better staff-support. One math class that will be really helpful for AI/ML is Math 104. Several Grad students personally recommended that class. Again abstract proving but more worth it. My opinion is suitable for someone who is above average in Math and want to learn the content by working through the material. However, if you are pretty comfortable with abstract proving, go for it.

The usefulness of 170 in the context of industry is based on the need to develop the intuition to solve interview problems for SWE positions, a lot of which are algorithmic and a fair portion of which make use of concepts such as BFS/DFS/Greedy/DP/Divide &amp; Conquer. \u00a0Beyond these concepts, everything else is usually too theoretical to be tested in a regular SWE interview. Now you may think that since half the course is crucial to interviewing, you might as well be better off taking it. However, in my personal experience, even the concepts that were useful were taught/explained in a manner that is too theoretical for the purposes of interviewing with the exception of maybe DP, since the recurrence relations are really the core of the algorithm and those are more or less the same as the pseudocode. If you want to develop intuition to solve the kinds of problems asked in interviews in an interview setting, I would recommend self-studying the relevant portions of 170 and practicing problems topic-wise from Leetcode/Hackerrank instead, which are a more accurate reflection of what interviews will be like.
