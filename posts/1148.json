What should I phase 1? I was thinking 188, as it is very popular, and 120, as \u00a0it is a foundational course that I&#39;m sure fills up quickly. Is this logic sound, or is 120 generally very accommodating, like the EE/CS lower divs? Also, I don&#39;t often hear about a lot of students taking 149, so it seemed like it might be safe to phase 2.
