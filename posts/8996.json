I&#39;ve taken all three classes in question, here are my thoughts:</p>\n<ul><li>CS 162: a project-heavy course with a near-constant workload. Very frequently, projects, homeworks, and midterms will all fall around the same time, meaning you have to be REALLY on top of planning your time to make it work. When going into the class, it&#39;s a good idea to have your group already picked out -- you should be able to work well with your team, otherwise your life will be significantly harder. Pretty doable if it&#39;s your only intense tech, but...</li><li>EECS 151: the single hardest, most intense project I&#39;ve ever completed for a class. In the last 6-7 weeks of the semester,\u00a0the project accounts for ~30 hours a week, and if you&#39;re taking anything else with a large project (like 162) it&#39;s going to be really rough.</li><li>EECS 149: not especially difficult compared to the other two, but it also has a final project that can take 15-20 hours per week (varies, since it&#39;s an independent project).</li></ul>\n<p>Even two of these would be a hell of a semester; all three is beyond painful.
