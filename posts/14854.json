It was a very manageable courseload, although it might&#39;ve helped that I had a great team for 164. I can&#39;t compare this class to previous offerings so I don&#39;t know how much easier it&#39;s gotten but I thought it was comparable to CS 162 with Kubiatowicz. 194-15 was really chill, probably because it was the first time the class was offered so the assignments weren&#39;t as fully developed. We had weekly-ish labs, 1-2 week homeworks, and 4 quizzes (with a quiz drop, I believe). Overall, I think most students did really well in this class, and it was (imo) easier than Data 100 when I took it.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d recommend either this combo or 162 &#43; 194-15 (maybe the latter because operating systems is interesting -- and generally more applicable -- and you&#39;re graduating so that might be a higher priority than compilers!).</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcc2lhx5xd", "name": "Neha Dhingra", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhe7ubiy5z0", "name": "Megha Dhingra", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhcc2lhx5xd", "jktvhe7ubiy5z0"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-04-25T08:15:06Z"}], "config": {"editor": "plain", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11593": 0, "12849": 7, "3825": 2, "4296": 9, "6538": 1, "7792": 8, "8781": 5, "9001": 4, "9553": 6, "9841": 3}}, "created": "2021-04-24T22:38:55Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "This is going to be my last semester (so I need time for recruiting ) and the CS course schedule is limited this semester so it seems like my only options are 162, the compilers class, and the 2 special topic courses (computer vision and parallel programming).\nI was wondering if both 162 and the compilers class are very high workload?\nIf I was to take one of 162/compilers and one of the special topics, which 2 would you recommend based on workload?\nMost importantly, which of these 4 is the lowest workload?\nAlso are there any non-cs department, approved courses that you would recommend?\nThanks in advance!", "created": "2021-04-24T22:38:55Z", "subject": "special topics and compilers course recommendations", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "knwbr5djbvd7nx", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 14854, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654540658832, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhe7ubiy5z0", "name": "Megha Dhingra", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdo94dnotzp1e5": 1608068756, "ke3tewrxmn57lj": 1604516868, "kfn3pakx2el278": 1608298900}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ju4j3glepcg39x", "name": "Thee Ho", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1581210147, "jziyku5gomy7aq": 1576285183, "k0g9j3r04edcn": 1575391697, "k5eevxebzpj25b": 1579570570, "k5g56y7yegw5xr": 1581284108, "k5mvapjoenll2": 1586565748, "k5qacftvzwp155": 1585607475, "kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1603637279, "ke609ylh5ap5uv": 1603222682}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jy1rz92rpon1wh", "name": "Akshit Dewan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhe7ubiy5z0", "ju4j3glepcg39x", "jy1rz92rpon1wh"], "tags": ["student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 330}
