It definitely helped since over the summer they go over all of this in one lecture, and then it&#39;s on to proofs the next day. I would maybe look at the propositional logic notes from class or from the Decal, so that you don&#39;t get bogged down by all the new symbols and definitions immediately. Everything else in the class after that gets introduced a bit more in-depth (though yes, summer 70 is a bit of a storm of new concepts).</p>", "created": "2020-05-06T04:35:13Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Look at lectures from past semesters to get some intuition.
