Getting a 5 on the Calc BC exam is definitely not enough, by itself, to have sophomore mathematical maturity. Taking Math 1A and 1B in some cases (for students who pay attention, actually read the book carefully, pay attention in lecture, and understand the proofs instead of just doing the HW and hunting for formulas) is enough to provide sophomore mathematical maturity, but it sometimes isn&#39;t enough. Some people catch up quickly, quite a few\u00a0do not. (I have seen more tears in 70 than I care to remember, and this is a big part of what drove us to create 16AB. We want to stop these tears.) Math 53&amp;54 have historically been better about getting students ready for 70 maturity-wise, but again, can be\u00a0a bit hit or miss. (Not as much as 1AB, but still.) Meanwhile, some students get here straight from high school with the adequate mathematical maturity.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the advent of EECS 16AB, they represent the definitive sense of what defines sophomore mathematical maturity. These are what we officially deem to be the Freshman EECS courses alongside 61AB. And 16AB are on the mathematical track, just like 70 is as a sophomore course. 70 is the third course in the mathy sequence, just like 61C is the third course in the software engineering sequence.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2015-11-06T02:30:58Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "ign1pf23xx94up", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzd1lb5fiuc2sq"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-11-03T01:57:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Math 54 Lecture 1 is very quickly filling up, and since my telebears is not until tomorrow - it is likely that I may not get in.
