Which is a new record for us.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The balloons travelled yesterday from Berkeley to Utah, where transmission seized once the sun has set. Over night they travelled across Colorado, and woke up around 6am PST close to Omaha Nebraska. Today they cruised at 26500\u2019 over Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and just before sunset entered West Virginia airspace.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Tracking link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://aprs.fi/#!call=a/NU6XB-12,a/NU6XB-11,a/NU6XB-13,a/NU6XB-14&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800\">https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FNU6XB-12%2Ca%2FNU6XB-11%2Ca%2FNU6XB-13%2Ca%2FNU6XB-14&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800</a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>As I mentioned earlier, the balloons are equipped with a short-wave radio, which transmits messages at a power of 10mW (barely lights an LED). These transmissions however are bounced by the ionosphere and can reach many thousands of miles. Over the past 24 hours, hour balloons have been heard from in New-Zealand, Hawaii, Alaska, the east and west coast, Iceland and Northern Europe (Map attached). I think it is remarkable!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If you go on the tracking page and click the balloons, you will see a message from our students, which includes this link:\u00a0\u00a0<i><a href=\"http://calham.ml/\">http://calham.ml</a>.</i></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>This link is a Rickroll! (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling</a>).\u00a0</div>\n<div>While passing over central Illinois, our packets were received by station KA3BQE \u2014 Alex Polozoff. Alex saw the packets, clicked on the link and was rickrolled! This made his day and send us an email to let us know! I\u2019m happy we are spreading the go-bears love!.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Prediction: The balloons are predicted to leave North America overnight \u2014 so in the next day, we will only be able to monitor the balloons via the HF (short wave) radio. The predictions are attached below. Each click is 6 hours.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More tomorrow!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Ffa0e2f94b6eab08837f7a87463cc1ba87e60155e5c882fa5d53bb48ff8c8c211%2FWSPR.png\" width=\"642\" height=\"508\" alt=\"\" />\u2014 Miki<img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F20ac6e03de7550abbdabba6312a182a85d2f4ea71427aa177f7d2f227dce82a4%2FvqMP0K-trajplot_169867.pdf\" width=\"595\" height=\"842\" alt=\"\" /></div>", "created": "2022-04-22T04:09:22Z", "subject": "EECS Balloons update day 2:   Never Gonna give you up....or let you down", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l29wyh0zwfq11u", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16896, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538420661, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpbgfwai2ao", "name": "Saurav Banka", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnpbgfwai2ao"], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 325}
