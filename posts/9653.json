If you&#39;re interested in the cross section between STEM and outreach, I&#39;d like to plug in <a href=\"https://pioneers.berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Pioneers in Engineering</a>! We do a lot of different things, but we&#39;re most well known for the annual Robotics Competition we host for local Bay Area high schools in the Spring. It&#39;s similar to FIRST Robotics, if you&#39;re familiar with that, and we aim to provide a great experience and an entry point accessible to under served high schools and communities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some of the things you can do in this club include\u00a0education (working on educational curriculum and managing our outreach programs), engineering (we build a robotics base kit from scratch including all the hardware, software, and programming environment for the students to use), and business (we have a huge budget and are always looking to raise more money for our cause). It&#39;s also not a huge club and it&#39;s super easy to find people who like doing the same things you do! We host a number of socials and really encourage teams and members to get to know each other more! It&#39;s also a volunteer based organization, so we don&#39;t have an application. You can put in a lot of time in to this club and it will be super rewarding, but if you just want to help out a couple hours a week we are also happy to have your help!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The club meets every Wednesday from 7-9 PM, and every Saturday from 1-3 PM during the semester. During the summer we meet only on Saturdays, and our worksessions will be starting soon.
