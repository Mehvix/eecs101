Here&#39;s what we know.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The TAs receiving fee remissions are split into two groups: those who are still enrolled at Cal and those who aren&#39;t. For those who are enrolled, the university has said that they&#39;re hoping to get to get remission back to the first group by the end of June. The main hold-ups are some hiring discrepancies between union records and university records, but to be honest we don&#39;t know much more; the process is being run by central campus, largely without much information provided to either the union or the EECS department. They have also mentioned that the emergency financial aid associated with COVID has slowed the system down, so that&#39;s another reason that things have likely been very slow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#39;ll take longer to get money back to those who aren&#39;t enrolled at Cal anymore. Because many can&#39;t be electronically refunded after decoupling their CalCentral from their financial accounts, the university and union are going to have to carefully reach out to these former TAs and verify identities to prevent fraud. This will take longer and we don&#39;t have an exact timeline on this, but this process shouldn&#39;t interfere with getting money to those still enrolled at the school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feel free to send me an email if you have further questions -- I&#39;m always happy to talk about what we know and what we can do to enforce that the university follows through on this decision. I&#39;d like to also mention that I (and the union) think that these payments are taking far too long with little transparency.
