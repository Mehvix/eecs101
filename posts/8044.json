An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host institution. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where he/she works closely with the faculty and other researchers. Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel. Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions. An REU Site may be at either a US or foreign location.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By using the web page,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp\">Search for an REU Site</a>, you may examine opportunities in the subject areas supported by various NSF units. Also, you may search by keywords to identify sites in particular research areas or with certain features, such as a particular location.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students must contact the individual sites for information and application materials. NSF does not have application materials and does not select student participants. A contact person and contact information is listed for each site.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tiffany\u00a0Reardon,\u00a0Associate Director for Retention Programs for\u00a0Engineering Student Services created the following list of programs:</p>\n<p><strong>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaLXP5lYMEysPzTszmZ46Et2YIDzeBk9aBaMFqOJ8Jk/edit</strong></p>", "created": "2018-10-23T20:48:43Z", "subject": "Summer Research Guide", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jnm7ctrjpl069r", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8044, "num_favorites": 10, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548182392, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 397}
