This is a smart plan to have, in some form or another. However, the strategy of hedging your bets by applying for full-time positions as a back-up to your ideal outcome of grad school does have risks associated with it. You initially mentioned not wanting to break ties with any companies. Well, if you do this then you are potentially doing that. Think of it from the recruiter&#39;s perspective: you&#39;ll have contact with them and if the process gets to the point where you are given an offer, which you accept as a back-up while you wait, only for you to renege when your grad school applications come back then they will have to explain to their boss why the recruitment process needs to start over again. Has this happened before? If it hasn&#39;t, I will willingly eat my clothes. The company probably has a procedure for dealing with it. Does it mean it is consequence free?\u00a0No. There is a possibility (I would think more likely than not) that recruiter will not have nice things to say about you. Companies consist of people, and people work just like your friends would: how would your friends react to being burned by someone they stuck their neck out for? This leads me to another thing that I think is important if you choose to hedge your bets: be honest with people. If they&#39;re asking for dedication, and you know you can&#39;t offer that in full honestly, then don&#39;t try to convince them that you&#39;re dedicated.<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to comment on possible legal ramification as I&#39;m not qualified to do so, but I can definitely imagine some (albeit incredibly contrived) scenarios in which a company ends up knocking on your door due to a series of terrible decisions. Don&#39;t make terrible decisions. What is a terrible decision?
