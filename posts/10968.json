I applied for internships from January - February and it was mostly startups / lesser known companies but people were still recruiting. Very few companies actually explicitly reject you, and I\u2019d expect to only hear back if they\u2019re interested. I only applied for internships once (I ended up teaching / doing research my other summers) but I probably submitted ~80 applications, though many of them took only a couple minutes. How many is reasonable probably depends on how good of a candidate you are and how many options you\u2019d like \u2014 I heard something or another (coding challenge / phone call / interview) from only around 10% of the companies I send applications to. That being said I was not the greatest candidate at the time :)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I could be an atypical case, but for the most part, companies that were interested in me didn\u2019t take all that long to get back to me \u2014 both in my job and my internship searches, I got responses within a couple weeks of applying from the places I ended up interviewing at.\u00a0<br /><br /></p>\n<p>I\u2019d say LinkedIn / cover letter not important (esp. cover letter), Github only important if you actually have something there \u2014 personal projects or open source contributions that a recruiter could take a look at.
