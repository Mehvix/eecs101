Caveat: haven&#39;t taken 16a/b but based on what I&#39;ve heard (and the fact that 16a/b is enough of a prereq for the lin alg in ee127) you should be fine, as long as you commit to keeping up with the material. Don&#39;t fall behind, because everything builds on each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you take it and the structure was like my semester, where the hw weren&#39;t due, definitely be sure to attempt all homework problems - the concepts built in problems were heavily used throughout the semester.
