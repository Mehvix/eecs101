In terms of course structure, this past semester, there were 4 assignments, 2 midterms, and a final project. Each of these sections makes up 30% of the grade and then there&#39;s a 10% participation grade. Overall, the workload for most of the assignments is at a medium-level upper-division class but if you&#39;re\u00a0new to Tensorflow it might be quite a bit more than that even for some of the others. The midterms are straightforward exams and are heavily based on lectures primarily so make sure to attend/watch lectures, and the final project is the most exciting part of the class and for me was very rewarding and engaging! So overall, the workload is not too high since there are only 4 assignments the entire semester and the final project only picks up last 1.5 months of the semester. Would highly recommend this class!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-05-27T19:54:57Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/27 - 6/2", "bucket_order": 97, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/27 - 6/2", "bucket_order": 97, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-29T15:45:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhrusgwdu5m7i7", "subject": "<p>Hmm that&#39;s interesting.
