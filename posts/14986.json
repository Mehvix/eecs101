The pacing, as I'm sure many would agree, is much more comfortable than 16B. You are essentially covering a subset of 16B content but this material is spread across the entire semester so you actually have time to learn everything. 120 does not and to my knowledge has never had a hardware lab, although their Jupyter notebook labs were excellent when I took the class and to my knowledge have only gotten better through great work from course staff. My semester there was one day during lab section that we got to play with synthesizers, make crazy tunes, and see how their sound waves related. It was neat stuff, but I'm not sure if they will bring this back haha.
