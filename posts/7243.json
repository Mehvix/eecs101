Once you have a foundation, it is possible to build on it by self study. Without the foundation, it is very hard to self-study. In other words, it is easiest to self study things that build on other things that you already understand.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What you have described about your background shows a huge gaping hole on the mathematical/conceptual side. No serious probabilistic thinking course and not nearly enough engagement with the linear-algebraic optimization perspective. It is very hard to build that foundation without taking courses, including doing the labs, seeing the synergies between the HW, lecture, and labs, etc...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What will happen if you try is that you will try to understand things through a software development lens rather than internalize the different perspectives that are needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you have had a couple of courses in an area, it is a lot easier to self-study. For example, consider a student who has taken 162 seriously and say something else like 164, on top of mastering 61ABC. Assume they&#39;ve taken 170 as well. At this point, if they were to self-study databases by reading and then doing for themselves the projects from 186 type courses, and then making up their own projects and doing them --- they would be pretty successful. Similarly for teaching themselves security or networking. It will take more effort to self-study than to take a course (that&#39;s always going to be the case --- that&#39;s why we have courses), but it is doable. When people say self-study, they usually mean something less --- self-studying to fill gaps as needed. That can be easier than taking a course, because you are aiming for less.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But imagine if someone had only taken 61A. And a bunch of math courses. And now, they want to teach themselves operating systems. What would that experience be like? They can&#39;t even program properly yet.\u00a0 61A is an amazing course, but there are 6 lower division requirements for a reason including a full trilogy aimed at building software-dev related skills 61ABC.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-07-18T17:50:14Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jjrf9nz7jsu1yq", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6congzb11855f", "name": "Lily Bhattacharjee", "photo": "1566840155_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6congzb11855f/1566840155_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4fjvbi437", "name": "Bill Cao", "photo": "1530143068_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6nu4fjvbi437/1530143068_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6unggda5ox", "name": "Farid Waziri", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7pg67kb6cn", "name": "Brian Truong", "photo": "1472887383_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p7pg67kb6cn/1472887383_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jl5puy89hsg45m": 1539521774}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9d0f5p6m3", "name": "Nikunj Jain", "photo": "1526983210_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9d0f5p6m3/1526983210_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6pa2e9c481b9", "name": "Ashwinee Panda", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzab6kpr3c048h", "name": "Justin Luke", "photo": "1473540382_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzab6kpr3c048h/1473540382_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3zadxpy7594", "name": "Viraj Attre", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrikvwjdha45m", "name": "Nico Camerino", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0q7ryrxxp43", "name": "Sreyas N", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewijx93v2sc", "name": "Jay Shenoy", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrin4yxhispa", "name": "Lakshya Jain", "photo": "1474747210_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idrin4yxhispa/1474747210_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgxn2bii5hp", "name": "Ji Hwan Min", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6congzb11855f", "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "j6nu4fjvbi437", "is6p6unggda5ox", "is6p7pg67kb6cn", "is6p9d0f5p6m3", "is6pa2e9c481b9", "hzab6kpr3c048h", "j3l3zadxpy7594", "idrikvwjdha45m", "iy0q7ryrxxp43", "j6lewijx93v2sc", "idrin4yxhispa", "jktvgxn2bii5hp", "is6p6uis14y5ot"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-20T22:26:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjuk0y8pb9i4te", "subject": "I&#39;ll look into the MS, thanks.
