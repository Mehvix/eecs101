The swap has been pending since then because I&#39;m still on the waitlist for 189, but I decided that I wanted to stay in both 161 and 189, so today I dropped and reenrolled in 161 (in hopes that this would nullify the swap). I was wondering if 161 will still be dropped if I get off the waitlist for 189. Looking at previous posts on piazza, people have asked this question before, but nobody has ever given a definitive answer on how dropping and reenrolling the swapped out class affects the swap. The obvious thing to do is to wait and see if I still get the weekly email reminder about the pending swap. However, on a similar thread a year ago, somebody was trying to swap between 162 and another class, and they were on the waitlist for the other class. After dropping 162 (and not reenrolling), they still got the weekly email reminder about the swap, so this does not seem to be a reliable method to\u00a0check if the swap will still occur.</p>", "created": "2018-11-26T20:43:13Z", "subject": "Swap Drop and Reenrolling", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "joys4pohd9n5sm", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8258, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547929766, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j4funyq8116317", "name": "Monica Tang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1551127304, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1518294368, "jhadltur59wtu": 1537154756}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is9bvy3hrcm57w", "name": "Noe Barrell", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j4funyq8116317", "is6p9mf96y2ty", "is9bvy3hrcm57w"], "tags": ["enrollments", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 214}
