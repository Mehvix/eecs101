The first third or so of EE127 is a review of linear algebra, and I think Math 54 is sufficient background for it as long as you take the first third seriously and maybe take time to fill in the gaps that may exist in your knowledge, and you should be ready for the rest of the class, the actual optimization content. \n\nThe experience with Math 104 really depends on the professor and their expectations of what is reasonable of undergraduate students. Usually the class has weekly problem sets (unless you take it with Hadfield) and they take about 10-15 hours each (although this can be as short as an hour if you get everything quickly). However I would recommend that if you take 104, you should take 105 before 202A since 104 alone doesn&#39;t prepare you enough. The other option is to take H104 which might be enough for 202A (although I would avoid it next semester since Wodzicki is teaching it).", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-07-20T15:38:23Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 89, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-20T18:01:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjuak0rtf6c2gp", "subject": "<p>Thank you so much for your kindness!!!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-07-20T18:01:37Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 89, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-20T19:09:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjucz30xrs475c", "subject": "<p>Could original anon comment further on Hadfield/Wodzicki?

He taught H113 for the past three spring semesters; the first and third time he taught he had fairly reasonable expectations of what the class should cover. The second time he had a completely unrealistic belief as to what undergraduates were capable of; by the end of the course he had started talking about Hopf algebras and I (and maybe most of the class?) had no clue what was going on. Week 10 I think he had assigned homework about 20 problems about kernels and cokernels in category theory and a lot of these were very hard questions. I had asked a friend at Harvard who was studying algebraic geometry (and had told me that the 55 series was pretty easy) for help and it took him 3 hours to solve one question (yeah that homework was awful, I also had a 70 midterm the day before and a 61b midterm the day of).\n\nI have not had any experience with him teaching H104, but looking at the content it seems that he mostly focuses on point-set topology, which is great if you want to study that, but for a classical treatment of real analysis that contains metric space topology, differentiation, and Riemann integration I would recommend taking a regular 104 since it would be more useful for fields that require direct application of analysis (like statistics).\n\nAs for Hadfield, my experience with him is H185, and as a whole, he&#39;s a pretty decent professor. He&#39;s entertaining during lecture, and since he does differential geometry he draws plenty of pictures on the board to help with visualizing the theorems presented. However he skips a lot of details in proofs (although this was an honors course) which sometimes are not entirely nontrivial, and there are quite a few typos in his homeworks (and sometimes exams) which causes quite a bit of trouble (like flipping an inequality sign on a homework problem in a situation that is difficult to construct a counter-example).\n\nJust my two cents.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-07-20T19:59:45Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/15 - 7/21", "bucket_order": 89, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-20T20:18:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjufgeq3gi750i", "subject": "<p>Thanks for the detailed answer!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2018-07-20T20:18:47Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-20T01:12:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jjtaigva1bkgl", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Don&#39;t have much research experience personally so take what I say with a grain of salt (mostly comes from my friends).
