This is still in the works, but we&#39;re also looking to expand CalTeach and introduce a CS emphasis. Going through the CalTeach program is a great first step towards becoming a high school CS teacher. Another great course you can take is CS 370: Introduction to Teaching Computer Science, though this focuses more on undergraduate (post-secondary) teaching.\n\nAlso, volunteering with <a href=\"http://www.tealsk12.org/volunteers/\" target=\"_blank\">TEALS</a> is a great way to stay connected to teaching and give back to communities that are often under-resourced while still working in industry. I know a couple people who are in TEALS and it works out well with their schedules: for example, some of their elective CS courses at Bay Area high schools run as a A period between 7:30 and 8:30 AM in the morning, so they really don&#39;t need to sacrifice any of their full-time employment hours to help out.

Our courses explore effective teaching practices and give students the opportunity to apply those practices in local K-12 classrooms.  Through our course pathway, students can earn a Science and Math Education minor while completing both a bachelor&#39;s degree and earning a California Preliminary Teaching Credential as an undergraduate.\n\n<b>How can students begin pursuing our CalTeach minor and teaching credential?</b> To get started, this coming Spring 2019 we will be offering our 2 unit introductory course, UGIS 82. This course allows students to gain hands-on teaching experience, develop lesson planning skills, learn classroom management skills and more.
