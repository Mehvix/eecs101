Since I did not take 16A as well, as soon as I received the email/warning, I enrolled in 16A.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You are right. I should take it as early as possible. However, I do not think 16B is a major requirement or there is a restriction said CS MAJOR MUST TAKE 16B BEFORE JUNIOR YEAR. Maybe there is such a requirement, but as far as I know, I did not see it and regarded 16B and 61C as graduation requirements rather than a major requirement. As far as I know, the warning of 16B is taken place last semester (effective for the class enrollment of this semester), and the warning is not because of the changes in CS major requirement, but instead due to the other issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And one may ask why not take it in my sophomore year. I personally do not think it is a good choice to take a class remotely whose lab needs a real manual operation. At least, it is not the optimal choice given the condition of pandemics. Similarly, if given the condition that it would be extremely difficult to get into 16B due to other issues (for example, funding) (yes, this condition is given at the end of my sophomore year), I would definitely choose to take 16B.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks again since it helps me to clarify my situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdz3o4zvdfq58v", "name": "Yuerou Tang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh1frv8v2z4", "name": "Maniratnam Iyer", "photo": "1602019601_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzdh1frv8v2z4/1602019601_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1637021014_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1637021014_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzepyol4ldt194", "name": "William Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1594444998, "kaww3dlpw6n2fg": 1593711777}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k0wpmcnxwt24px", "name": "MingYuan Ma", "photo": "1593860589_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/k0wpmcnxwt24px/1593860589_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeunuuar0k1fd", "name": "Gina Wu", "photo": "1635566578_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kbeunuuar0k1fd/1635566578_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdv1zzhgyc65sp", "name": "Raymond Tan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdo94dnotzp1e5": 1608068756, "ke3tewrxmn57lj": 1604516868, "kfn3pakx2el278": 1608298900}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ju4j3glepcg39x", "name": "Thee Ho", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ks5n3ohiirb3fk", "name": "Will Tholke", "photo": "1635479015_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ks5n3ohiirb3fk/1635479015_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kdz3o4zvdfq58v", "jzdh1frv8v2z4", "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "jzepyol4ldt194", "k0wpmcnxwt24px", "kbeunuuar0k1fd", "kdv1zzhgyc65sp", "ju4j3glepcg39x", "ks5n3ohiirb3fk"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-11-11T05:40:21Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2021-11-11T05:13:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kvuhwyyyd3t77u", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "You\u2019ve been warned about taking 16B before end of your sophomore year for at least 2 years now, maybe more. \u00a0Why would you have priority?", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jz9gltnmf1358i", "name": "Andrew Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jz9gltnmf1358i"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-11-11T05:13:31Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-11-11T12:36:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>80-90% you\u2019ll get in with the 10% rule.
