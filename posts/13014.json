I&#39;m currently a senior who has the units to graduate this semester and I&#39;ve heard that Operating Systems is a really useful class to take. However, there&#39;s a lot of other more interesting CS/EECS classes that I want to check out and I&#39;m not really sure if CS162 would be worth my time, especially given the workload. As I&#39;ll be recruiting in the fall, I also want to give myself lots of time to prep for interviews in addition to my classes. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve heard that OS questions are quite common in interviews. Am I shooting myself in the foot by pushing it back to the spring? Do recruiters look at the classes you&#39;ve taken in your resume? Alternatively, I was thinking of doing an online OS course for a rudimentary knowledge of that subject area but I don&#39;t know how to put that in my resume. Please let me know your thoughts, thanks!</p>", "created": "2020-08-25T10:11:49Z", "subject": "Unsure about CS162 and how it relates to recruiting", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ke9si7xcf496or", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 2, "nr": 13014, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542687431, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jh6ycuki5d747v", "name": "Khang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1574134997, "jwslfmrdirb540": 1565228726, "jym2724oqrk2bm": 1568516245}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji3ybsgdzii5h7", "name": "Vivrd Prasanna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1592173960_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1592173960_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jgvlc3c0gux2vw", "name": "David Lu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j54get93nrd5e2", "name": "Shayna Kothari", "photo": "1584667849_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j54get93nrd5e2/1584667849_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jh6ycuki5d747v", "ji3ybsgdzii5h7", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "jgvlc3c0gux2vw", "j54get93nrd5e2"], "tags": ["eecs", "enrollments", "other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 500}
