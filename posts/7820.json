I was unable to do anything outside of coursework and I still managed to mess up academically (go me!!). This semester however, I decided to follow a contrasting approach, and got involved in relevant activities such as research, mentoring/teaching, clubs etc. while having a much lighter course load than last semester, and seem to be doing okay-ish (nothing great) academically so far.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Comparing the two approaches to these two semesters of mine at Cal (last Spring and this Fall), it would appear that the latter approach seems to be better suited to me personally as I&#39;ve come to realize that tougher course loads might simply not be for me. Furthermore, I believe that this is only the start of my extracurricular experience at Cal and that with each semester my responsibilities will (hopefully?) grow. This would mean that I would not be able to handle heavy course loads at any given time from now until my time at Cal comes to an end, if I wish to do well in these courses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, since last semester, I had been planning on taking a multitude of EE/CS/generally somewhat relevant courses besides the &#34;core&#34; CS classes (170, 162?, 189 etc.) and had planned my 4-4.5 year schedule as such. While I am still interested in taking as many classes as I can that are remotely useful, I know that I cannot mentally (or physically) handle taking them at such a rate when coupled with other responsibilities, while doing well in them. As enrollment rolls around (this week in fact!), I am left wondering if there is any right path to go down, or if there should be some kind of balance between the two. If it is the latter, how do I find this balance? I&#39;m just confused and somewhat sad that I can&#39;t have my cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>While I want to learn as much as I can that will prove to be useful in (mostly) industry, I also want to do well academically as doing well serves as a positive feedback mechanism for me to learn more voraciously, \u00a0but I also want/need to be involved in relevant activities beyond my coursework because of the experience they provide which I hope will prove to be useful down the road. I&#39;m thus perplexed as to how I should go about my schedule, not just for next Spring but down the road as well. \u00a0/endrant</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Title.\u00a0</strong></p>", "created": "2018-10-14T02:44:58Z", "subject": "Taking fewer courses and doing better vs. taking more courses, feeling pressured and not doing well?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jn89og189jt2vx", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7820, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548500654, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ip7tr8jvrq678u", "name": "William Yang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ip7tr8jvrq678u"], "tags": ["other", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 350}
