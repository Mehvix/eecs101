Since you will already be enrolled in 61A and 16B, there isn&#39;t really anything else lower-div. wise you can take from EE/CS, so you may want to just take some other requirement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is not usually a good idea take an EE/CS upper div alongside CS 70 and CS 61C. Firstly, because most UDs require one or the other, or both; and second, because those three would be an enormous workload on its own, not to mention you have that ME class planned. Most CS students\u2019 first upper div. is CS 170, which is helpful for other EE/CS courses and for getting internships; but you need to take it after completing CS 70 and 61B. But I would take some other requirement, like a college requirement/elective/etc. instead of an upper div that semester, so that you don&#39;t have such a high workload. 61B is really the most helpful of all CS courses (LD and UD) for getting a software internship generally, so there isn&#39;t really a big reason to rush taking an upper div as none of them will be as helpful. I got my first internship after having taken 61B and had not at that point taken any upper divs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the future though, generally 162 is also considered helpful for software engineering internships and for being a software engineer in general as the content is relevant to most SWE positions.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-09-17T05:30:27Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-09-17T07:04:50Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kf6gycnfmxn5ob", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Adding on to Anon&#39;s response, I&#39;d encourage you to ramp up your course load gradually, so you don&#39;t find yourself completely swamped in the middle of a semester because you took too many difficult classes.

Similarly, 61C and 70 are another step from 61A/B and 16B, so 61C, 70, 106, and a breadth is a good plan for you if you feel up to it, but definitely not any more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, I&#39;m not very good at following this advice myself but I&#39;d encourage you to really consider clubs over taking a ton of classes, because they&#39;re great for networking/socializing (especially with the backdrop of everything going on right now) and also can give you some practical experience. In the near-term especially these will be more valuable for you getting an internship than trying to squeeze in an upper div. Of course you want to strike a balance between classes and clubs, but definitely don&#39;t neglect either.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "jzdh11fe3ui2kw", "updated": "2020-09-17T07:04:50Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-09-18T02:12:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kf7ly4uys5s6cb", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>This looks good on its own. 61 series is great for internship prep.
