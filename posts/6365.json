I had just finished 1A/1B (note: hadn&#39;t done 54 yet), and I found the class to be manageable. Problem sets are due twice a week, with an online quiz once a week. The quiz is timed at 2 hours, in which you have to complete 5 questions and scan your work. The quiz is meant to take 1 hour; the extra hour is for technical difficulties. As for material/pacing, I thought Professor Hutchings was fantastic. The lectures are available online, and the support on the Piazza is pretty active. Pacing was comfortable, but it relies on you being disciplined enough to watch lecture when it comes out and start homework immediately. No midterm exams, just one in-person final (can be taken anywhere, just needs to be proctored).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, I thought it was a great class, and an awesome alternative to taking 53 over the semester. Of course, I don&#39;t know what I missed out on by not taking it during the year. One note I must say is that plenty of community colleges over Multivariable Calculus, so if cost is an issue, do the class locally. I&#39;m sure there are online equivalents to Multivariable Calculus as well, but at the expense of not being taught in a Berkeley-level rigor/difficulty. Good luck!</p>", "created": "2018-03-18T21:06:48Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>If you are gonna be here at Berkeley, then\u00a0I&#39;d strongly suggest\u00a0you to\u00a0take the in-class option.
