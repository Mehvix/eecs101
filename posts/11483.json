But, the best way to manage these techs, is prioritize whichever is important whenever. Whenever 16B Psets were due, I used to focus all my attention to completing 16B and when 61B projects were due, my focus was onto that. I would admit being an intended CS major, my focus on 61B was much much greater than 16B, because of the sheer relevance it demands for declaring. I really feel keeping up with lectures for both classes really helps, <strong>attend the lecture in person for both. </strong>For most part, I tried attending the lecture for both in person, so that I didn&#39;t have to spend any time home getting back on track for lectures. Also, if you have chosen the lab option for 16B, it would help you keep grasp of the concepts covered in lecture, because they are always always directly applied in 16B labs, especially the car project. For 61B projects, the only key to finish the project on-time and focus on other lectures, would be to start the day it is released. If you work on it in chunks, they are pretty manageable by the end. But, I give you for Prof. Hilfinger&#39;s projects being notoriously time-consuming. Another very important thing for 16B is to attend HW parties and Office hours, and work with other people over there. This allows you to finish the HWs with the highest amount of support and also keep you in check whether you are caught up with lecture. As I mentioned earlier, the most important thing for 16B is to attend lecture in person and keep up with the material, which allows the problem sets to become much much easier and make you less overwhelmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And experiencing these amounts of stress for Prof. Hilfinger&#39;s 61B and general 16B is not uncommon at all. Everyone I know has experienced this including me. But, to manage them equally well is to do what I mentioned above (in my opinion, I maybe wrong).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For your sickness, write to the Prof. Hilfinger for an extension given that you were sick. He is very considerate about these matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, do not stress about being alone in this struggle between these two techs.</p>\n<p>Follow-up with any questions you have.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jwslfmrdirb540": 1563401585, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1576411252}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "name": "Parth Gupta", "photo": "1567400054_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwu0ujo2fbl4tc/1567400054_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr1fa4dnd9r716", "name": "Katherine Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "name": "Rishi Veerapaneni", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1581703162_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1581703162_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "jr1fa4dnd9r716", "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "jktvhcjpozd5xg"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "updated": "2020-03-07T20:31:07Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10389": 5, "10502": 8, "11267": 0, "3264": 4, "4328": 6, "6536": 7, "7108": 3, "7135": 9, "8430": 1, "9841": 2}}, "created": "2020-03-07T19:26:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m taking EECS 16B and CS 61B right now, but most of my time goes to the latter.
