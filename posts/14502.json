The only thing OP mentioned about their particular interests that I can see is &#34;I am really bad at memorization so I don&#39;t think I can do Biology&#34;. I&#39;m not sure how many EE classes you&#39;ve taken, but topics covered in 137A come up in integrated circuits (Fourier analysis, quantum tunneling -- basically anything that would be relevant to device physics as well), signal processing (time-frequency uncertainty, Fourier analysis), optoelectronics (probably everything), power electronics and systems (Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier decomposition and Fourier series), etc. And, in case it wasn&#39;t clear from my parenthetical comments, Fourier analysis is pretty important to all of EE as it&#39;s traditionally been defined, and the fact that it&#39;s covered at any level at all in 137A means that the class will naturally have a lot of parallels with EE courses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sure, it&#39;s not likely to be useful for someone who wants to become a software engineer, but, to be frank, most non-coding classes are not likely to be directly useful for software engineering anyway.

My suggestion was also influenced by the courses OP mentioned in the post, which are relatively closely related to 137A. Of course, the other option is to take courses that are meant to be &#34;introductory computing for physical science majors&#34;, which could be very easy as well but this kind of misses the point of this requirement, as you noted.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-03-05T06:22:10Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-03-04T19:25:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "klv9e8hbxst2uj", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I took Astro 7A for this requirement and am enrolled in Physics 137A right now. I haven&#39;t taken Physics 7C. My favorite part about both of these classes (Astro 7A and Physics 137A) is that they don&#39;t have a lab component. Assuming you&#39;ve taken Physics 7B and Math 53, I think they&#39;re both equally approachable, although 137A has linear algebra, probability, and some Fourier analysis which has made it functionally quite a bit easier for me, since I&#39;ve taken EE 120 and 16AB and CS 70 and Math 54.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I learned a bunch of things in Astro 7A which I found very interesting (e.g. lots on blackbody radiation, Kepler&#39;s laws, star birth and death), but have never found the topics particularly applicable to anything I&#39;ve done afterward (in EECS at least). The key to succeeding in Astro 7A (and really most physics classes) is the ability to take word problems and translate them into integrals (or, sometimes, derivatives).

The professor teaching it this semester is Daniel Kasen, and he&#39;s fantastic, in case you get the same chance. But, college is about expanding your horizons, and Astro 7A is a really cool course, so you should consider it as well. When I took it, the whole class (except for me -- I opted out) took a field trip to the Lick Observatory and learned about real astronomy research (the class is designed to get Astro majors excited about Astro and/or immediately weed them out in the first two weeks). Lots of Astro majors in that course seemed to like Astro 7B more, which apparently doesn&#39;t need to be taken after Astro 7A, so you can look into that as well.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpbl6kvl2aq", "name": "Rohin Tangirala", "photo": "1600201004_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnpbl6kvl2aq/1600201004_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnpbl6kvl2aq"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-03-04T19:25:43Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "seen": {"14027": 2, "2004": 3, "2010": 0, "5769": 4, "5770": 5, "5952": 7, "6339": 8, "6513": 1, "7141": 6, "9808": 9}}, "created": "2021-03-01T06:10:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What is the easiest science elective for EECS (the requirement that is usually fulfilled by AP test).
