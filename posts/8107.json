So you may find 186 &#43; 168 a chill combo, especially if you finish 186 projects fast(go to Office Hours early, the later you go, the more people will show up).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, 61c has, on many occasions, taking a lot of my time and attention, making it difficult to keep on track with 186 and 168.

Also I don&#39;t think 127 is necessary pre-req for 189 (but 126 is) , and can be taken jointly since the linear algebra review in first half of 127 &amp; 189 will work nicely for both courses. While 182 doesn&#39;t really require extensive 189 background, I don&#39;t think it makes sense to take deep learning course before even knowing what machine learning is (the grading is also harsh for 182).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d go for</p>\n<p>Sp19: 126 61C 186\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fa19: 127 189 168/161</p>\n<p>Sp20: 162 182 [grad course like 267]</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-10-28T21:25:04Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-28T10:21:46Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hey guys,\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am a junior EECS student who has currently taken 61AB, Physics 7AB, EE16AB, Math 53/54, Data 8/100, CS170 and CS188 amongst relevant technical coursework.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am interested in the following courses: 61C, 126, 127, 189, 162, 186, 168, 182</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I feel like there is not enough time to fill it all without making the semesters\u00a0very hard.
