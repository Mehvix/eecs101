And since I\u2019m a transfer, I\u2019m quite behind compared to other seniors \u2014 I\u2019m really only just finishing up my lower division prerequisites this semester while taking a few upper CS courses/tech electives at the same time. I initially planned to just take three 160s series courses this Spring and finish up the major in the summer with 169, but with the course offerings this semester, it looks like I\u2019ll have to extend my graduation by a year, which would probably hurt my financial aid too.<div><br /></div><div>I\u2019m interested in systems and basically the 16x series courses, and I wanted to take them before I graduate. \u00a0However, in my last semester at Berkeley (next semester), none of the classes that I planned to take for my upper division courses are being offered (these being 160, 168, 169, and 161). Because of this, I am looking for alternative schedules that I can take just so that I can still graduate in time even if I\u2019m not taking the classes that I want to take.</div><div><br /></div><div>So my question is: should I just try to petition to stay one more year to hope that these classes are being offered again? Or should I just take other CS classes and hope to graduate? I don\u2019t want to stay one more year for these classes to not be offered again, while making myself go into more debt, but at the same time, I do want to take these classes before graduation.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>TL;DR: I\u2019m really just looking for advice for what I should do now that none of the 160s classes that I wanted to take are being offered. I know this is a really hard question to answer, so I welcome any and all feedback.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks!</div>", "created": "2020-10-10T19:54:21Z", "subject": "160s series classes not offered", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kg43kjpexl91jr", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13287, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542393113, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1596323170_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1596323170_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3lfep2k3k8", "name": "Isabella de Leon", "photo": "1570251565_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6nu3lfep2k3k8/1570251565_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jwslfmrdirb540": 1563401585, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1576411252, "k509eg2kx302ol": 1588914914}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "name": "Parth Gupta", "photo": "1567400054_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwu0ujo2fbl4tc/1567400054_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhwn369f6ik", "name": "Kevin Zhu", "photo": "1578594899_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhwn369f6ik/1578594899_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrx0may4y39v", "name": "Tammy Truong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "karb2cc8qln6sy", "name": "Faywer Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhcjpozd5xg", "j6nu3lfep2k3k8", "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "jktvhwn369f6ik", "j6lrx0may4y39v", "karb2cc8qln6sy"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "enrollments", "lscs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 280}
