I also did academic interning for two classes during that summer as well - so if you have something significant you&#39;d like to work on along with CS70, it&#39;s doable and I&#39;d definitely recommend this option.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Personally, even my first internship interview focused on my side projects (I had a few) - so if you&#39;re scared of not having\u00a0<em>any\u00a0</em>experience for your next internship, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be that big of an issue if you&#39;ve got other things you&#39;re working on during the summer. In terms of what I see in the job description for your internship offer, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the most technical experience - strong research and/or side projects that are presentable, in my opinion, could make the same difference in terms of recruiting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck with your decision!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "idril5ilwbx4bj", "updated": "2018-05-14T06:18:55Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 5/13 - 5/19", "bucket_order": 98, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 5/13 - 5/19", "bucket_order": 98, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-15T01:04:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jh6z55e7i6l1", "subject": "<p>I did 61A and 61B (did one unit for each).
