The proofs also are worst-case complexity proofs (and also force you to read up on the PCP theorem which takes up a long time, but maybe worthwhile), so they don&#39;t give much intuition about what sets of games are actually hard.\u00a0<br /><br />The best way to visualize which class of games are hard in a structured setting is this:\u00a0<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2405\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2405</a>. It uses fancy algebraic topology terms, but roughly it says that normal form games are just discretized curves, and when you look at differences (which corresponds to players changing actions), this is like looking at flows on curves. Flows are usually a sum of basic cyclic flows and gradient flows of a potential function, and the parts that make finding equilibria hard in a game are the cyclic flows that make it hard to converge.\u00a0<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Deepmind applied these concepts to GANs and got ICML 2018 runner up:\u00a0https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05642</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-08-27T07:21:57Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/26 - 9/1", "bucket_order": 87, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-08-27T07:41:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jlbz4pjpjo821k", "subject": "<p>For the intuition behind these papers, should I be looking at grad courses (such as <a href=\"http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~satishr/cs270/sp17/\" target=\"_blank\">CS270</a>) or is it self-studyable for someone who has taken 170 (we slightly went over zero-sum games and multiplicative update weights method)?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-08-27T07:41:21Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-08-27T06:17:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jlbw4p4ahl2jy", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Hi which specific part of AGT are you into?
