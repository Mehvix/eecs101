It is slightly unlikely to get in 162 given that most people enroll in groups. However, If I had\u00a0the luxury to\u00a0pick among the two, I would go with 162. 162 is a class where you learn by\u00a0coding and discussing ideas with your group whereas 189 is mostly mathematical and theoretical. I also think that having a group to devise up plans and achieve those goals together is much more meaningful than grinding through the math alone in your last semester here. With the hype of ML, there are just so many free resources to learn ML online and they are becoming more and more accessible. You can simply self learn the materials in 189 if you are interested. I hope this helps.</p>", "created": "2019-05-05T23:01:13Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "jvbjihpamv16s1", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewnh0nkz2vd", "name": "Stephen Costello", "photo": "1536024428_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6lewnh0nkz2vd/1536024428_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jjd5ukm1ddp6x6": 1539310233}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5ubio21xll1qz", "name": "Kate Sanders", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6v3ubkv5p6", "name": "Alex Yeo", "photo": "1551120700_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p6v3ubkv5p6/1551120700_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6lewnh0nkz2vd", "j5ubio21xll1qz", "is6p6v3ubkv5p6", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-05T21:46:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So next semester is my last semester, and I have to decide between taking CS189 and CS162.
