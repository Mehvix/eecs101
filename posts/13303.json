This will happen less often for SP21 because campus policy has shifted. It used to be that instructors were NOT responsible for creating alternative exams for students with conflicts. Students were required to ask and make sure it would work. For SP21 (I&#39;m not clear if this is a permanent or only COVID-related change), faculty who allow time conflicts will be required to offer alternative exam times to students in classes that have lecture conflicts. Since using the same exam creates cheating risks and creating a different exam may take ~100 hours of course staff time, more instructors will refuse to allow time conflicts.</p>", "created": "2020-10-12T15:18:03Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i1i1qn178di2vn"}], "id": "kg6okxczdaf1b9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11289": 7, "11911": 9, "12068": 0, "12151": 2, "12772": 1, "13153": 6, "13157": 4, "5099": 5, "6722": 3, "8745": 8}}, "created": "2020-10-11T23:06:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>If both CS170 and EECS16A lectures are TU/TH at 9:30am-11am, even with online recordings, are we not able to take these classes together next semester?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-10-11T23:06:10Z", "subject": "Spring 2021 CS170 &amp; EECS16A", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kg5pv2o1vmu6jx", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13303, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542375145, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 223}
