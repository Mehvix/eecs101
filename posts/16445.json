There were some similar base topics, but overall they taught different technologies. They revamped their curriculum this semester, however, and now their content is very similar to ours. I can\u2019t speak to Cubstart, but we\u2019ve been teaching this curriculum for 4 semesters (2 as an internal education program, 2 as a DeCal now), so our material is very fleshed out and tested, whereas this is Cubstart\u2019s first semester teaching this content.<br /><br /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">We&#39;ve also expanded to a greater degree than Cubstart has in the last year - Cubstart has 75 seats open in the academic guide, whereas we plan on taking 110-120 students total. This is also an assumption, but given that we have 2 lectures per week vs their lab and lecture every week, we may cover more material. Without seeing their lesson plans, however (ours our public, but there\u2019s haven\u2019t been released on their site yet), I cannot say anything for sure. We do plan to talk to them, however, to see if there&#39;s any way to collaborate for the good of the Berkeley community! Overall, however, Cubstart is still a great opportunity, and any initiative to teach the joys of development is a great one in my eyes.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyauasdx7jb4gc", "name": "Samarth Goel", "photo": "1611024210_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jyauasdx7jb4gc/1611024210_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyhhvicp4uo510", "name": "Victoria Li", "photo": "1634157043_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jyhhvicp4uo510/1634157043_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kc9wfmpkl4m1eq": 1601176336}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgglvqqi51v", "name": "Alex Wu", "photo": "1629957069_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvgglvqqi51v/1629957069_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jyauasdx7jb4gc", "jyhhvicp4uo510", "jktvgglvqqi51v"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jyauasdx7jb4gc", "updated": "2022-01-21T18:56:05Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2022-01-21T08:32:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kyo5a90um1v4ga", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "How is this different from the Cubstart web dev decal?", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2022-01-21T08:32:25Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/16 - 1/22", "bucket_order": 9, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/16 - 1/22", "bucket_order": 9, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2022-01-22T06:31:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kypgevlqzha1jr", "subject": "<p>The course is 3 units and covers a lot of material and has a good amount of assignments, so I&#39;d say expect to put it 6-8 hours per week as you would any other 3 unit class.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jyauasdx7jb4gc", "updated": "2022-01-22T06:31:43Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2022-01-21T20:02:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kyotxayk9s5228", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>How hefty is the workload of this class?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2022-01-21T20:02:12Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/16 - 1/22", "bucket_order": 9, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/16 - 1/22", "bucket_order": 9, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2022-01-22T06:34:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kypgiyd7uro2f8", "subject": "<p>Unfortunately, there is no boost for previous applicants.
