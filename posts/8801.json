Following that, 16B was redesigned this semester to go even lower level than the transistors and circuitry to the atomic/molecular level of what current actually is in terms of the electrons flowing around PMOS&#39;s and NMOS&#39;s so I found it amazingly neat to see python\u00a0code from 61A become more efficient through 61B, and code compiling from 61B get translated to 1s and 0s, which are then &#34;represented&#34; with voltages in circuits and electrons flowing through transistors. Additionally, taking Math 53 has minimal overlap with EE16B since 16B uses imaginary\u00a0numbers which\u00a0is the same as having a third dimension, along with having differential equations.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&#39;s just what I&#39;ve taken so far, but it really excites me for the upper division classes specifically in OS&#39;s, ML, Computer Security, and efficient algorithms.
