To me, the difference seemed to be in that Shewhcuk would focus a great deal more on the concepts than the rigorous math (which Sahai focused on a lot). Both, in my opinion, have their benefits, but Sahai&#39;s in my opinion is the way to go forward. It&#39;s not that Shewchuk&#39;s iteration didn&#39;t have rigorous math, but Sahai&#39;s iteration did really show how important the mathematical details and rigorousness are to understand where the approaches we talk about come from.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would not say that Sahai&#39;s iteration &#34;assumes 126/127&#34;. It moreso assumes EE16A/B, CS70, foundations in linear algebra, probability, optimization, and multvariable calculus, mathematical maturity in general, proper study habits, and a drive to deeply understand the material. EE126/7 are certainly very helpful for some of this, and they CERTAINLY will let you make the most out of your experience with CS189, but I would not say they are assumed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The way Sahai describes it is that students should have already have passed through these foundations in some form in previous classes. CS189 should probably be your 3rd pass in linear algebra, 3rd pass in probability, (maybe) ~2nd pass in optimization, and 2nd pass in multivariable calculus. That way, you really maintain this rigorousness and understand a lot of the important details in order to truly appreciate the material.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hzd1l1ikja12ki", "updated": "2017-12-21T04:42:26Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/17 - 12/23", "bucket_order": 118, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-23T14:16:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jbjfh1hezh5765", "subject": "<p>I will be taking 110 with Frenkel.
