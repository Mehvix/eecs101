Upon hindsight, I took Shewchuk&#39;s 189 with only ee16ab/cs70/math53 and those classes were more than enough preparation, especially with the recent changes to 16ab. My courseload that semester was CS189 &#43; CS162 &#43; another CS upper div, which is essentially what OP is trying to do.\u00a0It was a reasonably challenging semester, but I received A in all three classes\u00a0<em><strong>with CS189 being the easiest of the three</strong>.</em>\u00a0Again, this is purely my personal experience/background and of course YMMV based on your own educational background/strengths/weaknesses.
