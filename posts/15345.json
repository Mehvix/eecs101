Theoretically adding on 61C is as well, but 61C is very high workload as far as I know so it may come down to how much you need to do of it. That being said, I have definitely taken schedules that are comparable to doing all three together and it is very possible, but it will be a negligible amount of work. My best advice would be to start problem sets and projects literally the day they are assigned if you are able, as that helps you stay on top of things.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kokj0h76u431lp", "name": "Nigel Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kokj0h76u431lp"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jwu0uamspzf4l0", "updated": "2021-07-14T20:02:14Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"12673": 0, "12772": 9, "13263": 6, "3810": 7, "4305": 2, "5201": 5, "6947": 1, "7792": 3, "7802": 8, "8203": 4}}, "created": "2021-07-14T19:49:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "lscs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m looking to declare this fall semester and clear 61C this semester so I can take the systems upper div courses next semester.
