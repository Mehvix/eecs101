I found the class to be a little unfulfilling. It feels like a really surface level survey of security concepts. I did enjoy the cryptography section. Tests and homework were on the easier side, however the projects took me much more time than I expected. They also weren&#39;t very fulfilling projects. I didn&#39;t feel the projects taught me much They aren&#39;t as large as projects in design classes but I would not underestimate the time they will take. \u00a0<br /><br />The difficulty of 189 will very based off of your familiarity with linear algebra, probability, and to a lesser degree calculus. I would look at notes from previous classes, if the math feels comfortable that in my experience is a good indication of how the class will feel. I took 189 with Shewchuk and I loved the class. In all, I would say I spent less time on 189 than 161 and I did the same in both of them grade wise. I attribute the time disparity to the time drain of projects in 161.\u00a0<br /><br />I haven&#39;t taken EE127 but I believe if you are familiar with linear algebra and calculus the optimization you need to know for 189 will not be prohibitively difficult to learn and you won&#39;t need to take 127 before taking 189. This was my personal experience but others may have other advice.\u00a0<br /><br />If I were you, and I were to cut a class it would be 161, but that largely is because I am not a fan of project classes. Of all of the classes I took at Cal, I would say 161 was among the least useful as well, but that largely is a function of the field I have decided to go into.\u00a0<br /><br />I hope that helps, good luck with your decision.</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-04-02T18:52:38Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/8 - 4/14", "bucket_order": 102, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-10T06:01:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jft9cfm8jx87og", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>First 3rd of 127 is linear algebra topics so it might be less useful to take it concurrently because you start learning about optimization after 1/3 of the semester has already passed</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-04-10T06:01:08Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-02T15:32:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "faculty_advising", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I have read posts from Prof Sahai that EECS 126, 127 are good preparation courses for CS 189.
