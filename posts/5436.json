However, today I got an email saying there was a problem and that the 999 section was removed meaning I need to drop and re-enroll. I am currently on the waitlist at position 132. If I drop and re-enroll I will be placed on the waitlist at position ~290. This significantly reduces my chances of getting into the class. What steps should I take to ensure that I don&#39;t lose my spot on the waitlist? Dropping and re-enrolling will place me at the end of the waitlist even if the section is open. I really want to take this class next semester so any advice accepted.
