There were about 5 projects, each of which took me about maybe 20 hours to complete. For 288, I found a linear algebra background to be less important than just experience coding neural nets. I&#39;ve also taken CS 189, and although it should be lighter in a non-Sahai semester, I would still expect it to take a huge chunk of time since the material is pretty tough even with a good background. I&#39;ve heard CS 182 is lighter than the other two, but still requires some time commitment, so I would be cautious taking it with two heavier classes. Honestly if you feel ready enough to take CS 288 and have the research experience to back it up, I think CS 182 can wait. I know people who took Info 159, and I it teaches the most unique material compared to CS 182 and CS 288, so if I were you I would switch out one of those for 159.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2021-01-01T20:20:08Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kjeq1egdkek6ey", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgoe0t1k57a", "name": "Kristy Lee", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvgoe0t1k57a"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-05T07:25:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjjo4ea6vr611y", "subject": "<p>I do research in NLP</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-01-05T07:25:19Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-02T01:47:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjf1qgm0n4k7f5", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Hi Op, are you an undergraduate student?</p>\n<p>I&#39;m interested in enrolling in CS288 as well.</p>\n<p>How were you able to enroll?</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwl34q25aj15r7", "name": "Ethan Guo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfb9m79q49m", "name": "Violet Yao", "photo": "1597777605_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvfb9m79q49m/1597777605_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwl34q25aj15r7", "jktvfb9m79q49m"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-01-02T01:47:33Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-02T08:14:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjffk3x1qgz1rn", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>How useful was 288?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2021-01-02T08:14:31Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-05T04:49:45Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjjikc61xsfx8", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What is CS182 like compared to the difficulty of other classes?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2021-01-05T04:49:45Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11711": 1, "12068": 8, "12127": 9, "12436": 0, "13360": 3, "13480": 2, "6245": 6, "9052": 7, "9434": 5, "9766": 4}}, "created": "2020-12-31T20:28:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m thinking of taking CS189, CS182, and CS288 (I have the option to enroll), but I was wondering about the workload objectively if I have a good linear algebra background and plan to self study PyTorch over break/have some research background, because I&#39;m starting to get afraid that it will be too heavy and online learning hasn&#39;t been that great for me (have been pretty low energy).
