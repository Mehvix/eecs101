But for your first side project, it&#39;s kind of overwhelming to deal with all the info out on the web so I would recommend finding a tutorial (and sticking to it) first for whatever stack you decide to work with (i.e Flask, Django, Rails, etc). Just choose one - it doesn&#39;t matter very much, since you can pick up more very quickly later. Finish the tutorial, then use what you learned to build something you actually want to do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think it&#39;s quite hard to force yourself to do side projects unless you&#39;re really passionate about tech/coding (even though I have lots of ideas I often prefer listening to music or watching shows LOL), so if you can find a friend to work together that might be more fun! Something else I personally did was online courses (Udemy, etc).
