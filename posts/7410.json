ALL of the following courses are pre-reqs for CS 189:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Math 53</p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Math 54 (for which we will continue to accept EE 16 A or B as equivalent)</p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CS 70</p>\n</li></ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How we decided whom to potentially move to the waitlist</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"https://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/enrollment\">Registrar\u2019s office</a>, students can be unenrolled (dropped) from a class if they do not meet the course prerequisites. Accordingly, we are bound to consider who has or has not completed all prerequisites for CS 189. In an effort to limit impact on students, we have opted to unenroll/move students to the top of the waitlist rather than completely drop them from the class.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the spirit of transparency, we wanted to share with you the criteria that was used to determine whom to unenroll from the class back to the top of the waitlist for CS 189. </p>\n<ol><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We identified people who had NOT fulfilled all the <a href=\"http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/\">stated prerequisites</a> for this course.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From this pool of students, all non-seniors will be moved to the top of the waitlist in the same order in which they enrolled (someone who enrolled on April 16th will have a better position on the waitlist than someone who enrolled on April 30th).<br /><br /></p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Within the pool of people who have not met all prerequisites, and to the extent that seniors have to be moved, we will go by enrollment date \u2013 most recently enrolled will be the first moved to the waitlist. As with others, if you enrolled on 4/16, you will appear higher on the waitlist than someone who enrolled on 4/30.</p>\n</li><li><ul><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EXCEPTION: We will skip any senior in semester 8 because they won\u2019t have another chance to take the class.</p>\n</li></ul>\n</li></ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We recognize this situation causes many students stress and we DEEPLY regret that we cannot accommodate all enrolled students into the course as planned. EECS classes, and classroom space on campus, are both highly impacted. The result is that we attempt to find creative ways to accommodate more students and it doesn&#39;t always work out. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As this post hopefully demonstrates, staff and advisers take this situation seriously and are doing all that we can to mitigate the impact to students. Our hope is that through attrition, we will actually have to unenroll far fewer than 90 students from CS189.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Currently Waitlisted Students</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please check back for more information. Our first priority was to take care of students who were already enrolled to give them time to make alternate plans before the adjustment period begins. I anticipate having more information about how to handle the existing waitlisted students late Friday or Saturday. (8/10 or 8/11)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-08-10T03:51:30Z", "subject": "F18: CS 189 NOT being webcast, class is over-enrolled", "uid": "j0b75czu7362rq"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jkngfn6xk1s5ee", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7410, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548859831, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 1477}
