Each class is 3 hrs long and will be about going through one or two of the recent important/interest papers in detail. The exact selection of papers has not been decided yet\u00a0but it will be based on topics related to secure computation (with an emphasis\u00a0on garbling techniques), fully-homomorphic\u00a0encryption and obfuscation. The goal is to help grad students more aware of the important open problems (especially ones which might be within reach).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Prereqs: There are no specific prereqs except for some prior familiarity with cryptography (or you can try catching that up on your own; this may take a fair bit of your time). Otherwise, you\u00a0may not benefit much from this class. However, if you are hoping for a first graduate-level crypto class then I would suggest CS276.
