Stat likes analysis so while 185 would help, it would be better to take MATH 105 or 202A.

I would say: Calculus (1AB,53), Linear Algebra (54), Discrete Math (55), Probability (134), Statistics (135), Linear Modeling (151A), Optimization (127), Machine Learning (189), Stochastic Processes (150), Time Series (153), Data Structures and Algorithms(61AB,170) would be the core ones.
