With this comes the opportunity to leverage such data to grow our understanding of biology and make discoveries that could have great impact on human health. Currently however, the tools to analyze such data are primitive, and in some cases, nonexistent. The Big Data Genomics group within AMPLab is focused on applying large-scale computing techniques and technology to the analysis of genetic data and creating the next generation of tools for large-scale genomic data analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Preferred Quals:<br />-Experience programming in Scala and/or Spark, as well as any experience working with tools such as Apache Maven, Apache Parquet, and Docker are highly desired.\u00a0<br />-Experience working with of distributed file systems and an understanding of general principles involved in distributed computing are encouraged.\u00a0<br />-Knowledge in genomic data analysis or related topics such as the Genome Wide Association Study technique and any experience working with genomic data formats are also encouraged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A minimum commitment of 2 semesters is required.
