I am planning on getting a CS MS starting Fall 2021, and I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me some advice on my decision!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have been accepted to the CS MS programs at Columbia, Brown, UCLA, UT Austin, UIUC, UC Irvine, and the University of Michigan (I&#39;m still waiting on a few more schools, i.e., Berkeley 5th Year EECS MS, Cornell, and Georgia Tech). The universities I am currently mainly considering, of the ones I have already been admitted to, are Columbia, UCLA, UT Austin, UIUC and UC Irvine. I&#39;m having trouble finding concrete advantages/disadvantages that some of these schools have in relation to each other so that I can have tangible reasons for filtering some of the schools out and coming to a decision. I was wondering if anyone might have any insights/opinions, from personal experiences or from friends, about any of these schools and/or their CS programs, specifically graduate programs but undergraduate information also could be helpful) that you would be willing to share. Columbia, UT Austin, and UIUC, and UC Irvine have coursework only options (without research), and separate research options, and at UCLA you do a research thesis/project. Cost is definitely one factor (Columbia comes out to be around $57,000 more expensive than UT Austin and UIUC, and about $45,000 more than UCLA, and UC Irvine would turn out to essentially be free because of a scholarship offer), but I don&#39;t want to base my decision solely, or extremely heavily on cost, as Columbia has some advantages the other schools do not (located in NYC, near Wall Street, as I am potentially interested in, but definitely not certain about, going into the fintech/financial industry after getting my Master&#39;s degree).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Any input, no matter how small, would be sincerely appreciated!
