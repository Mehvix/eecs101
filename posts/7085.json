I think something like Data 100 (or 189 :^) ) might help more depending on what you&#39;re looking for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hey, I took UGBA 104 last Fall and I would say that it is far easier than a typical CS upper div class. (I&#39;m doubling in EECS &amp; Haas) There&#39;s no homework, one lecture a week, mandatory lab, and super-low workload, but also optional sections on Friday in case you want practice. The profs are the same this upcoming Fall and it&#39;s probably fine if you don&#39;t fall too far behind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I took 189 at the same time and 104 was like a different side of ML where everything is black-boxed... I&#39;d say the focus of the class is on the operations side of business.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although the first half focuses on higher-level applications of machine learning techniques, the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">midterm was quite hard</span> because it focused more on what technique you should apply in what scenario. I have not taken Data 100, but 104 is probably less rigorous and more creative/business application-focused. You get a fast-paced intro to decision trees, k-means, a bit of regression, etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The second half is mainly about linear programming and I felt it was far more straightforward, especially after LPs in CS 170.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The class has something like 15% for labs (discussion section Excel assignments) and 85% on 1 midterm and a non-cumulative final where the one you do better on gets more weight. The final was not bad (at all), but heavy weight on exams with possibly vague and tricky questions (on the midterm) can add difficulty (sort of like 188?).
