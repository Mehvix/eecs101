I think EE 120 and EE 130 represent the two sides of the EE coin much much better than 16A and B do so you&#39;re not missing much.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE 120: This is mostly a mathematical methods class. Useful for general engineering because it turns out a lot of physical systems can be modeled using linearity and time-shifting. The most important prereqs for this would be Math 1B, Math 54, and Physics 7B. Math 1B because the class deals a lot with improper integration and some odd integral techniques, Math 54 because a study of linear systems uses concepts from linear algebra like orthogonality and inner products, and 7B because the examples that the classes use are often rooted in E&amp;M due to it being an EE class. You don&#39;t want your first time hearing about an RLC circuit transient response to be this class, but 7A and B should be enough of a physics primer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE 130: This class is an applied physics class. You definitely need Physics 7B for this class, since the class deals with how electrons flow through solid-state devices. The class is mostly a primer on solid-state physics followed by derivations of current models through different electron device geometries. No math necessary beyond that needed for 7B. However, you might be missing some context without EE 105. You&#39;ll be able to work out the current characteristics of a biased MOSFET, but if you don&#39;t really know what a MOSFET is used for, it&#39;ll seem pointless and arbitrary. The models you derive in this class are the ones used in EE 105, but in EE 105 you actually discuss how to build amplifiers. EE 130 will make you really prepared for EE 105, but EE 105 is definitely doable without EE 130.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a note, if you&#39;re not planning on taking 16AB, 120 might be necessary before 105 (but not for 130). The reason is that 105 starts off by introducing how closed-loop circuits affect amplifier gain. Simple amplifier circuits are discussed in 16 and will not be reviewed in 105, but the abstract treatment of feedback loops covered in EE 120 coupled with a physics intuition should be more than enough to make up for it.</p>", "created": "2020-11-18T03:29:57Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6h4hugwlvg6cg"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "khmuktcdwxb4mi", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k5k3ew56dgi5t3", "name": "Rowan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpbl6kvl2aq", "name": "Rohin Tangirala", "photo": "1600201004_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jzlnpbl6kvl2aq/1600201004_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["k5k3ew56dgi5t3", "jzlnpbl6kvl2aq"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-18T05:40:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "khmz99deh5w7dz", "subject": "<p>I think it depends on what you&#39;re studying. 105 is an application of 130, but far from the only application of it.
