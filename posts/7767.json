You would need to be comfortable with phasor analysis, transfer functions (poles, zeroes, etc), and Bode plots, all of which the course assumes right from the get-go. These are all taught in the first part of 16B, but by the time 16B will have gotten to these topics, 105 will have zoomed far past. Furthermore, concepts from 16B&#39;s last module (LTI systems and the DFT) are very relevant to analog circuit design. If you have watched 16B&#39;s webcast this semester and feel extraordinarily comfortable with the material, then you\u00a0<em>might</em> be fine, but I would still strongly recommend taking 16B beforehand.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-10-11T20:27:27Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Assuming you&#39;ve taken 16A, this is definitely possible.
