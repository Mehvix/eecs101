It actually was pretty doable. A lot of times, there would end up being work to do in all 3 at the same exact time, but as long as you start each assignment early you should actually be fine. IMO, 61c was the most time consuming of all (labs and hws every week) but I did take it with Weaver who has more projects than Garcia so that could be it too. 100 took the backseat most of the time which is the only downside since I didn\u2019t end up focusing on it a lot but still ended up doing well (A-). 170 has a consistent workload (weekly hw) so that made it easy to create a routine with the 3 classes since I had a dedicated few times a week to 170 problem sets. They can be heavy though, so of course start those right away!</p>", "created": "2019-08-09T15:02:13Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jz48o9dc4lf1qq", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrx0may4y39v", "name": "Tammy Truong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6lrx0may4y39v"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-09T04:57:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!
