And 55 is so similar to 70 I can&#39;t see them ever booting you from the class for this reason even if it over capacity by week 1. It not unheard of for CS classes to be overfull but it&#39;s also not unheard of for CS classes to try various scare tactics to make sure people aren&#39;t just willy nilly enrolling in the courses without meeting pre-reqs.
