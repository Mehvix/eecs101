Luckily the class hasn&#39;t seemed to finished enrollment and my current waitlist position should be enough to get into the class. I phase 2ed the class and I added myself to, at the time of my phase 2, an available section, but unfortunately was waitlisted due to what looked like the 70% enrollment rule. The problem is now I&#39;m still on the waitlist and it seems the section I enrolled in has filled up completely. I seen the posts where it seems you can&#39;t be added into the class if you are waitlisted for section, and you can&#39;t swap sections if you are on the waitlist. However, at the same time, I fear that there won&#39;t be enough spots if I end up on the end of the waitlist. Is it possible I can email the CS 186 instructor or Calcentral system admin to manually add me in before I get skipped over? Or are these my two options, and if so which would end up having a higher chance of getting me into the class.
