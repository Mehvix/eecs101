There were definitely times that I felt like I didn&#39;t fully understand the theory, but I was still able to apply the concepts in the projects. Overall I really enjoyed the class! I&#39;m a very visual learner, so applying cs to images was fun for me.

Most of the projects are about computational photography and you&#39;ll do linear algebra stuff, similar to 184. The project 4 is more oriented towards computer vision and involves neural nets, and I think it was pretty doable having never worked with them before. So if you&#39;re worried about that part of things, it&#39;s not for the whole class.

I just wanted to know if CS 194 is similar to 184 because I&#39;ve heard that it uses a lot of topics from 184, but just from googling computer vision, it looks like a field that is more oriented towards Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning instead of graphics. Also, for anyone who has taken the class before, I wanted to hear your experiences from it. I&#39;ve read that the class has pre-reqs of programming knowledge (of at least 61b level) and working knowledge of linear algebra. &#34;Experience with neural networks (CS189) is a plus&#34;. How much material from CS182/CS188/CS189 is used? Although it doesn&#39;t state that those classes are necessarily required pre-reqs, I would assume that knowledge and material from those classes would be heavily used in a class like this. I&#39;m in the middle of taking data100 so there&#39;s some machine learning in there. Would I be able to get by without taking cs182/188/189? I&#39;d also like to hear about the computational photography side as well.
