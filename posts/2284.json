Just replace the non-EECS courses appropriately to reflect L&amp;S college breadth requirements. But I will recommend the same lower-division EECS sequence for L&amp;S CS students because that is really the best way to be adequately prepared. At this point, the within-major course\u00a0requirements are essentially harmonized across the two majors offered by the EECS department. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The EECS lower-division and its logic is really simple to understand. There are two 3-course sequences: 61A, 61B, 61C and 16A, 16B, 70. Each of these sequences ramps up difficulty and nurtures\u00a0students so that they are ready for the next course. \u00a0At the last step, the two trilogies interweave somewhat with 61B being gently helpful for 70 as compared to 16B which is directly helpful in terms of core skills. Meanwhile, 16B is gently helpful for 61C while 61B is directly helpful.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These sample plans are really most helpful in understanding the sequencing of lower-division\u00a0courses. The deeper\u00a0logic behind the upper-division is not represented here because at that point, there are many choices and tracks based on your interests across the modeling/math/algorithms, software development, and hardware development pathways. All that can be said confidently about the upper-division is that essentially everyone should take 170.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2016-10-16T23:28:56Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-15T20:01:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "iubmp38q56z577", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Are there similar plans available to CS/intended CS students?
