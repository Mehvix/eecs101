CS61A is just the first barrier you need to overcome if you want to earn a CS degree, there is really no prerequisite before CS61A. The only thing to care about is that the workload for the combination of these two classes would be extremely high. You&#39;d be expected to read Notes before going to CS70 lecture, and it usually would improve your understanding in lecture compared to not reading them beforehand. For CS61A, there are so many resources to utilize on website, and the thing is just to handle them most efficiently. Start looking over past midterms at least one week before midterm. (some people I know even start doing this 2 weeks beforehand)\u00a0</p>\n<p>After all this, you probably don&#39;t want to take another technical course or writing-intensive course, that would be my suggestion if you want to excel simultaneously in these two courses.
