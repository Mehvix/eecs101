The only difference between the classes was discussion sections/labs.  As far as I know, the GSIs for 141 and 150 did basically the same things in section.  The main difference between the two classes was the lab sections/projects.  \n\nThose of us in 150 did our labs/project on FPGAs, while 141 did theirs in ASICs.  Both projects involved designing a pipelined RISC-V CPU, but the 141 project did seem easier than the 150 project, at least based on the few conversations I overheard.  For example, the 150 project required that we implement a line-drawing engine, which quite a few groups never got around to completing because of setbacks in earlier parts of the project.  Students in 141 weren&#39;t struggling with the project as much as 150 students based off of what I heard from my peers.  \n\nThe project is really what made 150 an &#34;8&#34; unit course.  A large majority of students in 150 would be in the lab until 2 or 3 in the morning every day for the month or so that we were working on the project.  With respect to workload from other classes, I personally took two other technical classes (albeit one was a 3 unit grad class that was relatively easy) and a nontechnical class when I was taking 150.  It was manageable, but if I were to do it again I probably would try to take 150 in a semester when I had a lighter course load.  Again, my comparison between the two classes and my experience is just that -- my personal experience.", "created": "2015-04-06T00:22:48Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "i854wa8khpv7lw", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktwxnx25af478", "name": "Alexandre Chong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100002770657891", "id": "hktxrk2tkas3go", "name": "Jeff Wettstein", "photo": "1432217667_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktxrk2tkas3go/1432217667_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz29sw7xgqu2n5", "name": "Ka Yiu Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lggffoe2x7", "name": "Edward Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hktwxnx25af478", "hktxrk2tkas3go", "hz29sw7xgqu2n5", "hzd1lggffoe2x7"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-04-05T21:07:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>I was contemplating on taking either one of these courses for next semester. \u00a0Possibly with EE128 and EE137A.</p>\n<p>I heard that they share the same lectures, however what are their differences logistic wise? \u00a0Would it be wise to\u00a0</p>\n<p>take two other techs with either one of these courses?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>", "created": "2015-04-05T21:07:52Z", "subject": "EE141 Vs CS150", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "i84xxm44k3r105", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 182, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654556598888, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz29sw7xgqu2n5", "name": "Ka Yiu Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hz29sw7xgqu2n5"], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 267}
