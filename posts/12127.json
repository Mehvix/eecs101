As someone who hopes to get involved in ML research next semester, I intend to self-study some of the topics over the summer. However, I am conflicted over which ones to choose to best allocate my time. I will be taking CS 189 next semester but since I hope to get involved in research at the same time, I plan to self-learn the contents of the class over the summer. However, one of my TAs from EECS 126 mentioned that Stanford&#39;s CS 231n is also a great course to self-learn before starting research. Hence, I wanted to get your opinion: would you recommend self-studying CS 189 (or the Stanford equivalent CS 229) or CS 231n this summer, considering that I have taken EECS 126 so far only. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I will be able to do both since I wish to apply the material I will be learning to reimplement a research paper or two that I find interesting in the field (alongside my internship).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks for your advice!</p>", "created": "2020-05-03T01:06:02Z", "subject": "Best course to self-study over the summer?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "k9qct80yjk14xf", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12127, "num_favorites": 10, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654543675774, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7c2ca2q62f", "name": "Jacob Martinez", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k5k3fsp6g1u6lv", "name": "Dayne Tran", "photo": "1595720343_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/k5k3fsp6g1u6lv/1595720343_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1587140172, "jc559y99w0i4jj": 1518125938}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jbibjmz0u461pv", "name": "Japjot Singh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p7c2ca2q62f", "k5k3fsp6g1u6lv", "jbibjmz0u461pv"], "tags": ["faculty_advising", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 595}
