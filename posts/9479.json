I am trying to enroll in 53 in case I don&#39;t get off the waitlist. Basically I am trying to make it so that I enroll with 53 and have a swap with 188 so if I get off the waitlist for 188 I drop 53, that way I can be in the unit cap but be set up for both courses. The swap system does not allow me to swap 188, since it is waitlisted. Is there any way to do this without dropping 188 and losing my waitlist spot? Thank you!</p>", "created": "2019-05-01T18:42:32Z", "subject": "Swap Waitlisted Class with Other class, but remain on waitlist?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jv5kiep03pq7ki", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9479, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546661685, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 239}
