I&#39;ll offer my thoughts on the subject, here, and other students/advisers can add on below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As other students have noted, an NP on your transcript is not very attractive to both graduate admissions, nor the major admissions. Additionally, it may be worth mentioning that there is a very tiny chance you might still pass the course, depending on the professor(s), so technically that would be a gamble, as well. If you are planning on graduate studies in <em>any</em> field, or some related academic goal, then keep in mind that an NP is like an F. It does not factor into your GPA, but some transcript reviewers might factor it in that way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, I recommend you study <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hard</span> harder for your final. Redo practice problems and homework problems, do past exams, and don&#39;t forget about other resources out there, as well. If you are in a CSM section, ask your mentor any questions. If not, CSM worksheets and review materials are still available to all students, even if they are not enrolled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, I offer the reminder that you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to major in CS if it really comes down to it. There many other options, including the CS minor, CogSci, and other majors, as well, with the CS flavor. On the off chance that declaring CS doesn&#39;t end up happening, there are other paths. You don&#39;t need to be a CS major to do amazing CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That being said, good luck!</p>", "created": "2016-04-01T16:49:28Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "imhy3nzosem6sy", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "id1upwyo2qi27g", "name": "Aneesh Khera", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2018_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2017_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "classof2016_hyq0br1u3kx7dg", "transfers_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icdxydvnk125h8", "name": "Nicole Evans McIntyre", "photo": "1441300389_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/icdxydvnk125h8/1441300389_35.png", "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hkn0ly0zyk11bk", "name": "Yuan Yuan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["id1upwyo2qi27g", "icdxydvnk125h8", "hkn0ly0zyk11bk", "iscem14kbsu5vi"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 3/27 - 4/2", "bucket_order": 215, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-04-01T17:05:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "imhynyngjnx267", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thank you very much.
