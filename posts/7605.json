Quick note: You&#39;ll always find people complaining about something and\u00a0they assume\u00a0it&#39;s a general issue. For example, weather may be mildly &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;cold&#34;, but some people will think it&#39;s &#34;super hot&#34;, while others are fine. I can wear a T-shirt in Berkeley weather year round, while someone else will need 2 layers of jackets. If someone says &#34;Berkeley weather is freezing&#34;, this isn&#39;t the case for everyone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I use this analogy because it&#39;s the same with housing. Some people say &#34;housing is scarce and expensive&#34; because it is for them. I don&#39;t think housing is too hard to find at Berkeley.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Find 3-4 people and see if you can rent a house/apartment. Ask seniors/juniors/sophomores if you can take their place next year. Go on the 3-4 UC Berkeley housing pages on Facebook. Go to club specific groups and ask your club peers. If you start doing that right now, you&#39;ll be flooded with opportunities for housing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve had a friend paying $500 for a double because they crammed 5 people in a cheap 3 bedroom. I know people paying $800 for a double, and people paying $1200 for a double. I know people who are paying $600 for singles(Co-Ops, apply right now), and $2500 for their own apartment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d say explore the market, educate yourself by asking your peers, and have your pick.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your budget is $500 or something, look into a triple or living room.
