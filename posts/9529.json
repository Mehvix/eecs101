You have to study large files of code and they take time and thought. A bad class to take with other techs because you will rush, and the projects are hard when you&#39;re rushing.

The material and lectures are very dry and boring, with tons of information(with very little break in-between concepts during videos).

Not useful in many Software Engineering jobs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>161 = Excellent course, and a great intro for someone interested in security. Projects are very chill(not easy, require lots of thought, but not much code and can certainly be rushed). Well run with excellent staff and professors who care a lot. The work comes in bursts, which is nice because there&#39;s plenty of time to study the material. The first month can seem a bit hectic, but it dies around around month 1.5. Tests are fair, not easy, but if you study a lot, you should expect to get at least 1 std below, which may seem bad, but can reassure people who are afraid of failing.

Only 2 projects, took me 1-3 days each, and you have about 3 weeks to complete them. Very easy material to digest, and thus tests can be a bit tricky at times, but most people get high scores and the curve is a little less forgiving.
