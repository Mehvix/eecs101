As an average student in terms of study habits, I&#39;d say I had most nights/weekends free, except during project days and before exams. I think I spent maybe 4 to 5 nights on the CPU project, about 2/3 on each of the other three projects, and would study for 2 or 3 days before the exams. So, altogether not an overwhelming commitment that I had time for nothing else. If you&#39;re someone who likes to start studying 10 days before the exams (which is hard to do during the summer), then expect to spend a lot more time on the class. Note that the first week or two can be rough if it&#39;s your first exposure to a C-like language.</p>", "created": "2020-04-09T05:20:27Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "id": "k8sbbyt6pdn3lg", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jkwx8cjjhgga0", "name": "Billy Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jkwx8cjjhgga0"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11503": 4, "2809": 6, "3504": 9, "4078": 3, "4305": 7, "4317": 1, "5512": 0, "6272": 5, "6975": 2, "7108": 8}}, "created": "2020-04-09T00:38:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Any advice for taking CS61C in the summer now that it is online?
