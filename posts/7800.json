However, even though CalCentral will allow enrollment into both classes, it is still the student\u2019s responsibility to plan their schedule carefully.\u00a0Departments and faculty are NOT required or expected to accommodate students\u2019 schedule conflicts, and the Instructor of Record may decline to enroll or Instructor Drop a student from a class if they cannot be present for all schedule activities, including midterms and finals.<br /><br />Best practice is to check attendance policies for each class and to speak to the instructors before enrolling in time conflicted classes.<br /><br /></p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Waitlist Processing:</strong></p>\n</li></ol>\n<ul><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will NOT purge the waitlist of non-CS/EECS majors at the end of phase 1 this semester.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the Adjustment Period, wait lists are automatically processed in numerical order based on the waitlist position. A student\u2019s major is NOT taken into consideration when the wait list is processed. During Phases 1 and 2, students who meet reserve requirements for a class will be enrolled from the wait list if there are open seats, even before students with a better wait list position who do not meet reserve requirements.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If enrolling the student into the class will put them over the maximum number of units, the system will also skip the student when processing the wait list. Units for wait listed classes count towards the upper unit limit: 13.5 phase 1, 17.5 phase 2, and 20 units over all.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Waitlisted students who have time conflicts\u00a0will no longer be held on the waitlist and will now be processed in sequential order like any other student. (As in the past, not meeting a reserve cap or exceeding the unit limit will still prevent students from being enrolled from the wait list.)<br /><br /><em>Students on the waitlist for a class are NOT guaranteed to get into the class and should make a reasonable back-up plan.</em><br /><br /></p>\n</li></ul>\n<ol start=\"4\"><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>70% Rule</strong> - When hiring is uncertain for discussion section GSI/TA staff, we hold back 30% of seats as code 55 or \u2018permission required\u2019.

Additionally, the 999 section has no scheduled day or time which reduces the number of time conflicts that must be processed online.
