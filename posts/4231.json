Deciding to go for the sim. degree really depends on what your goals are. Taking more classes means you will have less time for side projects, research, socializing, etc. You can be very clever with how you count your classes (for instance,\u00a0while you are only allowed to double count 2 upper division classes, you can double count as many lower division classes as you like between the two degrees). I say only do the simultaneous degree if you absolutely want both degrees. For me, it was worth it since I felt no degree really met the requirements for what I wanted to do (computational biology). I would have done L&amp;S CS\u00a0if I was more interested in straight up software engineering and I would have stuck to\u00a0Bioengineering alone\u00a0if I didn&#39;t like programming so much. Also, keep in mind just how valuable a CS or EECS degree will be and consider the option of minoring in engineering.
