If you do 170&#43;189&#43;168 I personally think that&#39;s ok but as you can see many other students might think completely otherwise. Just make sure your final decision is made by you, not others. I think the notion of &#34;difficulty&#34; is extremely subjective - don&#39;t sway yourself one way or another just because of consensus or status quo. Go with what you feel in your mind and your heart. This is a very personal issue to me and I want to speak out about it, because I feel like we are all assumed to be one kind of student with a very narrow band of capabilities. Some of us feel it is only right to do 1 tech a semester and then there are others of us who are so excited we want 5 techs - the Berkeley student body is diverse and I have friends from both sides of the aisle!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are some very rare but exceptionally respected students that can handle several techs and participate in clubs and volunteer in their communities, leading productive and happy lives. Of course this is difficult, but these kinds of people have a real potential to be our future leaders and presidents. But then there are others who don&#39;t prioritize classes and instead are focused on their research or their frat or their racing season - which in itself can be a very wise decision.
