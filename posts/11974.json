If you have already taken a course that is equivalent to 54, then you&#39;re somewhat prepared for the linear algebra portion of 16A. This is typically the first third of the course. With regards to 61A, your experience in Python will help you if you&#39;ve previously dabbled in the concepts the course touches upon -- feel free to browse cs61a.org and see if the concepts are familiar to you. Python is typically around one-half to two-thirds of the course curriculum, so depending on your experience you should be good for that amount of time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, the remaining portions of each course may be completely new to you, and depending on how quickly you grasp the material you may find yourself struggling to keep up. I don&#39;t doubt that you can do it, but I encourage you to browse both courses&#39; websites well in advance (cs61a.org and eecs16a.org) to get yourself somewhat familiar with the concepts, as the stuff covered over summer is essentially the same as the stuff covered in a regular semester. If you feel like you&#39;ll be able to keep up, there&#39;s no downside to taking both over summer :)</p>", "created": "2020-04-23T06:51:12Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jzkuy4i1v765ox"}], "id": "k9ceql4l6c13b7", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k90srhwqdt53ki", "name": "Aryan Jain", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["k90srhwqdt53ki"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-23T21:23:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9d9wir0bfr1o0", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thank you for responding!
