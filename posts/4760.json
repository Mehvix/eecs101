I&#39;m currently filling it out in order to declare L&amp;S CS as my second major and because I&#39;m going to be a senior now, the old requirements still apply to me. Having picked up CS so late, I still have one last class to take to finish the 7 prereqs, but I would like to declare early just so that I will actually be able to get into the classes I need next semester and hopefully graduate on time. With my grades in the 5 classes I have so far (still waiting for the grade from the 6th this summer), I should be able to make the 3.0 cutoff alright, but probably won&#39;t make the 3.4 required for early declaration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve heard conflicting things about\u00a0when the statement of purpose is actually taken into consideration so I was just hoping for some clarification on that.
