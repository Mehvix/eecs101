These students will\u00a0either study CS elsewhere, or study something else at Berkeley.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Constraint 2: L&amp;S&#39;s philosophy is to not commit incoming students to a\u00a0specific major. CoE does not have this philosophy.</p>\n<p>Corollary A to constraint 2: If the current\u00a0split between the two\u00a0versions of CS (L&amp;S and CoE) remains, then the\u00a0solution to the corollary to constraint 1 is that students will be filtered out when they apply for the major.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Corollary B to constraint 2: If L&amp;S&#39;s\u00a0CS department is shut down, then\u00a0we can control the number of\u00a0people in CS via admissions.</p>\n<p>Corollary C to constraint 2: If CoE&#39;s EECS department is shut down, then we\u00a0have the same issue as currently.</p>\n<p>Corollary D to constraint 2: If\u00a0L&amp;S changes their philosophy to match CoE, then we have reduced the problem to corollary B.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Constraint 3: There aren&#39;t\u00a0many ways to filter\u00a0students out when they apply for the major. Performance in the lower division classes is the simplest\u00a0and probably most reasonable way.</p>\n<p>Corollary to constraint 3: Hence, if students are to be filtered out at this stage,\u00a0a GPA cap is\u00a0the most reasonable approach. There is\u00a0precedence for this, which works and is\u00a0fair.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Based on this:</p>\n<p>Solution 1: Use a GPA cap. This can be\u00a0undesirable because students will not know if they can get into the major until spending a year or so at Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Solution 2: Close off L&amp;S&#39;s CS department. This can be undesirable because students have diverse interests that do not relate to engineering, and other people may become interested in the major late.</p>\n<p>Semi-Solution (that has already been proposed):\u00a0As a compromise between the two,\u00a0there\u00a0can be a heavier push for anyone\u00a0applying to Berkeley who knows they want to study CS to apply for EECS, and have some way of not\u00a0requiring them to go through CoE&#39;s\u00a0requirements (as opposed to the current website which suggests that both are equally reasonable paths).

Wow, I really missed a lot of discussion while visiting SoCal. Let me clarify a few things: We have two separate proposals that will be reviewed at the next College of Letters and Sciences Executive Committee Meeting (the body that reviews all program changes to majors). First is to change the declaration prerequisites from the current scheme to just CS61A/B/70 instead. You still need to take all 7, but only need those three to officially declare. There are many reasons for this, but essentially they have a stronger correlation to performance in the major than the math courses and CS61C. To someone&#39;s question of, &#34;Why not CS61C&#34;, in part because there isn&#39;t a strong correlation to upper-division performance since contemporary students aren&#39;t as adept nor interested in lower-level of abstraction work and wish to, instead, focus on higher-level software engineering found in courses like 160, 169, 188, etc.. We have students who really struggle in CS61C but perform well in the rest of their coursework. \n\nThe proposed prereq set also lets students declare much earlier (as early as semester two) so there isn&#39;t that &#34;gap&#34; term where you stress about getting into upper-division courses. It also lets those students who are struggling know about the major earlier so they can make alternative arrangements instead of hoping to improve later on despite the fact that the data shows this rarely pans out and often offers false hope. The new scheme, if approved, should benefit the vast majority of students and students tend to perform a bit better in CS61A/B than in Math54/CS61C; we all know CS70 is difficult but it&#39;s also very relevant and applies to a large body of future coursework. \n\nThe second proposal is to raise the required GPA to a 3.3. To the best of my knowledge (and I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty good) this would only apply to incoming students who are admitted this year--aka NOT to any current students. There&#39;s been much discussion about the fairness of this, and I agree that it isn&#39;t ideal and I wish there was a silver bullet to fix things. Historically we&#39;ve had higher GPA requirements and we&#39;ve had numerical caps for literally decades before removing all departmental constraints in 2007 (we had ~130 majors at the time). Keep the following in mind:\nThe largest we&#39;ve ever been in history was 282.\nWe waited until we eclipsed 400 before even proposing a GPA requirement and though it was just after the 2012 class was admitted, we tried to message it broadly for 18 months so students could avoid the GPA requirement and declare a semester earlier--by using summer session or taking an extra course etc.. This worked for *almost* all of the students though some were not able to or didn&#39;t know. \nThe faculty &amp; ugrad study committee deliberately chose as low of a GPA as possible in an effort to be more inclusive than in historical enrollment surges.\nWe currently have 904 majors. Yes we&#39;re more than *triple* the largest we&#39;ve ever been in *history*, and we managed to grow by this much in just over 2 years--it&#39;s pretty incredible. Applied math, Econ, and Stats are in similar positions though Stats has attenuated this with their 3.2 GPA requirement. \nEcon requires a 3.0 &amp; Stats a 3.2; Also, Psych, PE, Art Practice, Media Studies, and more have GPA or other constraints.\n\nThe proposals will not be reviewed until May, so even if they&#39;re unequivocally approved, they&#39;re not likely to be implemented until the end of May (for 3 prereq declaration) and to incoming freshman (for new GPA requirement). We messaged this to incoming students so they can fully factor this in while deciding on where to attend by the SIR deadline. I personally agree with many of the sentiments I&#39;m reading, but given our growth, continued commitment to a larger body of students, and need to retain the quality of our courses and programs, it seems like the best solution by far. In the past we&#39;ve had a numerical cap but then you have no idea what GPA to aim for in order to be competitive; this system is transparent, focused, and still attainable. Given the data I&#39;ve reviewed, this should not displace a &#34;majority&#34; of students as some have suggested. Displacing any student goes against my personal philosophy but I think the department is trying very hard. I hope this clarifies, or better yet, mitigates some of the panic I&#39;m sensing. Also, I don&#39;t mean to sound defensive, but I was alarmed at how out of context many of my remarks were. I&#39;ve consistently said what I put in print here, but I think it&#39;s quite easy to conflate the proposals, timelines, and populations given how complicated everything is.
