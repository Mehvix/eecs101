There are two big sides to PL research (among many, <strong>many</strong> others): high-level theory on the soundness of languages and low-level optimization techniques. IMO it&#39;s quite infeasible to hit both in depth during a single semester and so 164 chooses to focus on lower-level aspects of compilers and chooses to defer the soundness/design aspects to 263.<br /><br />As someone who&#39;s actively working on PL research around functional programming languages here, I totally get the point that 164 should cover functional languages. There are some pretty significant optimization challenges when function values are involved as well as interesting programming paradigms to explore. However, as I see it, 164 is focused on empowering you with the skills to implement your own language <strong>completely from scratch</strong>. That means writing your own parser, your own typechecker, your own assembly emitter. It&#39;s true that many of these components are drastically simplified and almost eliminated by tools like tree-sitter (for parsing) and LLVM (for emitting assembly), but these both are active projects too so we as students should be capable of understanding and contributing to them too! And, in the case of Fall 2019, we got a fair bit of exposure to the compiler side of FP anyways as the final included a major section on implementing closures.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kcvz9o2gwq214q": 1608236399}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jkp12vta3zd1yt", "name": "Rohan Koodli", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "name": "Ashwin Vangipuram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jyq487ctcwuk8": 1575938629}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvi1vf5f76o1", "name": "Gautam Mittal", "photo": "1540769048_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvi1vf5f76o1/1540769048_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jkp12vta3zd1yt", "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "jktvi1vf5f76o1"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jkooeqz3ngl11j", "updated": "2020-03-02T18:43:08Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/1 - 3/7", "bucket_order": 66, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-03-02T19:18:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k7auitzqakl6k0", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I haven&#39;t taken 162, but I took 164 last fall with Sen.
