Because you&#39;ll be comfortable with the probability and the linear algebra, you will be able to concentrate on the machine learning concepts and take them in. Not having optimization will mean that there will be a few times when the simultaneous presence of optimization ideas and new machine learning ideas will cause you to have to work significantly harder, and you might not get as much out of that part as someone with stronger foundations there. \u00a0The real concern is students who have none of Math110, EECS126/Stat134, EECS127, and CS170. They might be in for real trouble as they have to simultaneously understand probability, linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning. If they also haven&#39;t had EE16AB, then it&#39;s probably completely hopeless to actually understand the concepts. After all, machine learning is essentially the application of optimization within a framework deeply informed by linear-algebraic and probabilistic intuition to problems of data-driven pattern recognition using computers. A certain level of comfort with the tools is extremely helpful. Otherwise, it&#39;s like taking a Sanskrit literature class given in Sanskrit without really understanding Sanskrit. Sure, the point of the Sanskrit literature class is the literature, but not knowing Sanskrit really well is going to cause difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The unambiguous recommendation for students who have taken 70 is to take 126 as their main probability course. This is because 126 can count on 70 and thereby go beyond in many ways, including in connecting more deeply to EECS-relevant applications and probabilistic modeling itself. If you&#39;ve already taken 134, you should have a conversation with the 126 Prof to see whether it is a good fit for you or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-08-02T03:58:34Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j5uhg06e4ll6qq", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ixj56cq4o911qa": 1, "iy7nq0jv6wu1r3": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "itek8117ve07gl", "name": "Yining Liu", "photo": "1528830792_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/itek8117ve07gl/1528830792_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzab6kpr3c048h", "name": "Justin Luke", "photo": "1473540382_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzab6kpr3c048h/1473540382_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"j6b1o0sq8uz77d": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iduqoh9fk9oju", "name": "Yuzheng Jia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkfr46v4g91se", "name": "David Chung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567784220, "j7s01y165odq5": 1526596257, "jr0d08qbk7i3s6": 1555082786}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ipraxv6jn6h0", "name": "Aditya Jhanwar", "photo": "1568219580_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6ipraxv6jn6h0/1568219580_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["itek8117ve07gl", "is6p6uis14y5ot", "hzab6kpr3c048h", "iduqoh9fk9oju", "ipkfr46v4g91se", "j6ipraxv6jn6h0"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/30 - 8/5", "bucket_order": 138, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 7/30 - 8/5", "bucket_order": 138, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-08-02T16:07:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j5v7he17xia34c", "subject": "<p>That&#39;s the thing. It is very hard to self-study the foundations of probability and optimization, because it is a way of thinking and a perspective rather than specific concepts per se. From a practical perspective, it is probably far more profitable to spend time really reviewing EE16AB, CS70, and Math 53 material to make sure you know it very well. There you have the advantage of actually being able to build on courses that you actually took with lectures and discussions that you actually attended to let the ways of thinking seep into your brain, reinforced by homeworks, labs, and exams that you also struggled with and completed. The basic foundations of optimization thinking were laid down for you in 16A (positioning module where least squares was introduced) and 16B (least-norm solutions, psuedoinverses, etc.), The SVD/PCA foundations laid in 16B are of course critical, and the exposure to k-means (Lloyd-Max) in 16B (and 61A for that matter) is helpful. As is using all this stuff in lab and for the project. \u00a0The foundations of probability were laid down for you in 70, including a probabilistic perspective on the least-squares thinking that you had learned in 16A. From 53, you need to really understand what differentiation means for functions of vectors. (Of course, you saw a bit of this in 16B as well.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reviewing your lower-division is something that is actually doable. Beyond that, the next biggest bang-for-the-buck probably comes from understanding multivariate Gaussian distributions, and in particular, the effect of linear transformations on the densities of such Gaussians.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Everything beyond that is likely not worth trying to learn on your own.
