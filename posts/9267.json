You basically have to write a file sharing system. The design(considered the bulk of the project) wasn&#39;t hard for me, but figuring out which functions to use to implement my design was difficult. Also, writing sufficient tests for sharing and revoking files is crucial, since you might fail many tests if you just use the staff tests.
