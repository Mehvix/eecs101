Both were much less then other upper divs like 170/162. That being said the 188 midterms and exams were more difficult then 168. In general both classes are fairly light, and the material is pretty different so I&#39;d imagine the one you have more interest in the material would be easier, so I&#39;d go for that one.</p>", "created": "2016-03-26T03:52:23Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_4"}, {"anon": "full", "content": "I haven&#39;t taken 168, but 188 is regarded as one of the lightest workload classes.
