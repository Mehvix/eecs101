When I tried printing from Firefox the printers on the second floor were not there, only the &#34;print to file&#34; option. I was wondering if there was a way to add a printer to the Ubuntu machines without root access. I tried adding a device but that required root access. And when I tried using the unix print utilities such as lpr, it said &#34;no destination available&#34;.\u00a0<br /><br /></div>\n<div>Is there a way to add a printer on the Ubuntu lab machines without root access? It would be great if someone could offer some help on this issue as that way I wouldn&#39;t have to spend 20 minutes each time trying to print something at Soda. Plus I know this is a common issue for many students trying to print at Soda.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Second question: is it possible to print from my own machine (Mac OS X) to one of the public printers?</div>\n<div></div>", "created": "2016-02-03T02:11:23Z", "subject": "Adding a Printer on Ubuntu Lab Machines", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "ik6771n6woe26q", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 906, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654555855508, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijht4t00q484ur", "name": "Darren Fong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"i9wx20u57ax257": 1, "jhmjlnly7zx60": 1533262076}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzfv0vq4iqc5kk", "name": "Peijie Li", "photo": "1523154375_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzfv0vq4iqc5kk/1523154375_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ijht4t00q484ur", "hzfv0vq4iqc5kk"], "tags": ["cs", "eecs", "other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 217}
