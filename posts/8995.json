When I took it, I felt like I did not need to spend as much time outside of lecture and discussion to understand concepts as I usually did in other classes so I could jump directly into the assignments. So overall 140 should not be significantly more work but a lot more worthwhile. I would be\u00a0cautious of the other three classes that you already have on your schedule though, but if you&#39;re determined to take one of the two, take 140.</p>", "created": "2019-04-05T03:56:23Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "ju3jeodypwu57p", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-05T00:37:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>just wondering what the major differences would be.\u00a0 I&#39;ve got a mix of medium to hard technicals for Fall and wanted to perhaps balance it out with 134 if I&#39;m not missing out on too much (STAT C100, CS 170, CS 61C)</p>", "created": "2019-04-05T00:37:35Z", "subject": "STAT 140 or STAT 134", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ju3cb0jlxdu3c1", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8995, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547209298, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 310}
