Regardless of how you&#39;re doing in classes, you know more about CS than the vast majority of people out there and will probably be fine in the long run.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d also suggest keeping an open mind about career paths, since you never know where life will take you. Maybe you&#39;ll want to work a tech job in a non-tech industry, or maybe you&#39;ll find that you&#39;re into something else entirely. There&#39;s a good chance you won&#39;t have to be a super hardcore CS person to do the job really well. Hell, my\u00a0plans for what classes I&#39;m gonna take and when\u00a0has changed a zillion times since I started college (and I&#39;m a sophomore), how am I supposed to know what I&#39;ll be doing 5-10 years after graduation? Lol</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Re: friendships - I feel you on this one. I came from a really small high school where people knew each other very, very well - almost too well. If you made a bad impression when you started school you were pretty much screwed for the next 4 years (I guess that&#39;s true to some degree for all high schools but wtv). I had a very close circle of friends who I pretty much spent all my time with, and I&#39;m still in contact with them to this day. But it felt limiting, and that&#39;s why I chose to move across the country to Berkeley, even as the only person from my high school class to come here.</p>\n<p>I was very overconfident in my ability to make new friends and didn&#39;t take into account how different college friendships - and high school friendships - are from high school, especially at a huge public school like Berkeley.\u00a0I had my fair share of terrible experiences my first year trying to meet people and adjusting to Berkeley&#39;s individualistic culture.</p>\n<p>By &#34;individualistic culture&#34;, I mean that we&#39;re all super ambitious and have our own goals, which makes opportunities for sharing time with people harder to come by. Friendships these days tend to have a more specific focus - I have my CS friends where we pretty much only ever talk about CS stuff, I&#39;m friends with my roommates where we just kinda talk about the things that happen to us throughout the day, etc. Other people bond pretty strongly over clubs. The people using you for homework help? They might actually be trying to connect, and that&#39;s the easiest way they feel they can do that when that&#39;s the only connection you share with them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I&#39;ve learned about friendships the last two years -</p>\n<p>1. Friendships now\u00a0require time, and most importantly effort. In high school you&#39;re forced to spend time with the same people a lot, which means friendships could form even when you don&#39;t try to make them happen. This isn&#39;t true at all in college, especially in a department as big as CS/EECS, or in real life - you need to put in the work to make new friendships, and even to maintain the ones you already have. Which ties nicely into my next point:</p>\n<p>2. Keep putting yourself out there. I struggle with this all the time - yeah it&#39;s scary, but it&#39;s one of those things you have to do. You will fall flat on your face time and time again - I certainly did. Maybe people won&#39;t be responsive, or you don&#39;t vibe with them, whatever. There are times when it will suck. But you&#39;re still closer to finding real connections if you&#39;re putting yourself out there than if you&#39;re not, even if it takes you years to find them. You miss 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take. And the shots you do take? I guarantee you you&#39;ll find a hit eventually :)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Keep your head up!
