Students will develop a fundamental understanding of the state-of-the-art, design processes and product realization. Teams will prototype a novel non-invasive solution to a disabilities-related challenge, focusing on upper-limb mobility or dexterity. Lessons will cover biomechanics of manipulation, tactile sensing and haptics, actuation and mechanism robustness, and control interfaces. Readings will be selected from academic journals and course notes. Guest speakers will be invited to address cutting edge breakthroughs relevant to assistive tech.</div>\n<div><br />This course includes sufficient treatment of engineering principles that it may be\u00a0used to fulfill College of Engineering undergraduate unit requirements.\u00a0The course also satisfies the Advanced Design requirement for the\u00a0<a href=\"http://designinnovationcertificate.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation</a>.\u00a0<br /><br /><b>Prerequisites</b></div>\n<div><b>This course is targeted at upper division undergraduates, Master&#39;s, and PhD students.
