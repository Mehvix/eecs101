This is probably the most open-ended project you can do in an EECS design class, as far as I know (the only requirement is that it builds off of some of the concepts discussed in lecture). So you can end up making something really cool that you can talk about in future interviews, etc.</p>\n<p>- At least when I took the class, the lab GSIs were extremely friendly and helpful. You can spend a lot of time in the lab working on your project and talking to them, which will help you build academic relationships that can be very good for your future.</p>\n<p>- Most of the projects involve taking some existing platform and building on top of it, which is pretty good experience for real-world\u00a0embedded software work.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Just being able to say that I was in a class specifically about embedded systems helped me get several interviews and eventually an internship working with embedded software.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<p>- The actual\u00a0lecture content is pretty minimal. We did a lot of theory of finite state machines and covered some basics of networking and scheduling. However, if you&#39;ve already taken CS 162, you&#39;ve already learned much more about scheduling than you will in EECS 149, and I assume the same thing is true about CS 168 and networking. I&#39;ve personally already forgotten most of the networking and scheduling\u00a0content I learned in 149.</p>\n<p>- Since every group in the class works on a\u00a0totally different project, if you get completely stuck it&#39;s a lot harder for others to help you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope this helps in some way!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-03-10T23:08:51Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-11T06:17:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>If you&#39;re interested in embedded software, 149 is obviously more relevant to that. 151 is pretty different, although it does give you some knowledge that would be good to keep in mind when\u00a0working in\u00a0embedded software.</p>\n<p><br />If you can, I would recommend taking both.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you only want to take one, I would recommend 149 since it&#39;s more relevant to your interests.

The lecture wasn&#39;t\u00a0really useful in my opinion (it was a lot of theory that I thought didn&#39;t really help much in the project and labs), but\u00a0it gave a good overview of a bunch of different topics. The problem is that it doesn&#39;t go in depth in one thing, so it leaves you feeling kind of confused.
