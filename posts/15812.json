Whenever I have asked this question the answer has been something like, \"as soon as possible, but you might want to take a relevant class or two first.\"\n\nI have heard that \"junior year\" might be the wrong answer to this question. This is because\n* Some professors might not even prefer to work with a junior over a sophomore. This would be because they do not want you to graduate before you have stayed with them long enough to make progress on something. (I have heard this from biology and CS people.)\n* Rumor has it that many PhD programs want three letters of recommendation from professors who know you as a researcher or as a member of course staff. (I heard this from many people.)\n* Research in a seemingly irrelevant topic might be better than nothing at all, since rumor has it that there are generally applicable skills involved, such as knowing how to struggle and fail. (I heard this from a physics person.)\n\nCaveats:\n* This varies depending on your field. For example, rumor has it that math majors do not typically expect to be able to do original research right away. I don't know where machine learning stands on the scale of things, but my impression is that it involves at least a few boring things, like data cleaning or manual validation of datasets, that freshpersons and sophomores could probably do.\n* This information is not based on direct experience, but I just thought I would relay what I have heard to you since you are a freshperson who might not already have heard the same.</md>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-10-09T17:30:55Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "md"}, "created": "2021-10-10T09:11:28Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kul0bpl9kjb8g", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<md>The optimal answer is as soon as possible. The longer you work for a professor, even if it is just grunt work, the longer you work in research, the higher the likelihood that you can gain more experience and more opportunity to work on more meaningful research. Also good for good letters of recommendations from professors/ researchers for graduate school or future research positions. \n\nThe more realistic answer is while you are taking 189/127/126/182/188, etc. series of courses. Some faculty might take you in while you have taken some, but not all of these courses. If you have like A+s in all of your lower divs and show high level of math maturity, there is some finite chance that a faculty will take a stab at you because it is probably likely that you will excel at the upper division classes as well.  </md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdkuvqljxy44vr": 1607625548, "kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1601959995}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kblvdga2rwv6", "name": "Peter Donovan", "photo": "1625248968_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kblvdga2rwv6/1625248968_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kblvdga2rwv6"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g", "updated": "2021-10-10T09:11:28Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11988": 7, "12152": 9, "12432": 2, "13279": 4, "14247": 1, "14392": 0, "15200": 6, "15220": 3, "4480": 5, "7064": 8}}, "created": "2021-10-09T16:14:14Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a freshman interested in ML and want to do a PhD, but I always feel like being late and stressed to do research.
