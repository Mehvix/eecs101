I&#39;m currently a sophomore who has taken pretty much the same classes that you have, with 126 instead of 61c, and I would definitely recommend that you at least take 126 concurrently with ML research, as it helps you with probabilistic reasoning.

Let&#39;s separate out two issues: getting research and actually doing it &amp; contributing.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Essentially everyone who starts out in research starts out as a helpful minion. They help grad students or more senior undergraduates by actually doing experiments or writing code. As they are helpful, they begin to absorb the context of the work as well as develop relationships with their mentors. Through conversations, they begin to pick up what the actual intellectual motivations are. For this, understanding the very basics is super critical. This is why for ML type research, courses like 126 and 127 are essential. These provide the background required to actually engage in the conversation. Of course, the next level of basics like 189 are also useful because they introduce you to more of the ML specific\u00a0 issues. But you don&#39;t really need that to be able to start contributing --- you need to be able to write code and do experiments. DeCals like the <a href=\"mailto:ML&#64;Berkeley\">ML&#64;Berkeley</a>\u00a0one can help, as well as your foundational programming oriented courses. Even after 16AB, you&#39;re going to have some degree of familiarity with numpy. It is your mentors that are going to be teaching you the day-to-day things you will be needing at first.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As time goes on, it is the intellectual frameworks from foundational courses that will help weaponize your instinctive curiosity in the context of the lab&#39;s intellectual atmosphere --- then you will begin to be able to contribute at a more significant level.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So as you can see, there is no tension between doing the research and taking courses in the proper order to build strong foundations.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Turning to getting research opportunities, this is where things get tricky. There are so many undergrads and so many of them flake out that faculty are often wary about adding people to projects when they are unreliable. Here is where you basically need to stand out and demonstrate that you are not a flake, and can actually do something. Doing very well in courses and talking to your TAs is certainly one thing that you can do. Being on course staff and going above and beyond is another. You need to get noticed. Faculty and grad students on course staff can help connect you to their peers since most research opportunities are not advertised. (Some are --- there you need to apply and put yourself out there.) So, do courses matter? Yes and no. Taking courses and follow-on courses is a part of what helps you get on course staff. Being reliable on course staff allows you to demonstrate your reliability and going above and beyond shows your talents. (For example, volunteer to make demos illustrating lecture concepts. Anything that lets you do good work that demonstrates a deep engagement with the material and can get you noticed.) With the advent of 16AB, it is possible to start contributing on course staff relevant to ML pretty early in your undergrad career.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-10-11T07:34:42Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jn49pi10a5i6yp", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy37bcv7ngg704", "name": "Timothy Toombs", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ib88zxkn1kkfr", "name": "Irving Fang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5bus35fznj2q1", "name": "Joshua Zhou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzpndq5jv06214", "name": "Ching Fang", "photo": "1489260148_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzpndq5jv06214/1489260148_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jip1ye5zsh511j", "name": "Haley Shih", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"jjnjp9mea54uy": 1536696387}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy6ln9pj1pi", "name": "Srinivasa Pranav", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1557212965, "jpdq1epqrr3231": 1557211704, "jqtyr3q4ryo4z3": 1554878989}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3qb8b5k8gni8", "name": "Bryan Chen", "photo": "1548706388_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j3qb8b5k8gni8/1548706388_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jw6kndsic346lm": 1562983101}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3h2nh0k3ho", "name": "Nikhil Jain", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1551343370, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548558104, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1574919273}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "name": "Priyans Desai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iy37bcv7ngg704", "ib88zxkn1kkfr", "j5bus35fznj2q1", "hzpndq5jv06214", "jip1ye5zsh511j", "icguy6ln9pj1pi", "j3qb8b5k8gni8", "j6nu3h2nh0k3ho", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "jjs6ge7urqc129"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-11T02:52:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "suggestion_box", "faculty_advising", "research"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>The short story is that i am conflicting between starting on undergraduate research as soon as possible to strengthen my C.V for grad school application while I would also like to take more courses in my undergradauate year for a better foundation.</p>\n<p>The long story is that I am a sophomore CS student who\u2019s done well in 61ABC, 70, 16B, math 54 53 and CS170.
