This is a full-time position from June 13-July 29. The hourly starting pay is $18.97-$19.33, but can be higher commensurate with experience.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Anne Mayoral, the director, is looking for candidates with strong organizational and interpersonal skills who can help her run the program, which introduces different areas of engineering to middle school children. This is a great opportunity to learn the details of what goes into making a large university program happen.</div>\n<br />\n<div><strong>About Girls in Engineering:</strong> The curriculum focuses on hands-on activities, touring research labs around campus, and meeting cool researchers. This year&#39;s theme is sustainability, and it looks very interesting. (I want to attend myself!) GiE provides access for students from underserved communities where engineering resources and programs may be harder to come by - about half the campers are on scholarships.</div>\n<br />\n<div><strong>Personal note:</strong> Anne is my neighbor and is super awesome. I participated in GiE as a computer science expert last year, and found the team to be incredibly supportive, happy, and organized. You&#39;ll be in a great work environment.</div>\n<br />\n<div><strong>Interested?</strong> Send Anne an email expressing your interest at <strong>gie@berkeley.edu</strong>.
