We&#39;ve seen some questions on here and wanted to answer them and hopefully anything else you&#39;re wondering about.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We have every intention of covering all of the material that is usually covered in the semester. This includes lab, as we do not plan on offering a &#34;no lab&#34; option. I created all the labs for the 16B pilot, so they are very close to my heart. I want every student to have the opportunity to chase their 16 car around, even if it&#39;s not in Cory basement. I am currently working with our awesome staff and the dept to make sure that labs are tweaked appropriately, and that students can get the necessary hardware to keep the labs as normal as possible.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We will be opening another section of 16B and expanding the current ones, as soon as we know we can staff it. We hope to offer 16B to as many students as wish to take it, and at times that meet the needs of students in other\u00a0timezones, just as long as we don&#39;t kill our TAs trying!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lecture, discussion, and lab will be live. We will make exceptions for conflicts with lecture, and record it. However, we have a lot of discussion and lab\u00a0sections, so they will be live and you skip them at your own peril. Exams will follow any\u00a0campus policies that apply; we intend for them to be online and at a given time (currently without exception).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Emily Naviasky, Forrest Laine, and Simon Kuang</p>", "created": "2020-04-15T16:41:52Z", "subject": "EE16B Summer Answers", "uid": "idq5nbz3j0d4ir"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k91kbdfvugd5db", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11837, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654543998864, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkmujgst23w", "name": "Nicholas Nolan", "photo": "1563649904_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6gtkmujgst23w/1563649904_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvi3vvjo56q3", "name": "Hans Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "name": "Rishi Veerapaneni", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrx7lxeqz3e4", "name": "Tsai-Jwu (Judy)", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6wldnh09m0nu", "name": "Katie Lamar", "photo": "1592000847_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6wldnh09m0nu/1592000847_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jktvex6279x3zb", "j6gtkmujgst23w", "jktvi3vvjo56q3", "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "j6lrx7lxeqz3e4", "j6wldnh09m0nu"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 569}
