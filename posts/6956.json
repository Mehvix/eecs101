Realistically, probability at the level of EECS126 (preferred) or Stat 140 (also ok) is extremely helpful in understanding 189. There is no escaping the central role of optimization (EECS 127), probability (EECS 126), and linear algebra (EE16AB) in machine learning. Without having a visceral understanding of these to build upon, the machine learning content will be obscured for many students and it will take a lot of time to get.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There should be no confusion about what 189/289A is: an advanced upper-division undergraduate course that &#34;introduces&#34; machine learning. I put &#34;introduces&#34; in scare-quotes because really, students have already been introduced to lots of topics core to machine learning in the lower-division in EE16A and EE16B. To the extent that the machine learning content of EE16AB alone would probably be a quarter-long course in a school that ran on quarters. 189 in effect assumes this and builds upon it to emphasize the machine learning considerations. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Linear models play a critical role in 189, but we use that as a foundation to understand core issues and then as points of reference to help us understand nonlinear models.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2018-05-09T21:28:51Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-09T16:48:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jgzc8gzpvmj1mp", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Based solely on the name of the course &#39;linear modeling&#39; it would seem stat 151a deals with linear models, linear/logistic regression, confidence intervals, whereas 189 deals with inherently non-linear models such as neural networks. 151a seems to rely on having taken stat 134/135 whereas 189 requires math 53/54 and cs70 level probability.
