Find a good homework/study group!! I can&#39;t repeat how important this is, I found EE16A/EE16B manageable and fun because of my group.</p>\n<p>2. Make sure to understand the techniques taught in the class, and be able to use them without errors (and ideally\u00a0do them fast without errors).\u00a0Many homework/test problems in the class\u00a0rely on a underlying set of mechanical techniques (e.g. Guassian elimination, solving for eigenvalue/eigenvectors, nodal analysis, etc). The most common problem\u00a0I&#39;ve seen as a student and as a TA are people misusing the techniques or making\u00a0accidental\u00a0arithmetic errors.</p>\n<p>3. Ask questions! In lecture, in discussion, and office hours. Concepts can be confusing and the best way to clarify them is to ask questions when the arise. Lecture notes, class notes, and discussion solutions are your friend as well. Outside resources are iffy (sometimes they cover too much/too little and notation can be inconsistent with the class), so use them with caution (note, I do not think they are necessary to do well in the class).</p>\n<p>4. Practice, practice, practice. (Why? See point 2.) But remember to practice smart. I&#39;ve seen a few students who have practiced a lot but repeat the same mistake throughout. When practicing make sure to take systematic breaks to understand the mistakes you are making and how to fix them.</p>\n<p>Hope these help!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "updated": "2019-01-17T20:27:39Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-17T02:05:04Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p></p><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Hey guys! hope everyone&#39;s having a great break.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll be taking EE16A with CS61A and one breadth next semester.
