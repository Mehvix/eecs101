Now in Phase 2, I just want to keep all the classes I am registered, and on the waitlist for. I am not sure how to do this, and if I would have to cancel the swap, but my priority is to keep my current spot on the UGBA waitlist. What would you suggest? Is there anyway I can keep my positions and just cancel the swap since its phase 2?  I am EECS so I would not mind dropping 61B and resigning up now, but I am not sure if that will keep me on the waitlist based on the swap form. In addition, It does not let me sign up for more units, so while I am technically on the waitlist for 16, when the swap occurs or fails, I will only be in 12.", "created": "2017-11-28T18:38:06Z", "subject": "Cal Central Issues/ Advice", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jajytlvvve4wu", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5653, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550676115, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "enrollments", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 291}
