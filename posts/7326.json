It went badly. I passed 70 with the grade I needed to declare. I noticed early that I wouldn&#39;t do well in 16A and I P/NP. And even though I was falling behind in Math 54 I refused to drop it because a professor that I enjoyed was teaching it. I didn&#39;t P/NP it and now I have to retake it this coming semester.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As I look back now, the coursework was definitely manageable had I not been overly stressed about declaring. I heard too many horror stories about getting great grades in 61A/61B and crashing hard in 70. I sunk all my attention into that class. I wish I had dropped 54 or P/NP\u00a0when I realized I was falling behind. I can&#39;t really comment on what it is you&#39;re able to handle in a semester, but if you think you can do it, go ahead and try, but keep in mind the drop deadline just in case things get rough. Prioritize 70 as you want to declare. Assess your ability to handle the course load early in the semester so you can make the right choice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, I want to make a comparison between what you&#39;re doing with 61C and what I did with Math 54 (i.e. taking it because I enjoyed the professor). Unfortunately, we&#39;re all madly in love with Dan and it&#39;s hard not to jump at the opportunity to take something he&#39;s teaching, but if the course becomes too much, don&#39;t drag your way through it because of Dan. Drop it and take it with someone else, because if you fail you&#39;ll have to do it anyway. And if you pass, but didn&#39;t give it your all because of 70 then you may not leave getting everything you wanted from the course. But take my 61C advice with a grain of salt. I haven&#39;t taken it yet, plan to next Spring.</p>", "created": "2018-08-01T19:02:35Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is0qs34tpgu28x"}], "id": "jkbi0n6bxs6324", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6dtopnzrp2123", "name": "Cong(Andy)Jin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6dtopnzrp2123"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 7/29 - 8/4", "bucket_order": 87, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 7/29 - 8/4", "bucket_order": 87, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-08-03T16:48:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jke83a9rosob1", "subject": "<p>I&#39;m happy to hear that!
