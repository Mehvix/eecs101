"<p>2 things, 1, Averal is a king I love your Piazza posts, 2, that sounds odd Helix, because honestly guys like Pister and Sanders could give a @#!$ [don&#39;t ban me admins]. It sounds like you&#39;re prolly an underclassman who doesn&#39;t yet get what&#39;s the deeper thinking here, but as an old man senior, I can absolutely tell you after interviewing tons of faculty, there&#39;s such depth to what they choose to teach you and why, that whatever your conception of electrical engineering is, I know you&#39;re wrong, because electrical engineering is fundamentally about the following:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Simulating systems&#39; performances to get the best data in the shortest amount of time to ensure the most robust performance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&#39;s it. You can be an electrical engineer if you work for Eric Paulos [peep make.berkeley.edu] and write code all day. You might not be an electrical engineer if you work for Ron Fearing, maybe in EE 192 and see that writing low level C code or FPGA development has a lot to do with IDEs, and the effects of memory and other computation constraints on the algorithms you can use.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Electrical engineering, at a very deep level, and I say this btw as the complete definition of a failure in EECS, is the exact same thing at computer science. The two terms are self reflexive, and deeper still, mathematics is too. The series of numbers we have can be looked at as a binary graph, of either being 0 or not 0 and then a traversal of a path of primes that generate when we need to make a new node/neuron/binary term, and vice-versa. Consider the proofs of CS 70. Imagine you only had negation. Not only could you make a number line based on seeing and not seeing, via the binary example I gave, but you could develop geometry&#39;s and calculus&#39; syntax from the insertive paradoxes you could generate that point to real data [i.e. Zeno&#39;s paradox resolved by calculus&#39; definition of limits and the interchangeability of integrals to derivatives].\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So keep it woke. A first-order axiom proof technique is an EE concept...unless you&#39;re taking algorithms classes and you see the same patterns over and over again. All engineering convolves to systems design, i.e. how to make things the most robust via the data we can simulate to give us the information we need to update positioning.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, learning how to search for information is the BIG BIG berkeley idea, you&#39;d be surprised by how good at searching for info, and building information systems, you will become in general, which tragically is the point of an EE 16A/B system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For deeper insight, I would look at EE 219A, a course on the deep nature of simulation [<a href=\"http://potol.eecs.berkeley.edu/classWiki/tiki-index.php?page=EECS219A-Fall-2014\">http://potol.eecs.berkeley.edu/classWiki/tiki-index.php?page=EECS219A-Fall-2014</a>]. Deeper still, I&#39;d prolly ask what&#39;s your favorite sandwich, and what&#39;s the deepest method of updating to how you make a sandwich you can do to make the tastiest sandwich you can in your lifetime, as all life is just a deep cut of some highly dimensional function of reality\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p9mf96y2ty"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-06-13T03:56:35Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 6/7 - 6/13", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-06-13T04:26:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kbd50j8vgoq53o", "subject": "<p>Anon Scale, you dropped this: &#x1f451;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proof by counterexample: Classical closed-loop feedback systems (including most analog circuits) are not data-processing systems; they are actually brilliant because they circumvent data-processing. So, the data isn&#39;t really the focus, and any simulation used for modeling is really just a tool (just as much as any computer is a tool). The same argument goes for power system design, device physics, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for what &#34;electrical engineering&#34; is, I think it&#39;s a lot of things (which makes it so fun), including the collection of data and its processing. But I fundamentally disagree that it need be centered around information or computing. My main gripe is that no part of 16AB, the &#34;gateway&#34; to electrical engineering at this school, really focuses too hard on the actual *electricity* in electrical engineering (meaning that it isn&#39;t touched on in a useful manner anywhere in the EECS lower divs). Certainly the math is very important, which is also why 20 was a better &#34;math intro&#34; class than 16AB are, at least in terms of the concepts addressed and preparation for 120 (which is *the* EE class imo). As a 105 TA and student myself, it was incredibly clear that 16AB don&#39;t teach basic circuit analysis all too well either. I also think, structurally, making students take two classes in series as opposed to two (or even three if you include Math 54, but then 20/40/ Math 54 covers far more content than 16AB do) in parallel is just needlessly stressful. God forbid a 16C is ever introduced.

Despite that, the man deeply behind it, Dan Garcia, and others that follow his thinking, cannot make courses that are self-reflexive, encourage you to learn all the material rather than all-or-nothing efforts on exams, etc. Garcia, Hug, et. al. have developed the CS 9 series, which is functionally still less useful than just going online and trying to figure things out, because there is not one thing that is even remotely effective at being a context generating schema, at all. Even in statistics, the concept of the Black Swan, or the deep paradoxes of mathematics as a whole, suggests a powerful dynamic that all of this could go wrong regardless of how deeply engineered you make your world.
