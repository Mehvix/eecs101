Not fully sure if the first two are covered, but if you wanna study some beforehand, I&#39;d recommend looking over the least squares and projection notes on the EE16a website (would be the last third of the class minus the triangulation stuff) and the SVD/PCA notes on the EE16b website.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t taken 54 but instead Math 110, and these two main things aren&#39;t really covered there (we just barely looked at SVD for like a day when I took it, and never in the context of PCA), so studying over 54 would help, but 127 does assume an EE16b familiarity at least with stuff, even if they teach from the ground up. Also, note that EECS math classes are much more application and modeling heavy than the math department equivalent. The core idea in 127 is that we can take one problem and through modeling and manipulation force it to look like one that we already know how to solve (and then just throw it in a solver), as opposed to proving linear algebra theorems or how these algorithms work or anything. Some people who only know the math from the math side tend to have a more difficult time with this, but you know yourself best.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR It&#39;s definitely doable, but Math 54 linear algebra\u00a0is a subset EE16ab and not in the same style, so be wary</p>", "created": "2019-10-22T19:01:17Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k227sqpbhob32b", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhln7qf4679", "name": "James Jung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "name": "Ashwin Vangipuram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvhln7qf4679", "jktvgwu8z5z5gy"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-22T03:52:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "If I take the time to study a little bit extra over winter break, would it be ok to take 127 in the spring?", "created": "2019-10-22T03:52:15Z", "subject": "Taking 127 with just math 54 knowledge", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k21bbpum5fw2kb", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10501, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545428533, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfb2816p49g", "name": "Stella Wan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvfb2816p49g"], "tags": ["student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 244}
