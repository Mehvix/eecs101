The Bioengineering Honor Society is hosting its 8th annual BioEHSC\u2122, the nation\u2019s largest Bioengineering High School Competition! We\u2019re looking for students like you who are willing to mentor teams from all backgrounds. As a mentor, you will be guiding a high school team in designing a biological or medical engineering project, which they will present in a final research symposium on April 10th. You can use this opportunity to help students by bringing in your EE/CS interest and background to biological/medical applications.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mentors have the option of receiving 2 P/NP units, and this also looks great on Med/Grad school apps, NSF, and other grants or scholarships!\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please come out to our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2021MentorInfosession\">virtual mentor info session</a> on NEXT FRIDAY, Feb. 5th from 6:00-7:00pm to learn more about this amazing opportunity.
