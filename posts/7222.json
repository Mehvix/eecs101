Like get up today, do 1/4 of the course, then another quarter, and thus on for four days. Then ask yourself if you can recall every single thing taught in the course. Every sort of nitty gritty formula, and its applications, and all the other tricky little details. These EECS tests can literally be studied for exactly the same as every sort of humanities/bio course, just keep track of all the things you need to keep track of, then continuously and daily form a very natural language about the material. I&#39;m no academic superstar, but logically you need to answer each question from the finals, and typically they&#39;ll derive very naturally from the course material [though of course, being the summer, you&#39;ll get a finals with questions that appear initially lion-like and with little applicability to the course you just took]. All that you thereby need is a logical and semantic framework by which you will process questions. Keep improving the very structure of how you recall things -- maybe make a mental tree, sorting the course into weeks, then into lectures and then specific details about each lecture and accompanied questions. Then try and break all that, and build a level of natural robusticity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know that sounds unbelievably lame, and that you are a young able bodied person in a wonderously cool part of the country. All I can say is that beyond eating, drinking, and sometimes sleeping, there is very little in this world that you absolutely have to do at all, and yet I&#39;m likewise absolutely positive that you find some things very natural and positive, and likewise, you can feel those exact feelings about any given course. To take from the old adage &#34;The key to hapiness is thinking happy thoughts&#34;. Follow my stead -- think happy thoughts about yourself and your courses. Wake up with confidence in yourself and in what you&#39;re doing, and with that totality you can find deep strength.
