Also, sleep, eat well, and exercise daily to keep up your energy and positive morale.\n\nidk much about ee120. You can always search for a tech elective that&#39;s light. Data 100 is the best choice for balanced workload.\n\nI&#39;ve heard 1/2 people say 188 is a lot of work, and 1/2 say it&#39;s chill. There&#39;s a lot of reasons people complain about classes hah, so I can&#39;t really say if 188 would be a good 3rd tech. My friends who obsess over ML say 188 is a great class, while my other friends said it&#39;s worthless.\n\nMixed with personal experience and friend opinions: 162, 189, EECS 127/126, 170, 186(Hellerstein), 161, 168 are my personal recommendation courses, and I put them in order of difficulty/work. 160, 164, 169, 17x, 184, 188 imo are not necessary unless that class is your focus. 169 could be a great class if you take with Fox and you didn&#39;t learn the material via an internship.\n\nIn the end, all of these courses are a lot of work, so if you plan on taking 3 per semester, please make a priority to sleep the same time every night and get at least 7 hours. Also, hit the gym at least 20 minutes and eat as healthy as your budget lets you.

Self study the material. If you have time and space, it&#39;s a fun class to take.\n\nWorkload:\nIt&#39;s a great 3rd tech(Although 3 techs is never great). In terms of workload, there&#39;s 6 hws, 2 projects. You can drop 1 hw. If you drop the 6th hw, the only work from Spring Break until dead week is proj 2. Hws can take 1 hour if you know the material well, or 10-20 if you&#39;re stuck on multiple problems. With that being said, hw is very light. Proj is basically 1.5-2 hws in terms of length. The 1 midterm and 1 final were basically multiple choice, and if you learn more in depth than lecture notes(ie don&#39;t just memorize definitions and basic problems), you&#39;ll probably get a good grade. Also lab every week, takes an hour to complete and there&#39;s a TA there to help. You can also do the labs on your own.\n\nMaterial:\nFrom Jan all the way until late February, we learned pandas(python library to work with data), ways to create good visualizations, extract, clean, and manipulate data. I would imagine this being a great skill to learn if you want to work in data. Pandas is apparently heavily used in industry.\n\nAlong the way you learn very basic probability, SQL, and regex. I took 186, which I think helps you learn SQL better than data 100.\n\nFrom March until end, you basically learn intro the ML, which was awesome since I knew basically nothing about it. The material was very difficult for me, but I didn&#39;t put as much effort in hindsight.\n\nMy friends perspective(Taken: EECS 127, ML research):\nMy friend knew Pandas, and the ML library we used. Also, EECS 127 goes in extreme depth of the 2nd half material. He said the class didn&#39;t teach ML well, and that it wasn&#39;t worth it.\n\nLet me know if this long explanation is unclear.
