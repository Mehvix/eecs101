How do the classes above look like for next semester? I was advised not to take math 54 in place of 7B since both CS70 and 16A/B are as good as taking 54. But my concern is that I won&#39;t be able to truly learn from these classes (especially cs70) given this workload. I&#39;m having a rough time right now with 7A, 16A, 61C, mainly because all of my assignments/homeworks are due the same day. I heard 7B is less intense than 7A, but that 16B was harder than 16A given the project debugging.</p>\n<p>So should I stay with 7B or switch to 54 to have more time for 70?
