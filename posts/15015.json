One is that 159 has to spend time teaching neural networks and embeddings and stuff where as in 288, it is brushed over as a prerequisite. Due to this, I would say that 288 has more time to spend on each topic. The big topics that it covers are Language modeling, machine translation, speech (ASR and generation), Parsing, Semantics, and then some shorter potpourri (grounding, NLU, language reconstruction, etc.. Looking at the lectures of 159, 288 definitely skims over some of the 159 material in favor of teaching practical pitfalls and solutions that one encounters in NLP. I would say it covers more material and goes really in depth on the algorithms and practical considerations compared to 159, in addition to a huge module dedicated to speech that 159 doesn't have.

You already took Info 159 and this will give you a broader spectrum about modern NLP. While it is meant to train researchers, you can definitely just take the course to listen to awesome lectures (10/10 lectures from Klein and Denero). The work is IMO not as hard as some people say, and taking the class makes NLP seem not as daunting as it is. Taking Info 159 will make the class easier I would also expect. There is no homework or exams, just projects on colab (with piazza and office hours for help). The reason why I put it here is that if you ever do have to work on NLP in industry, taking this class can be a huge boost because you have already been exposed to all of these concepts and you don't need to learn a bunch of modern NLP. For enrollment, see @14857 for details, but in essence, as long as the class doesn't fill up the room physically, the prof has no trouble allowing anyone who finishes Project 0 to enroll. I would recommend anyone to attend a couple of classes and attempt Project 0. If it is too much and you want to chill, you don't even need to drop the class because you weren't enrolled anyways. </md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji4zyrg94hv49t", "name": "Yasoob Khalid Niazi", "photo": "1530981380_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ji4zyrg94hv49t/1530981380_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "ji4zyrg94hv49t", "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g", "updated": "2021-04-30T06:01:37Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 4/25 - 5/1", "bucket_order": 36, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/25 - 5/1", "bucket_order": 36, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-30T15:54:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ko4hxws2wot7d", "subject": "<p>Thanks for your detailed response!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS 184: Hmm, I might take it to get some hands on experience in C&#43;&#43; since it&#39;s very relevant for industry like you mentioned.

I&#39;m curious though, you mention it has some overlap with 61c and 162 but both of them cover such a wide range of topics, I&#39;m wondering which subfields does it overlap with? Is the micro-controller stuff that you mentioned similar to 16B where we program the car&#39;s TI microprocessor (I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m really far off! I&#39;m a complete noob at hardware haha) since didn&#39;t really enjoy that much (didn&#39;t really enjoy 16B at all tbh but that might just be the way it&#39;s taught).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EECS 151: Hmm, can you elaborate a bit on what &#39;touching the digital design space&#39; means? Is it similar to designing chips and processors (kind of like what we do with Logisim where we design the datapath?)

I feel it really aligns with my goals since you mention that it teaches the foundational material for EE so for someone like me who doesn&#39;t intend to really explore the hardware side deeply but wants to make sure I&#39;m well-informed and &#34;well-rounded&#34; this seems a good way to learn about the field as a whole in a low-effort manner.

How would you compare it&#39;s workload with some of the CS classes I mentioned above?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EECS 106A: Robotics sounds really cool but not sure if I&#39;ll be able to pull through the class haha! I seem to have the LA and Calc background they require, but as someone who hasn&#39;t taken a physics class since high school (L&amp;S CS) would I satisfy that prereq that they list? If not, what&#39;s the minimum physics background you recommend I go in with? Also, curious to know how it falls on the hardware/software divide?

Digital design is basically writing HDL language code (Verilog) for hardware to work with different input signals or values (e.g. implementing an FSM on hardware). Yes, it is similar to designing chips and processors in the Logism projects. The logism project is exactly what you&#39;ll be doing for the incredibly hard final project in this class (this is why the class is 5 units -- 3 units for lecture and 2 units for lab) as you&#39;ll now be writing code in Verilog to implement a 3-stage pipeline RISC-V datapath and program it on the FPGA. So instead of wires and logic gates built in for you in Logism, you&#39;ll have to write code yourself that does that and connect different modules and debug it with waveforms. An FPGA, at a high level, is a reprogrammable chip that you can write code and interface with a lot of different things. It is typically used in Verification as you can imagine, you can write code that test taped out chips here and there without having to invest in a custom made software/hardware to interface with your taped-out chip. Admittedly, since FPGA runs at a very high speed (200 Mhz clock on some of them), it is often used in trading/finance to make decisions.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Bonus: </em>Hardware companies actually love this class. When I took it, Apple, Cisco, Qualcomm, etc were like directly recruiting from a class of 80 students in 151. Your chances of getting noticed at career fair also increases 100x with just this class on your resume.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>120:</strong> It is foundational material for EE but actually has plenty of uses in the CS side as well for computational photography which you&#39;ve taken. 120 really makes you understand the subtle relationship between Time-Frequency via the Fourier Transform and LTI systems in general. It is both offered in Fall and Spring but if you&#39;re not in a rush, you can take it with Babak in Spring22 as he is a GOAT professor who usually teaches this class. His lectures are amazing and I think its worth to take it with him. The workload is generally very light when I took it with him -- 6-7 Homeworks with 4-5 Jupyter notebook labs and 3 midterms (no final). This class leads to the field of digital signal processing, which has incredible use in ML/AI if you&#39;re ever going into that field at all when designing filters and what not.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a motivation -- Shazam (the music recognition app) uses Fourier Transform to match the song with its database. So theres definitely incredible applications with Fourier Transform in general.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>106A: </strong>You don&#39;t need any knowledge apart from Math 54 and 16B to do well in this class. There isn&#39;t realy any physics apart from basic dynamics which is just F = ma as this class is definitely more linear algebra heavy. This class sort of falls into the software side since it is more focused on controls on the robot (P/PID controller) BUT in your final project (which replaces the final and worth 40%), you may choose to do it in hardware and show off your robot and what not. You don&#39;t have to build a robot physically yourself as it is up to you, but I chose to do a hardware project where my team built a chess-playing robot using servos and 3D cadded bases and chess pieces with imaging with the Rasp Pi camera. Some other teams did it based purely on simulation and still did very well. <strong>Bonus:</strong> This class doesn&#39;t follow the EECS curve -- it has a 3.7 class average. 106B has a 3.9 class average.

I think basic OS concepts are mentioned in the textbook and covered in the HW as well, but you will find that 149 has a slight overlap with like almost every EECS course lol.

In fact for the class last semesters, they shipped us all essentially a <a href=\"https://www.pololu.com/product/4022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more advanced launchpad kit</a>. So 149 lab had very very minimal circuits (we just had to connect some wires from pins on the nrf52 to a device with wires, and needed to just have some level of understanding of floating inputs and why they are bad); instead, the lab was focused on enabling the use of sensors and actuators from a micro controller using like only C programming, basically implementing libraries at a basic level that let you do this with a simple function call on an Arduino, and then once you have command of sensors and actuators you get your robot to accomplish a basic task like driving in a square formation, going up a ramp and back down without falling off, etc. You can get a feel for the lab content by looking at the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3hnYwv3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lab textbook</a>, although this may change for an in-person semester.</p>\n<p></p>\n</li><li><strong>106A: </strong>@Gear did an nice job, want to just mention a few things. 106A lab was done entirely in simulation last semester, but next semester we are planning to do things in person, which will give you experience playing with real robots. But as mentioned, 106A isn&#39;t really a hardware/mechanical design class for robots, that falls closer to 192. Instead, 106A kind of takes the approach of assume your robot is already built and has a nice Python interface, now what? and teaches you things you can do at that point. 149 is more like the skills to build up to that Python interface. We like to say that the only prereqs are freshman level linear algebra and freshman level python programming - we try to keep the class accessible to people of many diverse backgrounds, and I think that&#39;s something which makes the course pretty wonderful. </li></ul>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji4zyrg94hv49t", "name": "Yasoob Khalid Niazi", "photo": "1530981380_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ji4zyrg94hv49t/1530981380_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdt6eb1uw3c578", "name": "Thanh Tran", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ji4zyrg94hv49t", "kdt6eb1uw3c578", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "updated": "2021-05-01T17:22:57Z"}], "config": {"editor": "md"}, "created": "2021-04-30T09:58:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ko458eeb3rh6d6", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<md>Nick's suggestions are excellent; here are mine:\n\n- CS 184: I know you don't like theory heavy, but I heard this class is heavy on the programming side anyway.

Plus knowing how to do FPGA things is super employable ATM, with companies like Apple watching out for this course in particular.\n\n- EE 120: Relatively light, chill class that teaches really foundational material for anything in EE, so if you want to understand what someone is talking about when they mention linear systems or work on any product that interacts the physical world in some way, I would recommend.\n\n- EE 192: If you think 149 is interesting but want to do something even closer to the hardware and pick up some mechanical design skills, this class would be for you. Only taught spring.\n\n- EECS 106A: Last but not least, robotics is a growing field that you may find interesting and want to take a part in. It's an excellent course that has a math heavy lecture but pretty fun labs and a final project which could be a good capstone experience. I'm not biased in any way ;) Only taught fall.\n\nAlso don't let the A+ stuff discourage you from taking grad classes. Enrollment polices really depend on who is teaching, so if there is some class that seems interesting to you and you want to take it, demonstrating your passion to the instructor should be enough.
