Vazirani used an ipad, but I think the slides were posted on piazza or something - not the website. That said, as others have recommended, the textbook is definitely the way to go (or past lectures, but they follow pretty closely to the textbook). There is one caveat, special topics towards the end. Some professors put more emphasis here than others, but generally it&#39;s primality testing, hashing, streaming, quantum computing, and multiplicative updates.
