Essentially, this<br />would allow a handful of people with mobile phones to quickly determine<br />areas of flow without expensive anemometers. This app will be open<br />source, completely free and intended as a public good. Some initial<br />groundwork and guidance exists but the main challenge is that this must<br />be working by the first week of June (!). If you have SOLID experience<br />with mobile apps, please email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:maharbiz@berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maharbiz@berkeley.edu</a>\u00a0with DOPPLER in<br />your subject line. Feel free to form small teams who can work together<br />effectively.
