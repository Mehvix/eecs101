E-liza dolls (https://www.elizadolls.com/) is a start-up working on building a doll that gets young girls into coding! \n\nWe are in need of some hardware/software help. Specifically using an adafruit Circuit playground Express (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333) and a bolted on TFT gizmo screen (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4367) hooked up to a heartbeat pulse sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1093).\n\nWe want to build a &#34;truth&#34; sensor that takes in the heartbeat pulse value and then outputs on the screen either &#34;truth&#34; or &#34;lie&#34; based on the pulse, assuming your heartbeat goes up when you lie. \n\nWe have all the hardware parts connected and its reading in the values from the sensor. We even have code working in arduino that will display what the heartbeat looks like in a neat chart like what you would see at a hospital but we want it to display the truth or lie. This is a short project for someone with the right experience and will be compensated in cash! See my forum post for the code, and code will be emailed as well. \n\nEmail Eliza at eko@berkely.edu. Parts will be dropped off/mailed.
