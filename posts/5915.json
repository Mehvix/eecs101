A cursory glance of this Piazza will demonstrate that even the most fully answered questions are repeatedly asked. If foundational questions are repeatedly asked, then non-enrolled non-TAs answering a fraction of instances of those questions will not deprive enrolled / TAs of education.</li><li>Why do you assume that questions are fully answered? Often an initial answer requires additional clarification or substantiation (such as your previous comment). If there is always room to add knowledge, then non-enrolled non-TAs incompletely answering questions would not substantially deprive enrolled / TAs of education.</li><li>Why do you assume that people are either enrolled, non-enrolled, or active TAs? Sometimes people audit classes. Should they not be able to answer questions either?</li><li>Why is answering questions a\u00a0necessary avenue for education? You repeatedly assert that answering questions helps people learn. Presumably, so does going to lecture, discussion, or lab. Why is answering questions on Piazza so necessary an avenue for education you would force non-enrolled non-TAs to leave the course Piazza (and depriving people of answers)?</li><li>Why is Piazza a necessary means of answering questions?

He was the person with the same experience and knowledge as other TAs who would reply to my question within a few minutes. He was the only reason why almost every cs70 posts were answered especially near the final when students would spam literally any question they have from past exams(he even had to deal with soo many duplicates) and keep in mind that other TAs have their finals too so most of them didn&#39;t have time to answer questions right away.\u00a0Many students still participate in discussions and you are welcome to participate even in his presence. In fact, by your reasoning, why would we even need TAs in our piazza page? But I guess I do see some drawback with Steven&#39;s presence. He probably raises many exam means significantly just because of the sole amount of questions he had answered and corrected (disadvantageous because things you have spent so much time to understand are explained by him so simply and so clearly to everyone else in the class). Just check out the posts on cs70 notes. He would answer every question any student has, although I do have to acknowledge that due to his tremendous experience, his responses can sometimes make us feel diminished but I&#39;m okay with that as it can be annoying at times to have to explain basic concepts that we should have learned on our own.
