The more difficult part is learning good design and human computer interaction ideas, but perhaps you can find course notes or read up on this in some other way, then just complete your own projects and build a personal portfolio. None of this is a great subsititute for the teamwork experience and you wont get immediate feedback the way you could if you took 160, but there are other ways to develop these skills.
