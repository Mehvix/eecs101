The world of EECS is very broad, and is singularly defined by hardworking imaginative people. Bluntly, if your goal is to work at a hedge fund and make bank, that&#39;s incredibly suboptimal decision planning [given that very few people survive the industry in a remotely profitable way, you&#39;d make more money in literally any other career when you look at the hours put in, including service and consulting work, and that fundamentally, the kind of\u00a0entities that invest in hedge funds and private equity are rarely friendly institutions and more commonly extreme criminals and destructive individuals that can&#39;t get their money clean elsewhere]. Consider what EECS can offer you at a higher level. Skip out on BS &#39;learn to handshake&#39; Haas courses, and instead work with honorable folks, like Miki Lustig, who tirelessly develops revolutionary medical technologies from novel MRI detection systems to bio-printed medical devices, or Ken Goldberg, whose AutoLab designs autonomous robotics for all kinds of necessary tasks, like Phillipine disaster relief, making beds for the disabled and developing surgery robotics, among soooooooo many others. In fact, look through the work at these labs:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/Centers/\">https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/Centers/</a>. Ask yourself about the kind of person you really want to be, separate of anything except what your core capabilities are, and I think you&#39;ll identify a lot with these people. Moreover, Berkeley teaches that all existing systems are human and fallible. If you push yourself in EECS, take high level and grad courses, rigorously engage with the amazing, energetic community, you&#39;ll get so much money it&#39;ll make your eyes bleed. Someone working on self-driving cars, or ML at Google out of college, is making at least 250k a year fresh out, and that&#39;s just the starting point. Tons of professors here have commercialized ground breaking work and made millions, if not billions, and they return to the university because they want to do more and give back to the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In summary, I wish I had known this when I was younger, and was less arrogant and hard-headed. In fact, I still have the google doc on how I was going to finish in 2 years and get a PhD and make bank at a Renaissance Technologies or similar hedge fund. Please believe me when I tell you the guidelines made by Professor Anant Sahai and Co. are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo well thought out, that they are there for your true help guidance and development. Literally read Sahai&#39;s posts here and on his faculty site, or meet with him and several other faculty in person, and I think you&#39;ll see that if you open yourself up to this material deeply, not just hitting out pre-reqs to collect a degree, but really and creatively think about this stuff, you will be rewarded in a way few people alive have ever experienced.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-12-30T23:44:59Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-02T17:20:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>For a CoE major (EECS) &#34;You must complete a minimum of 5 upper division technical courses distinct to each major (e.g. 5 classes beyond any that overlap).&#34;\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/simultaneous-degrees</strong></p>", "created": "2019-01-02T17:20:52Z", "subject": "", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "jqfg70apm3m7n4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/30 - 1/5", "bucket_order": 104, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-02T18:05:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jqfhsgyembk6cc", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>&#64;nicole How does that relate to l and s majors, where the rule is completely different?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-01-02T18:05:33Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-12-30T03:14:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "lscs", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=attach%2Fhyq0br1u3kx7dg%2Fj4f6z772zscwl%2Fjqaba8matyqz%2Ftm1.JPG\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=attach%2Fhyq0br1u3kx7dg%2Fj4f6z772zscwl%2Fjqabaphuew38%2Ftm2.JPG\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hi,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am currently in my sophomore year and was confused on the rules between overlapping majors between l and s and other majors.
