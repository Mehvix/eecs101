But CS 161 does a tutorial on this anyway so you&#39;ll have a chance to get refreshed/caught up. Plus, CS 161 uses x86, so it doesn&#39;t draw directly on CS 61C. Everyone, including those who did well in CS 61C, will have to pick this up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS 162 is a little more problematic. It draws heavily on concepts from CS 61C, most notably C programming, memory layout, caches, virtual memory, and to a small extent even ISA/processor design (regarding how interrupts are designed/implemented). That said, I agree with the above answer that doing poorly in CS 61C doesn&#39;t necessarily imply you&#39;ll do poorly in this class. You should try to understand why you did poorly in CS 61C.
