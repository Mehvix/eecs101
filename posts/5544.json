Great on you for encouraging people to subvert their academic goals in order to game a flawed system.

Given your waitlist position you will very likely get in. The admins won&#39;t explicitly say you will get in bc they can&#39;t make you promises. Also, you are right, the priority doesn&#39;t make sense. The logic is that undeclared L&amp;S can potentially declare CS but imo it&#39;s flawed reasoning bc Math needs 61B for a CS\u00a0concentration (which is part of the major). <br /><br />As an EECS major\u00a0I have run into similar strange priorities. This semester in EE16a 75 seats are saved for EECS majors of all years and 325 seats are saved for L&amp;S Undeclared majors all years. Electrical Engineering is in EECS&#39;s names.

None of your understanding to my words is correct. Which sentence above encourages people to subvert their academic goals? Any student willing to declare has the responsibility to plan their prospective coursework ahead instead of complaining the system after he/she fails to declare (or even graduate). You think this system is flawed then I wonder what is a perfect system in your mind? Which sentence above do you feel I&#39;m implying some majors are more deserving than the others? What I don&#39;t agree is that some students willing to declare some majors apply for another major with much higher admit rate and eventually they declare the original major they are interested in. Although I cannot agree with such strategies, I am not complaining the admission system is unfair because all the admission information is open to everyone and posted online. Well-prepared applicants should be able to understand such situation before they make the best decisions for themselves.</p>\n<p>Back to the enrollment, math department and EECS are two separate departments. It&#39;s not EECS department&#39;s responsibility to reserve the seats for students from other majors just because they elect to take EE/CS classes as their electives or concentration. The department is kind enough to keep expending the lower division CS classes each semester so that most of the students without enrollment priority can eventually have the spots (if they waitlist themselves early). There is no perfect enrollment policy to make it completely fair to everyone. What the department does is to work hard and try to help everyone willing to take CS classes to be able to enroll. There are not many departments offering advising appointments on CalCentral to all Cal students and also they adjust the enrollment priority every year in order to make it as fair as possible. Also, again, all the EECS enrollment policies are posted (and updated frequently) on either department website or the EECS 101 forum so that all students may plan ahead for having the best chance to enroll.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-11-13T05:04:13Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-11-11T06:17:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j9uxvw54j9n21j", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>So even though I am a transfer student, I cannot have priority to choose 61B?
