Below\u00a0are some pros/cons I&#39;d\u00a0mention.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Pros:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Income:</strong> The income is really helpful. I can live fairly comfortably and save a decent\u00a0amount to\u00a0use in future semesters.</p>\n<p><strong>Stress:</strong> Taking some time away from Cal has been a really great de-stresser. I feel very rested and ready to kill it in the Fall!</p>\n<p><strong>Work Experience:</strong> Like any internship I&#39;ve gotten a ton of professional experience. Even more than a summer internship (a semester is a month longer than a summer).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Cons:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Withdrawing:</strong>\u00a0In order to do this you have to formally withdraw from Cal. It&#39;s not as big of a deal as it sounds, but there&#39;s a decent amount of paperwork you have to sort through to withdraw and be readmitted. Time it correctly to register for your Spring classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Housing</strong>: Depending on where you are interning, it can be difficult to find good housing for ~4 months. I&#39;ve had some success with AirBnB. You could get an apartment but short term leases\u00a0are expensive and you might have to find your own furniture.</p>\n<p><strong>Course Planning:</strong>\u00a0I got thrown off a little bit in terms of my academic plans, specifically with courses taught only in Spring / Fall. Plan your future semesters carefully before you commit.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Life:\u00a0</strong>Depending on where you intern, you probably won&#39;t see much of your friends\u00a0from Cal, and there probably won&#39;t be other interns like there are in the summer. You also do not get long breaks to visit family as you would during a typical semester.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, whether it&#39;s a good idea or not is going to depend a lot on your specific situation. For me, I&#39;m really happy I did this!
