I didn&#39;t take Data 8 but had taken Stat 133 before I took Data 100. From my perspective Data 100 is easier than CS 61A. I have lots of friends who took Data 8 and they all said Data 8 is very easy and it is easier than some breadth, so I recommend you to keep it. CS 61B with Hilfinger has high workload and you have to finish all projects on your own, which is harder than CS 61A for sure. If you are a good programmer, then CS 61B is not too bad. The lab of EECS 16B is time-consuming but you can choose no lab option. EECS 16B is conceptually harder than EECS 16A. If you take CS 61A and EECS 16A with no other technicals and did not feel great, then from my perspective you&#39;d better take CS 61B and EECS 16B in different semesters. You don&#39;t necessarily need 16 series for CS 70. 16 series helps you build math maturity, but if you have a strong math background or have taken introduction to mathematical thinking decal, then you should be fine.</p>", "created": "2020-01-22T04:17:08Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k5osq3e3f1i6b0", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jycboq1nm0e6ya", "name": "Uma Karki", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jycboq1nm0e6ya"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10332": 5, "10502": 7, "10664": 0, "4505": 2, "5601": 1, "5769": 4, "5770": 3, "8372": 8, "9963": 6}}, "created": "2020-01-22T02:55:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi Everyone, For those of you that have taken all these classes how was your experiences.
