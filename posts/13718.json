CS 170 took me about ~6-8 hours a week doing homework as well. In contrast, in my experience, 126 and 127 had about 10-12 hours of homework a week. When I took these classes you did not need to complete all the homework but not doing so put you at a direct disadvantage when it came to exams, so I tried to. CS 189 has been absolutely brutal at easily 20&#43; hours spent on homework each week. In general, these more math-y CS classes seem to give a lot more work than both pure CS and pure Math classes. My friends who have taken Data 100, Stat 134, and Math 110 put them at about the same level as CS 170.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2020-11-18T18:29:34Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 11/22 - 11/28", "bucket_order": 10, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-24T03:46:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "khvft9dhlj76dy", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "I have taken all 61s, 16s, 188, 126 170 and 100.

I think its an important distinction to make, because if you look at the homeworks for fa20 and sp20, you can see a drastic difference in average lengths of the homeworks. I also think that shewchucks spring iteration gives you two weeks to do homeworks that have similar or lower length than falls, which can have upwards of 10&#43; questions with coding portions that are given to do in a week (RIP).Take this analysis with a grain of salt (I havent taken 189 yet), and I would also advise you to look at the sp20 and fa20 189 websites and briefly browse through the homeworks to see which version you would rather take.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_5", "updated": "2020-11-24T03:46:32Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10837": 4, "11656": 0, "11911": 6, "12584": 8, "13308": 2, "3711": 3, "4868": 1, "5272": 7, "7414": 5, "8987": 9}}, "created": "2020-11-17T20:35:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "eecs", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am wondering if anyone can compare the workload of upper-division courses in ML/optimization direction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such as: EECS 126, EECS 127, CS189, EECS 227B, EECS 227C, Data100 (call it List A)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have taken CS170, CS188, all CS61X, Math 104, Math 110, Stats 134, and Stats 135, (Call it List B)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Could you compare any the difficulty and workload of any of the courses in List A to any of the courses in List B?</p>", "created": "2020-11-17T20:53:24Z", "subject": "Workload of upper div courses", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am wondering if anyone can compare the workload of upper-division courses in ML/optimization direction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such as: EECS 126, EECS 127, CS189, EECS 227B, EECS 227C, Data100 (call it List A)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have taken CS170, CS188, all CS61X, Math 104, Math 110, Stats 134, and Stats 135, (Call it List B)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Could you compare any the difficulty and workload of any of the courses in List A to any of the courses in List B?</p>", "created": "2020-11-17T20:35:59Z", "subject": "Workload of upper div courses", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 2, "i_edits": [], "id": "khmfsgu18341rp", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 13718, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541915866, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jgpxnxcksnw2pl", "name": "Michael Jayasuriya", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k8gqq79bey01ts", "name": "Jerry Pan", "photo": "1594861112_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/k8gqq79bey01ts/1594861112_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhconvx95xk", "name": "Zehao Zhao", "photo": "1544304514_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhconvx95xk/1544304514_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jgpxnxcksnw2pl", "k8gqq79bey01ts", "jktvhconvx95xk"], "tags": ["other", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 463}
