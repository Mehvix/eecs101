I only really wanted to learn about the biological and computational sides of the brain. I already took cogsci 1, am taking mcb 61 and plan to take cogsci 100(the cognitive neuroscience course). These are the bio related courses of the cog sci major. As for the computational side, I&#39;m already taking those via CS like cs 188. So i was wondering whether it would be a better idea to double in CS and data sci with an emphasis on cognition because then I would be focusing on only the courses that interest me(neuroscience, ML, and cs).

Is it even worth to double in CS and data sci since they are pretty much the same thing?\nAny advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Thank You!", "created": "2021-04-14T04:30:12Z", "subject": "advice on choosing 2nd major", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kngygizvhfb2hs", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 14719, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654540803005, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1603740009}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdzjqzylq2a5gx", "name": "Roshan Regula", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kdzjqzylq2a5gx"], "tags": ["other", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 377}
