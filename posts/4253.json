Personally, the &#34;maturity&#34; means more of a way of thinking than any specific knowledge. It&#39;s almost never enough just to understand the theorems and results stated in the notes. You need to know how to use them, how to apply them in one context or another, and that&#39;s where the &#34;maturity&#34; comes from.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for Stats classes, I&#39;d say that basic knowledges about probability does help with some part of CS70, though the probability part of CS70 isn&#39;t really easy (esp. the last few lectures).
