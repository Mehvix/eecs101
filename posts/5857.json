In particular, the material from EE16AB is very important as is vector calculus. Your understanding of probability is also worth strengthening. Finally, optimization thinking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trying to prepare for a course by reading ahead in the notes is generally only a good idea after you have already made sure your prerequisite knowledge and skills are sound. Otherwise, the bang for the buck in solidifying prerequisites is far higher than reading notes. This is because you have access to far more powerful tools in solidifying prerequisites (i.e. doing problems and making problems of your own and solving them) than you do with material that you have not seen in a curated fashion. So, for example, you&#39;re going to learn more by making your own 16B problem involving the SVD, PCA, and k-means than you are going to learn by reading notes for 189. You will learn even more if you try to cross-train and interlink courses like 126, 16A, and 16B for yourself. Now that you have the tools of probability, explore for yourself why you think that the correlation-maximization approach that you pursued in 16A for localization works. When will it stop working? How much noise will break it? Why? Look at the PCA approach from 16B and connect it to what you now know about covariances. The possibilities are endless. The lower-division and entry-level upper-division courses are filled with open-ended things ripe for fertile connections. Play with Jupyter notebooks if you are someone who works better with experimentation. Almost anything is better than just reading.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Think of it this way. If someone asked you whether you should prepare for learning to ski by\u00a0reading skiing notes or by doing squats, yoga, and cardio, which is better preparation? Reading about skiing might seem to be closer than skiing, but when you&#39;re on the slopes, it is the squats that will help you. Of course, if you&#39;re already super fit, then by all means, throw in some ski-book reading. Alongside working out on things that you already know how to do in good form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re a slow learner as you describe yourself, you have to ask yourself &#34;why?&#34; In the vast majority of cases, underlying holes in background present as slowness in learning. This is because you don&#39;t have mental familiarity with the analogies that are used to make ideas hang together. So it seems to take longer. If a student has a rock solid understanding of say 16AB, 126 and 127, each lecture in 189 is basically going to bring in at most 1 or 2 new ideas. Sometimes even less.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course in some cases, people simply have a miscalibrated sense of what &#34;slow&#34; means. In an EECS course, spending 20 hours per week from time to time to get the material properly is not being slow. It is just normal.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-12-29T06:46:48Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jbrk29efyah4by", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1525153666, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1527030308, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1525109355, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1539234857}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9v8jj8x141", "name": "Mohammed Shaikh", "photo": "1515230849_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9v8jj8x141/1515230849_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j52tuayf2uf7om", "name": "Dev Ojha", "photo": "1504021332_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j52tuayf2uf7om/1504021332_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "hv1txxy8ydl116": 1, "hy2kng98yfh4lv": 1, "i572jokpces6w1": 1, "irwl7o7shzu70z": 1, "is6ct9fu4hh7b5": 1, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1525110988, "jil7sindo8q4to": 1530505356}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzem9zn8zpm2nm", "name": "Sameer Khanna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7b2ohah61j", "name": "Graham", "photo": "1476155638_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p7b2ohah61j/1476155638_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzab6kpr3c048h", "name": "Justin Luke", "photo": "1473540382_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzab6kpr3c048h/1473540382_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j51gxcqxjxc1zy", "name": "Ganeshkumar Ashokavardhanan", "photo": "1527237927_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j51gxcqxjxc1zy/1527237927_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "id1uo21mill1sl", "name": "Simin Liu", "photo": "1485491287_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/id1uo21mill1sl/1485491287_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is1tqojymxn3b5", "name": "Hitesh Yalamanchili", "photo": "1527103974_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is1tqojymxn3b5/1527103974_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrzp5k98c4rt", "name": "Brandon Hsieh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz5sguer69yg4", "name": "Richard Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100005394402714", "id": "hktwxo5q8h547h", "name": "Max Kanwal", "photo": "1523295706_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktwxo5q8h547h/1523295706_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijj5yg5vj6q472", "name": "Raymond Clubb", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p9v8jj8x141", "j52tuayf2uf7om", "hzem9zn8zpm2nm", "is6p7b2ohah61j", "hzab6kpr3c048h", "j51gxcqxjxc1zy", "id1uo21mill1sl", "is1tqojymxn3b5", "j3nrzp5k98c4rt", "hz5sguer69yg4", "hktwxo5q8h547h", "ijj5yg5vj6q472"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/24 - 12/30", "bucket_order": 117, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-29T07:25:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jbrlfxfkkvh5ui", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thank you professor!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "hzem9zn8zpm2nm", "updated": "2017-12-29T07:25:25Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/24 - 12/30", "bucket_order": 117, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/24 - 12/30", "bucket_order": 117, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-29T11:48:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jbruugehusweu", "subject": "&#43;1 same experience as 189 student in the past semester.
