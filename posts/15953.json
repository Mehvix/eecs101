The other course is a Breath Course, which is less important than the Data 8 class. My plan is to enroll into the Breath Course over phase 2 but I am worried there won&#39;t be seats open, so I was thinking about swapping it with the Data 8 class for now. But I need Data 8 for my major and need to take it next semester however, there are 1100 seats reserved for freshmen and sophomores in the class. The question I have now is- should I enroll into the smaller course since there is a lot of seats open for the Data 8 class? What are my chances of getting into the Data 8 course by the next phase?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2021-10-21T16:22:20Z", "subject": "Should I enroll into Data 8 now or wait until phase 2?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kv15k6o7agz6je", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 15953, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539446958, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "other", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 185}
