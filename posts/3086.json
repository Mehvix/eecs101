Seriously, nearly anything you need will be on this site. Even if front-end work doesn&#39;t interest you, I still recommend you learn the basics of styling and presenting information onto a screen so your future projects look more impressive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once your feet are wet, you can move into back end by choosing a framework. There are many: Flask, Django, Ruby, etc., but really the framework doesn&#39;t matter too much. If you want to keep things straightforward, I suggest Flask or Django (as they are Python based, but the other languages aren&#39;t too difficult to pick up). I began first with Django, a Python web framework. There&#39;s the official Django tutorial, but there&#39;s the also Django Girls tutorial (which I preferred): both of these will get you on the right track in terms of how information is stored, manipulated, and passed along the framework, as well as other useful information like templating and all. If you choose Flask or Ruby or Node or something else, just know that there are just as many tutorials and resources available via Youtube (and I&#39;m sure you can ask friends or reddit or anyone on the Berkeley CS / EECS group).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve completed the tutorial(s), if you still feel uncomfortable with the frameworks, I&#39;d suggest to take a mini-project that you&#39;ve done through the tutorial and make marginal changes to it (see if you can make a survey app, for instance, show how many people on your site voted &#34;Yes&#34; versus &#34;No&#34; after a user votes). Or, you can simply start a new project and work through it slowly, understanding the framework and the uses as you go along.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was kinda Django-centric, but feel free to ask any questions!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "idrimp3e9tl5o1", "updated": "2017-01-10T08:43:45Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-10T07:04:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixr69f5yv5q52h", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>It would be helpful to list out what you&#39;ve done in CS so far in terms of classes and any non-class projects you&#39;ve worked on.
