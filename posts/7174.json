The class focused more on non-programmatic topics such as useability heuristics and design aesthetics. The majority of our assignments were written, and many of the projects you see were written more with an eye to interface design versus actual functionality. I found it to be a very manageable course. That being said, I would use Paulos\u2019 website as the course is apparently very different normally. I thought it was a great class and super manageable, but I know opinion varied.\u00a0", "created": "2018-06-18T19:23:19Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jikndtjkg8c5pc", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iscem14kbsu5vi"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-17T22:10:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I was looking through the CS 160 Fall 2017 showcase and was shocked by what was being shown.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How difficult is the course, and are we generally expected to make full-blown applications such as what is in the showcase?
