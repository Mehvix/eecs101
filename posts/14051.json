You don&#39;t have to stress too much about getting the classes exactly right. I guessed that I would take a special topics 290 class and was right, but also put down a class that ended up not being offered. Of the 6 classes I originally wrote, I changed 3, took 2, and dropped 1. Just make your best estimation of what you would probably take.\n\n2) This varies person to person. I had a pretty good idea of the types of classes I wanted to take, so I didn&#39;t need advice from anyone. My advisor wasn&#39;t really involved in the decision process (also I haven&#39;t heard of an advisor *requiring* you to take a class). I assume most advisors have the attitude of &#34;do whatever you want/think is best for your industry future&#34;, but you&#39;re welcome to ask them if you think their advice is relevant.\n\n3) No! In fact, you&#39;re required to take 8-10 breadth units (though I guess these can be &#34;technical&#34;; for example, Math classes are a breadth, but not EECS ones. It is certainly not a requirement to make your breadths technical though). Make sure you read the Masters requirements carefully. It matters much more for your graduation than for this draft course sheet. I took/am going to take two language classes that will satisfy my breadth requirements, and I noted those in my course sheet. \n\n4) Honestly, I don&#39;t know. I think they want to ensure we aren&#39;t taking random classes for no reason, but for the senior year classes, it is to prove that you are working toward a specific goal. For example, if you are interested in circuit design, it would make sense that your senior year courses also reflected that interest as you pursue it further in your masters. It would be odd to completely switch your focus/interest from senior year to your masters year, since you would kind of be starting from scratch. That said, I had to tie in my language courses with a signal processing focus, and they&#39;re really not that related to each other. \nThe &#34;relevance to research/breadth area&#34; prompt has nothing to do with backdating though. You can only backdate one course from your second semester senior year. It can technically be any 200 level EE/CS course, regardless of its relevance to your area of focus.", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6n5mygq8vw4uc", "name": "Sarah Bhaskaran", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6n5mygq8vw4uc"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-01-02T21:43:56Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10462": 5, "11855": 1, "12092": 4, "12738": 2, "13232": 0, "13961": 6, "1704": 9, "2256": 3, "7923": 7, "826": 8}}, "created": "2021-01-01T23:05:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>A few questions for filling out the Draft Course of Study:</p>\n<p>1) How can we know what classes will be available during our 5th year when many of the graduate CS courses offered are Special Topics courses that vary year to year?
