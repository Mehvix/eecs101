I don&#39;t want &#34;EE&#34; or &#34;CS&#34; people in CoE to lose their privilege of taking courses that are in the other specialization.That&#39;s why both names, ECE and CSE, have &#34;computer&#34; and &#34;engineering&#34; in them.\u00a0This is not a radical idea, considering basically every other UC school does it.\u00a0It would be a simple formalization of the currently symbolic choice EECS students already have to make between the two concentrations. Simply put, if the two were nominally separate, admissions would be a lot simpler. My rationale is that Cal is not able to admit as many intended-EE students because EECS is the only major for EE students, and this is reflected in the relatively smaller number of students who take core EE classes compared to other schools of similar stature. It was difficult for me to get concrete data on graduating seniors in ECE, but the best fit for me was looking at enrollment in EE 105 and mapping that over 8 semesters of undergraduates. Obviously, EE is not just circuits, but, as was pointed out, enrollment in other core EE classes like EE 120 includes students who are &#34;double-dipping&#34; (as they should) but will eventually become CSE or CS. Currently, EE 105 for Fall 2017 has 37 students enrolled in it, and, although this is larger than the sub-30 number who finished the class last semester, I think it is reflective of a good approximation for half of the ECE students for one class (i.e. C/O 2019, etc). Just for the sake of argument, I&#39;ll boost the number to 60 (although the other core subset of EE, signals, is not large enough to justify this, considering EE 123 enrollment for Spring 2017 was just 12 people). I understand that there are AI/ML/Robotics, etc. but those students would likely fall under CSE, so I&#39;m not including them in this argument. Anyway, 60*8 is 480 and 480/27496 (&lt;-- total undergrad enrollment) is ~1.7%. Remember, this is a generous estimate in my opinion. Compare this to EE &#43; CE enrollment for the University of Toronto (a similar large public research institution, where I&#39;m studying for the summer, and the most convenient for me to get data on), which is 1510 and dividing by the total undergrad enrollment of 56261 yields ~2.7%. That&#39;s a whole 1% difference! 1% of 27496 is 275 students (who could be in ECE but are not because EECS)! You can run the same analysis on basically any other similar school, and I guarantee that you will see a trend. That Cal lags behind in attracting students to EE despite being the ~3rd best undergrad EE program in the WORLD is honestly pathetic. 2cents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, I feel like creating EIS for L&amp;S is an imperfect solution because the subject matter of the major means that someone in EIS really deserves a place in CoE: it&#39;s called &#34;electrical engineering&#34; for a reason. Making ECE separate in terms of admissions would ensure that everyone who wants a chance at EE when they apply to the university has a fair shot at it. And, because I feel that it won&#39;t be as severely impacted as EECS, transfers should be possible, without the need for a whole new major.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2017-07-06T21:31:36Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 7/2 - 7/8", "bucket_order": 142, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-07-06T22:14:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j4szphpbzxk3h0", "subject": "<p>Also, to respond to the anon who is advocating MIT&#39;s style of doing things, I think EECS as a major should be done away with, not as a department.

The department could keep the already different course requirements for the two (perhaps tweaking ECE so that more EE classes must be taken at the upper-div level), and I feel this would be a reasonable solution to a lot of the department&#39;s problems with regards to major selection for students.
