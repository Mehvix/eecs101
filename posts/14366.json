The consequences of that vary greatly from company to company. Based solely on my personal experience I would say smaller companies might not care too much if you renege but larger companies are more likely to blacklist you. If you ultimately decide to go back on your original offer then I suggest giving them a call (not an email!) and explaining your reasons to do so. Most recruiters/hiring managers understand that college students are still looking for their &#34;best fit&#34; in careers so hopefully it won&#39;t be too much of a stressful call!</p>", "created": "2021-01-29T23:54:43Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kkiy182sh452os", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzesjo8ohkp51j", "name": "Akhil Sachdev", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzesjo8ohkp51j"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-01T03:45:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kkm153972wf3mv", "subject": "You won&#39;t really burn bridges.
