I agree with the perspective above. Data8 is a good Combo of coding and stats. CS70 is a heavy theory class which is important for many upper division class. Interestingly, 1 or 2 of the topics in 70 are mentioned in Data8 (of course at a very basic level) like Law of Large Numbers and chebyshev\u2019s inequality and the way it\u2019s explained in Data8 actually helped intuitively understand the same concepts in 70 behind the heavy math and formulae. Pretty cool I thought but In short as the above person said, I second their opinion In that you should take 70&#43;Data8. Hope this helps!\u00a0</div><p></p>", "created": "2020-01-03T08:43:08Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jkimyuzg1rb2p6"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "I say take CS70 with Data 8, and have a somewhat difficult semester (cause cs70), but also have time to yourself.
