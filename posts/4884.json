I&#39;m not exactly sure what OP means I just see other people using it and assume it&#39;s the person who originally asked the question. Could be using it wrong. Anyway, I think the most important part about taking the practice exams is studying the material before you take it and not relying on them alone to tell you what you should study.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0I think Professor Hilfinger is very practical when he tells us that we are responsible for all the knowledge in recorded history with emphasis on this course. It&#39;s better to assume you should know everything instead of just the key points.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember to tailor your studying to your own needs. Ask yourself, do I understand (insert topic here)? If there&#39;s one bit of tug in your heart that suggests &#34;No&#34; then spend some time doing some soul searching and figure out what it is that you don&#39;t understand. Yes, I know what a linked list is. Yes, I know you can change it using pointers. But what I didn&#39;t understand was how I could set a pointer to something and change that pointer without changing the list. Then I realized I didn&#39;t know the different between p.tail = ... and p = p.tail. Small stuff like that can have a big impact on your understanding and it&#39;s up to you to dig into yourself and find those small things to correct them. After you do it a few times you&#39;ll be able to identify what you&#39;re having trouble with in just under a minute. It all starts with a serious assessment of yourself with the proper questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, stopping because I feel like I&#39;m writing too much and getting a little off topic, learn to enjoy yourself and celebrate failure. Failure two hours before an exam is stressful, but failure weeks and even days away should be exciting and you should be determined to do everything stated in the paragraph above, plus some. And if it helps, use some analogies to help your understanding. Thinking of variables as boxes is an example. It helps you remember things like how you can put a subtype in a supertype box and the otherway around with casting.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recap:</p>\n<p>Study everything</p>\n<p>Figure out what you don&#39;t know\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ask for help, only after you know exactly what you need help with (post soul search session)</p>\n<p>Write some code if you need to (Java interpreter, manipulate some pointers )</p>\n<p>Watch some YouTube videos\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make analogies</p>\n<p>Take a practice exam</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Immerse yourself in the world of Java and Data Structures!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>...go to Piazza...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helped!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2017-10-01T06:28:10Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-08-29T00:30:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j6wuwh2ng1l597", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Practice midterms, practice midterms, practice midterms.
