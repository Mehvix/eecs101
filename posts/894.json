For the vast majority of students, I highly advise\u00a0<em>against</em> attempting both 61BL and 188 during the summer due to the high load of 61BL. Both classes occur during session C, so you may find the two classes competing for your time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>61B during the regular semester is already a very heavy workload course. 61BL moves twice as fast as the semester version because the same amount of material and projects must be condensed into 8 weeks. You&#39;ll be physically in lab for at least 12 hours a week, and will additionally have work to be completed outside of class time (as well as 2-hour weekly lectures and exams to attend).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would really wish for 61BL or 188 to be your only major academic time commitment so that you have time to rest. I wouldn&#39;t want you to be stressed about school every hour of the summer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The only student that\u00a0might be able to\u00a0do both would be someone who has already taken a 61BL and/or 188-equivalent course in the past but just needs to retake it to fulfill a requirement.
