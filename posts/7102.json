I think it depends on your mathematical maturity so to speak, but given that you haven&#39;t taken 70 yet, even if you are good at math, you may not have yet been exposed to the type of math and rigor that is needed for 170 (introduced in 70). While the material builds more upon 61B material (like search, and a little bit of hashing) compared to 70 material. I think that 170 builds more upon 70 in the sense of expectation, rigor, and theoretical approach. 70 builds the foundation that you need to tackle 170. I consider myself more of a mathy person, but I found that 170 took more time than 61B but less time than 70 (but I had a solid foundation from 70).\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-05-29T22:45:19Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i10w5yv8nUg"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Based on the information you gave about yourself in this post, I&#39;d say 170\u00a0would probably be\u00a0a heavier workload for you than 61b was (assuming you&#39;re going to put in all the effort necessary to fully grasp the concepts).
