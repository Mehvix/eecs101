It was fine, but his teaching style was not great for me, so I kind of regretted doing it. I am not sure 61C would have been for me with a different prof (it is\u00a0my least favorite class at Berkeley), but for me personally his class was not all it was talked up to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n<ul><li>He is really passionate, but really busy. At the time he had one hour of office hours for all the things he was teaching/overseeing and that was just not enough. I quickly gave up on trying bc there were just so many different people who needed attention during this short spot.\u00a0</li><li>He goes very fast. He countered this by having lots of information on the slides and printing the slides to hand out at lecture. This is great if it works for how you learn best! But for me, I really need the pace of the lecture to be slow enough that I can write notes and process, otherwise I have a hard time understanding. I ended up going over the webcasts slowly with lots of pausing, but this ended up taking a lot of time, and lecture was kind of a waste of time. He was also trying to make the lectures interactive, but I was not able to take advantage of this bc I was just not able to keep up.\u00a0</li></ul>", "created": "2016-11-11T16:49:16Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I think Garcia is awesome and one of the best cs professors I had, but I don&#39;t recommend\u00a0putting your life on hold waiting until he teaches it.
