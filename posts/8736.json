Unless you haven&#39;t had any internship experience, 169 isn&#39;t that useful from what I&#39;ve heard. 188 is a fun course but if you&#39;re looking for applicability it&#39;s not that great unless you&#39;re going into something to do with AI. And if you&#39;re worried about not being prepared for 189 and don&#39;t really need it then don&#39;t take that. In my opinion, 161 was the most useful class in helping me learn how to write secure code. The concepts you learn about how easy it is to exploit systems can really help when you get to industry and need to write code for a critical piece of a company&#39;s product.
