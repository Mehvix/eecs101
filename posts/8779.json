My HTML/CSS/JavaScript chops just aren&#39;t quite up to the job! It would be fairly relaxed (no real back-end work), and it would be spread out over the next two months. There is no time commitment. It would just be us working casually on this. We could meet to work on the site whenever is convenient. Unfortunately, there is no pay, but this could still be a great resume/portfolio building opportunity. Shoot me an email or text if you are interested!
