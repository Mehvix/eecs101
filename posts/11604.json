The meetup planning group decided that given preparations for resilience in the face of COVID-19/coronavirus, we would hold the meeting remotely AND feature speakers who are working using technology to enable virtual events and courses. We have some excellent guests and topics and hope to see you (cameras on!) later this month. Sorry we do not know how to deliver &#x1f355;&#x1f355;&#x1f355;&#x1f964; remotely!<br /><br />Everyone is welcome - this is a really inclusive group! You don&#39;t have to be an expert, or already know about cloud technologies; we get together so people can learn from each other.<br /><br />HOW TO CONNECT VIA ZOOM:<br /><br />Join Zoom Meeting<br /><a href=\"https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/185863585\" target=\"__blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/185863585</a><br /><br />Find your local number:\u00a0<a href=\"https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/adbovUyBgE\" target=\"__blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/adbovUyBgE</a></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2020-03-31T00:51:36Z", "subject": "[Virtual Event] UC Berkeley Cloud Meetup 012", "uid": "jgf3o98xu7u19x"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k8f6rka0fmm7l6", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11604, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544260255, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp"], "tags": ["announcements", "enrichment_opportunities", "events", "research", "student", "workshops"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 296}
