Over break I placed a request to swap the course CS164 with CS189, which I have been on the waitlist for ever since. Apparently I was just recently enrolled in 189, but it appears I am also still enrolled in 164. I would like to drop 164 now, but want to be sure that this will not mess anything up with my enrollment in 189. Can anyone offer some advice or insight into how the system will handle such a thing?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks! :)</p>", "created": "2019-02-14T01:00:07Z", "subject": "swap request did not go through correctly", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "js3x3ecxj9g6h9", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8756, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547442649, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 415}
