My general sense was that the program was pretty good if you were sure that you wanted to take the specific classes laid out for you by the program - so if the upper division EE courses, physics courses, and the subset of MSE courses interested you, then it could be a good choice. I ended up finding that the program was pretty restrictive in terms of extra classes to take just because it was a joint major, and because you didn\u2019t even get to choose which upper divs to take. I ended up wanting to explore more CS in addition to EE after taking lower divs, so I opted to just switch to EECS instead.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-01-13T23:11:02Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/12 - 1/18", "bucket_order": 11, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-14T02:48:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k5da1e434204dn", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Had a friend do it and he wasn\u2019t too happy because it forces you to do a lot of specific EE and MSE courses. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t really give you flexibility and it doesn\u2019t seem to give you enough time to get indepth into either EE or MSE so it may actually put you at a worse position if you do not intend to pursue a PhD.
