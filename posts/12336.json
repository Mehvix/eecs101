Have you taken AP Physics in the past? If so, the circuits knowledge you take from there will come in helpful. If not, be sure to study the basics of circuits, such as what are resistors, capacitors, voltage, current, power, Ohm&#39;s law, Kirchoff&#39;s Laws. These are all basic details of electronic circuits that come from AP Physics. On top of that, you will also want to study what is superposition in circuits, what are operational amplifiers (op-amps) and common negative feedback op-amp topologies employed in circuits to create desired voltage outputs. That&#39;s basically all the electricity concepts you should carry over from 16A into 16B. Old versions of the 16A website have notes covering all of these topics that would serve as a helpful reference.
