Professor Babak Ayazifar is usually great about working through examples in class, so I needed less out-of-class review than with EE 16B/CS 61B/CS 70. The midterms can be challenging, but they&#39;re usually less competitive than the lower division classes so there can be less time spent on that as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although I haven&#39;t taken EE 123 myself, from what I&#39;ve heard from friends it starts off slow and ramps up exponentially.
