In my personal experience I have found that it is beneficial to email graduate students as they are often more likely to respond. Also, graduate students are generally looking for undergrads to bring aboard their project. Ask any graduate TAs you have had or even undergrad TAs that have done research, as they can put you in contact with other graduate students and/or professors that are willing to hire undergrads.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-04-25T20:03:17Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/21 - 4/27", "bucket_order": 56, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-25T23:25:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jux9z57cgwp4v3", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Look into the Data Science Discovery Research program!
