I think if you&#39;ve already taken Math 104, Math 110 and 113 will be much easier. I&#39;m pretty sure you know that upper div math classes have much less required work but are much more intensive in terms of difficulty. I heard Olga Holtz is teaching 110 though so I would take that into account because her classes may as well be considered &#34;honors&#34; in comparison to other professors. CS 170 is\u00a0a lot more difficult\u00a0than 70 and with slightly more workload in my opinion. I do think I struggled in the beginning of CS 170 as there is a jump from lower division to upper division courses. With lower division courses, as long as you put in the work, you can succeed but upper division courses require some level of &#34;ingenuity&#34; that hard work simply can&#39;t reward, but that may have been just me.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "isavdtjxldo7pe", "updated": "2018-10-22T20:56:15Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-22T19:31:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi, intended CS &#43; Math double major, declaring this semester.
