The Engineering Student Council is having our first General Meeting on September 10th from 8pm - 9:30pm PST. We will provide updates on what our organization is doing in the COE community and foster discussion around prime issues that our campus is enveloped in. These issues will be deliberated in case studies where we look at how aspects of our campus are tied to these problems: lack of accessibility/student advocacy in remote learning, low voter turnout of college-age citizens, and racism in academia. Attendees have the opportunity to receive $25 gift cards for BLK &amp; Bold Specialty Beverages.</p>\n<p><b>If you would like to attend, please fill out the RSVP form <a href=\"https://forms.gle/qa9ZAdqvaAGeF9Ap6\">here</a>.</b></p>", "created": "2020-09-06T04:39:58Z", "subject": "Engineering Student Council General Meeting #1 Announcement!!", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "keqlxos05gq4j1", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13106, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542588910, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrichment_opportunities", "events", "other", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 235}
