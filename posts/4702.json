I didn&#39;t take APCS in high school but took CS10 in fall 2016, so I did both programs to have a better chance of doing well in 61A. I think both programs helped me stay on track with material and get a better understanding of what was expected of me in the class, as 61A can be a bit overwhelming without much CS experience. I liked having the chance to review concepts in seminar/section so if you feel like you would benefit from the additional support, I would do both. If you prefer to review\u00a0independently and don&#39;t feel you need as much help/support but would like some review,\u00a0I would recommend CS Mentors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS Scholars: You aren&#39;t required to attend lab/discussion sections, but it gives you a chance to work with people you&#39;ll get to know (from same sections and seminar) in the program and ask for help from the TA (who will likely be leading the sections and seminar). For me, I did the labs on my own and just attended the discussion section. The lab/discussion for CS Scholars isn&#39;t really different from regular sections, except for the fact that people in them are also in CS Scholars.\u00a0I found the mandatory seminar to be worth it, as you get extra worksheets/practice/review (like another discussion section) to go over concepts and ask for help. We also had mock exams and review sessions for the class exams, which were really helpful when you already have limited exposure in CS.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS Mentors: You can sign up for a one-hour section, once a week, to go over recently-covered topics in class and do practice problems. These sections are only for groups of 3-4 people with 1 mentor and are pretty focused on the given worksheet. CS Mentors also holds review sessions before exams, which are nice if you want extra practice. Unlike CS Scholars, anyone in the class can sign up for a section (if space is available); it is not necessarily intended to support students with limited CS exposure, but rather anyone who would like to review concepts.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-08-08T21:17:31Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-08-09T20:36:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p><strong attention=\"i7pcvpnbkv75hi\">&#64;Charlene Hughes</strong> \u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-09T20:36:07Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ibtip4ceues3g0"}], "id": "j65h5t32r192xe", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-08-08T08:34:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "tutoring", "cs-intended", "lscs", "faculty_advising", "workshops"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p style=\"font-family:&#34;Helvetica&#34;;font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">CS Scholars is a program meant for EOP CS students (low income, minority, disadvantaged).

I&#39;m also not a minority or disadvantaged, but I did have somewhat limited exposure to CS (APCS). I would love to get some insight into the program and for those who were in the program, how has it impacted you as a CS student? Also, what&#39;s the difference between CS Mentors and Scholars?
