I&#39;ve taken quite a few courses that cover parts of EE 16B and I&#39;m wondering whether skipping EE 16B or taking EECS 47E would be an option for me. I am planning to take EE 120, EECS 127, and EECS 126 at some point, so if I&#39;m able\u00a0waive EE 16B, I\u00a0only want to do so, if I&#39;m prepared for those courses.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Relevant Courses Taken:</strong></p>\n<p>Lower Division Math (including Math 54)</p>\n<p>Math H110,\u00a0128A, H185, H113, 104</p>\n<p>CS 61A/B</p>\n<p>Physics 7A/B/C\u00a0</p>\n<p>Physics 111A/B and 110A/B</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve\u00a0heard that\u00a0 students\u00a0minoring/majoring in EECS have been able to use Math 54, Physics 111A, and Physics 7B to waive the EE 16A requirement in the past. Is that still possible? Also, would any combination of the above courses cover a significant portion of EE 16B so that I can waive the requirement entirely or so that I can take EECS 47E instead? Originally I wasn&#39;t planning on minoring in EECS, I was just going to self study EE 16A/B material and then take EE 120, EECS 126, and EECS 127. I&#39;ve looked through past EE 16B course websites and most of the material is review. So I was also thinking that maybe I can self study EE16A/B and then use\u00a0 EE 120 to waive the EE 16B requirement. I realize that EE 16B has a lab component that EE 120 doesn&#39;t have, but I think Physics 111A/111B labs cover a lot of the same material covered in the EE 16B labs. I can then take 3 other upper div. EE/EECS/CS courses (EECS 126, 127, CS 170) to fulfill the upper div. minor requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2019-11-06T19:01:14Z", "subject": "EE 16B or EECS 47E", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k2nnegtj1vt5rg", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10763, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545223108, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ju4j3glepcg39x", "name": "Thee H", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1565840066, "jw6kndsic346lm": 1562564221}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvexhlmpa3zk", "name": "Sunay Poole", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "juwz5t7uyqh4sa", "name": "Prakash Srivastava", "photo": "1594332334_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/juwz5t7uyqh4sa/1594332334_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ju4j3glepcg39x", "jktvexhlmpa3zk", "juwz5t7uyqh4sa"], "tags": ["eecs", "faculty_advising", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 372}
