Upper-division courses at Berkeley are mostly a deeper dive into certain sub-domains, and you most likely don&#39;t need to take as many upper-divs as you might think right now if you&#39;re trying to start off as a generalist SWE. Only take those that upper-divs whose focus may interest you and/or if you&#39;re interested in pursuing a career in those specific sub-domains.
