DRUMMOND** <[wdrummon@berkeley.edu](mailto:wdrummon@berkeley.edu)\\> Date: Mon, Aug 2, 2021, 09:01 Subject: San Quentin News Editing Class To: Babak AYAZIFAR <[ayazifar@berkeley.edu](mailto:ayazifar@berkeley.edu)\\>\n\nDear\u00a0Babak,\n\nI know it's a reach, but you might know of some aspiring engineers who might\u00a0be interested in social justice causes.\n\n\u00a0I'm recruiting a few good students to add to my San Quentin News editing class this fall. Undergraduates are welcome. Engineers usually have crushing course loads, but this course is user-friendly. The meetings all take place at the prison. Students spend 90-minutes inside San Quentin's\u00a0Media Center a week. Most often we visit on Sundays.\u00a0\n\nMost of the students say it's a life-changing experience.\n\nIf you have any prospects, please send them my way.\n\nIt will be a\u00a0significant year. It's the\u00a050th anniversary of the death of George Jackson at\u00a0San Quentin.\n\nWould appreciate your help.\n\nYours,\n\nBill\n\n\\--\n\nWilliam Drummond, professor of journalism\n\nAuthor of \"_Prison Truth: The Story of the San Quentin News_,\" published by UC Press\n\n[https://lat.ms/39thooO](https://lat.ms/39thooO)\n\n[http://bit.ly/2H04xhZ](http://bit.ly/2H04xhZ)\n\n[https://bit.ly/3c2OAYr](https://bit.ly/3c2OAYr)\n\n[http://bit.ly/31D14za](http://bit.ly/31D14za)</md>", "created": "2021-08-05T18:46:48Z", "subject": "San Quentin News Editing Class", "uid": "gxbf8pi4slh6yg"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "krz9tdc2n7d4co", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 15468, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539971767, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jrjl90lkcv16lz": 1550604197}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6f50gkgogx", "name": "Saif Chowdhury", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjs6f50gkgogx", "is6p9mf96y2ty"], "tags": ["enrichment_opportunities", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 433}
