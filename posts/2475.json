It&#39;s impressive to be able to talk about all the low-level systems things during interviews, and know exactly what&#39;s going on. You should try to make significant contributions to the projects to get good takeaways from the class. You&#39;ll also get better at coding C.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The tests and the projects seem a little misaligned. The projects are heavy coding based, and one small error is super costly in time to find and fix. So although you get a really firm understanding of the project and its related stuff, the tests touch on other things too. Like general OS/systems trivia seeming, with some fair coding parts. Don&#39;t skip discussion, go to a great TA&#39;s section and learn the fuck out of the stuff. It&#39;s interesting and tough and makes you all the more tougher after you take it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2016-10-26T19:22:26Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "iurb5kt2vne5h4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idgolh4wbr7596", "name": "Parth Singhal", "photo": "1446408231_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idgolh4wbr7596/1446408231_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idgolh4wbr7596"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 10/23 - 10/29", "bucket_order": 185, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-26T19:56:42Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "iurcdmu11655tq", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I&#39;m in the course this semester and have a great group, so projects have gone well and have not been too stressful.
