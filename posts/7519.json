Different types of secure hardware must make different security and performance tradeoffs and contend with different adversaries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will discuss current and classic research papers in the area, as well as state of the art deployed designs. We will have a special focus on the development of hardware enclaves: secure hardware components designed to support verifiable and trusted execution of programs remotely.</p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course is 3-units, and will consist of several research paper readings per week, in-class discussions of the papers, and a large course project per project group.</p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We require that graduate students have taken at least one architecture course previously, and strongly recommend that students have a background in relevant security topics.</p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Undergraduates will be considered and may apply via this form <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScskMACikbExvLm1Pbhf6AeIj0F6-ZXWAr9lOteJYqV3VMKQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lectures: M 10-11:30am</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Room: Soda 405</p>\n<br />The course webpage is available <a href=\"https://berkeley-secure-hardware.github.io/cs294-156-f18/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</div>", "created": "2018-08-22T20:30:45Z", "subject": "CS294-156: Advanced Topics in secure hardware", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jl5lex6m6luop", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7519, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548720273, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 456}
