I was certainly biased, having TA&#39;d multiple times for each of the latter classes and thus having a much deeper familiarity with those materials than most students would, but I think that Friedman himself wasn&#39;t aware of how much overlap there was. (There&#39;s still enough material for the class to be worth taking; it was just annoyingly redundant up to the first midterm.)</p>\n<p>I would agree that 174 doesn&#39;t assume any\u00a0<em>particular</em> algorithmic knowledge, but having that general algorithmic-maturity should be quite useful. So, I would discourage it, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s as strong of a prereq as it could be. (That is, if some other professor was teaching the course, I would be much more cautious.)</p>\n<p>Although, I would say that 174, while being an extension of the probability section of 70, is more like the first half of CS70 in the sense that it is more theory-heavy (e.g. algorithms) and proof-focused, compared to 126, which is still reasonably theoretical (much more than 70) but relatively more computational.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think taking EE126 at the same time changes anything. Other than at parts where they both overlap with 70, there&#39;s not much other overlap between the two.</p>", "created": "2018-01-02T04:09:38Z", "subject": "", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>How interesting the class is somewhat depends on what your interests are.\u00a0 If you&#39;re really interested in algorithms and CS theory, it&#39;s a great class to take; if you&#39;re more interested in just writing code, maybe not so much.\u00a0 Sorta the best litmus test for this is how much you liked 170 (174 is somewhat of a cross between 170 and 126), though from your question it sounds like you haven&#39;t taken that yet, so that&#39;s probably not super helpful advice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Speaking of 170, it is a prereq for 174 with good reason.\u00a0 174 in effect assumes that you know how to think about algorithms, prove correctness, etc--which is much of what 170 gives you.\u00a0 It doesn&#39;t rely particularly heavily on any specific topic from 170 (so there&#39;s no point where it&#39;s really necessary for you to know, say, DP or divide-and-conquer), so you could in theory at least get away with taking the two of them together.\u00a0 But without the theoretical background 170 provides, it will probably be much more difficult to keep up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for Professor Friedman, he&#39;s pretty good.\u00a0 His lecturing style is\u00a0not the most exciting, but is fairly clear and easy to follow.\u00a0 His lectures follow the book quite closely, so it is possible to just read the book if that works better for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tl;dr: 174 is a cool class if you like 170 and the probability section of 70.\u00a0 Taking it concurrently with 170 might be a challenge, but is certainly doable.</p>", "created": "2017-12-31T00:22:33Z", "subject": "", "uid": "icguxy0896q1j8"}], "id": "jbu17txjl5h75w", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p815tz306kj", "name": "Averal Kandala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"jjnjp9mea54uy": 1536696387}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy6ln9pj1pi", "name": "Srinivasa Pranav", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hc6qtswtj87bi", "name": "Ye Wang", "photo": "1521329882_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hc6qtswtj87bi/1521329882_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ijkj0mez6r218b": 1, "j3b97758y6d1tj": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijly8cfwGjP", "name": "Nader Namini", "photo": "1544211678_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ijly8cfwGjP/1544211678_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p815tz306kj", "icguy6ln9pj1pi", "hc6qtswtj87bi", "ijly8cfwGjP"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-30T10:23:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Can someone give some more information on CS 174?
