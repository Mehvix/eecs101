Each session is 50 minutes, taught online, and teachers use the curriculum and teacher portal developed by Juni. We expect most teachers to work 4-10 hours per week, and teachers can earn $20-25&#43; / hour based on performance. We\u2019re looking for teachers that have taken CS 61A or equivalent and, most importantly, enjoy working with younger students and building their interest in CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please reach out to careers&#64;learnwithjuni.com if you\u2019re interested, and we\u2019ll provide you with more details!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Obviously that&#39;s just a message I&#39;m passing on, but in complete honesty, this is a really neat opportunity. It&#39;s pretty fun and really rewarding if you enjoy teaching. In my experience, normal part time jobs interfere with school a ton but this doesn&#39;t at all. I just squeeze a 50 minute\u00a0lesson between classes, and get paid instead of just wasting my time on YouTube or whatever.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-09-19T02:16:05Z", "subject": "Teaching opportunity", "uid": "idkkusd0c466hc"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "jm8in099wig3gl", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7639, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548610776, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7c2ca2q62f", "name": "Jacob Martinez", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p7c2ca2q62f"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 425}
