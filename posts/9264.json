I have artamanov for 104 currently, and he is definitely very nice but I personally don&#39;t like his lectures that much. He basically copies definitions, theorems, and proofs from the book, and only very occasionally stops for intuition. I also think he spends a little too much time going over basic definitions, and doesn&#39;t leave enough time for the more involved proofs. He does convey everything, but it is a bit dry to me sometimes. I agree the homeworks and exams are\u00a0fair though. The only other thing you should probably take into consideration is that when asked what an average grade on an exam corresponded to, he said &#34;probably a C&#43;&#34;, so his curve is not very forgiving, assuming he does not change his answer by the end of the semester.</p>", "created": "2019-04-21T19:26:46Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Math 113 is a good
