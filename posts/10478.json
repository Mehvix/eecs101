You may want to read past posts on this piazza about that. Otherwise you should be fine, I know students who took 61C, 61B and EE16A/B concurrently and they were\u00a0okay\u00a0(though keep in mind it is a very heavy workload since all of these courses have labs and 61B and 61C have rather lengthy projects). You may want to consider taking 61B and then 61C in another semester with some upper div. course, as this is what I think students typically do. But, you know your own schedule best and will have to figure that out yourself.
