You really really want a lab partner who you can stick with through the semester and rely on to get code out EVERY DAY.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-The labs were due 23 hours after you began them, so you have to be with the course at all times. You can&#39;t just put it off to study for another class, since you have to devote time every day. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I really enjoyed cs61BL. I felt I learned a lot better by actually coding than listening to someone lecture about coding.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying to take another tech (read:homework intensive) class with it though. I took Physics 7C and 61BL summer 2016 and had very little free time. The labs generally took 3~ hours on average, but some labs were much longer (meaning you had to do it on your own time within 23 hours) (p.s. streams lab LOL).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>from the course info page (which I found to be accurate):</p>\n<div>&#34;</div>\n<div><strong>What sort of time commitment should I expect?</strong></div>\n<div>A lot. This is a summer course, which means it is run at twice the speed of a normal course. In addition, 61B naturally has more involved programming than 61A, and 61BL has even more. We\u00a0<em>strongly recommend</em>\u00a0not taking any other courses alongside 61BL.</div>\n<div>We cannot predict how many hours you will spend on the course; some students take more time than others. However, we can at least give you a brief breakdown of what you will have to do in this course:</div>\n<ul><li>Students will spend 12 hours a week in lab.</li><li>Expect to take time after labs to complete the lab.</li><li>There is a single two-hour lecture each week.</li><li>There are three projects in the 8 weeks of the course.</li><li>There are three exams in the 8 weeks of the course.</li></ul>\n<p>&#34;</p>\n<p>That said, it is certainly possible, you just might not enjoy your summer much!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-03-08T21:30:19Z", "subject": "", "uid": "iduidacrnd83ze"}], "id": "j01hac1bl8t2si", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1542387698, "j6bczj0pmoo4mk": 1512278032, "jaepthp7wf44nh": 1525327897, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1538161283, "jr1f3sutei62un": 1550805110, "jz2c8op4xqq4z3": 1576298894}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ixwrh8mz7qt1nn", "name": "Brian Hung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ixwrh8mz7qt1nn"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 3/5 - 3/11", "bucket_order": 169, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/5 - 3/11", "bucket_order": 169, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-10T03:31:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j039m9bw4zy6qn", "subject": "<p>If a student took Math 54 already, is it still advised against to take EE16A and CS61BL during the summer?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2017-03-10T03:31:11Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-10T02:05:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j036jk8mcr5fl", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "EE16A summer edition will be folding 2 weeks of Fall/Spring semester work into a week, so we do not recommend taking another class with big time commitment.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "hqlw1f5vivi399", "updated": "2017-03-10T02:05:06Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-08T05:32:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs-intended", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Can anyone share their experiences taking one or both of these classes during the summer?
