Understanding the concepts in 126 at a deep level is honestly much harder than doing well grade-wise (since the curve is pretty lenient), so that would mean reading and annotating the weekly course notes, going to office hours, etc. While you may not spend much time working on actual class work, the concepts will end up taking a lot of mental effort to get through which may be why people find it so tough!</div>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-01-08T21:31:48Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"3706": 0, "3810": 4, "5433": 9, "6414": 3, "6612": 8, "6933": 5, "7093": 7, "8177": 6, "9040": 2, "9623": 1}}, "created": "2020-01-08T08:23:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a Econ &#43; CS double major.
