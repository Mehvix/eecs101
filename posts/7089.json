A typical project prompt would be like &#34;build a patch that uses the X, Y, Z features that we learnt about in class&#34;.\u00a0<br />Classes took place in Tolman&#39;s computer labs, and were all structured essentially like your typical 61abc labs; the prof will explain/demonstrate something new in Max and we got to mess around with it. Overall I thought the class was super cool, but maybe that&#39;s because I was already really interested in music/sound synthesis. Also this was like a 5 person class over the summer so things may be different during the semester when the class gets much larger.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-05-27T04:16:15Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-27T03:42:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhoa3t2wd32gb", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What do you do in that class?
