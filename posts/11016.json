I am planning on applying to be a mentor but I was wondering how the support system for mentors themselves\u00a0is structured? I am honestly afraid that I forgot some concepts in the class and won&#39;t be able to answer people&#39;s questions in section (plus since I took it over the summer there&#39;s a couple concepts we didn&#39;t go over) and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only person who&#39;s felt this way, so I want to know if there&#39;s like a weekly meeting or something where the mentors for that class quickly go over the worksheet and teaching tips for the week or something. I&#39;m really passionate about the course and am willing to dedicate some time into relearning things, but I just don&#39;t want to be a bad mentor lol so I&#39;m asking for advice here.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>also if anyone wants to share their general experience of being a cs(m) mentor that would be great!</p>", "created": "2019-12-24T18:40:21Z", "subject": "question for people who are current csm mentors!", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k4k7shhlykrw2", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11016, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544900252, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1572839448_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1572839448_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd0ebjf50lh"], "tags": ["eecs", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 379}
