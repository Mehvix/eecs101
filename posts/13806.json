Dr. Sperry joined the mathematics department in 1917 as an instructor and was awarded the assistant professorship in 1923. She was later promoted to associate professor in 1931 and was given the title of Associate Professor Of Mathematics Emeritus in 1952. She was an incredible mathematician, an exceptional teacher, and a prominent activist.<br />To celebrate Dr. Sperry\u2019s impact on the mathematical community, we are celebrating women in mathematics who exemplify these same qualities of inspiring mentorship and compassionate leadership.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Time: Dec 3, 2020 06:00 PM Pacific Time (US and Canada)<br />zoom:\u00a0<a href=\"https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/95823852495?pwd=MjFWa0IwS3NuUEw4VFB0OHlrTCs3Zz09Meeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/95823852495?pwd=MjFWa0IwS3NuUEw4VFB0OHlrTCs3Zz09Meeting</a>\u00a0ID: 958 2385 2495<br />Passcode: wimandmusa</p>\n</div>", "created": "2020-12-01T00:20:16Z", "subject": "WIM Weekly Updates!!", "uid": "jr5gjfypxyb3mb"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "ki58iym777tej", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13806, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541818307, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd0ebjf50lh"], "tags": ["announcements", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 261}
