Additionally, joint gaussians - which are the essential noise model you will study in 189 - are a big component in the latter half of 126. Also covered (but not as relevant to 189) are discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, Bernoulli processes, Poisson processes (these 2 in particular really help unify your conception of the different probability distributions from CS70), and Markov decision processes, which are relevant to CS188.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Something rarely mentioned is the lab portion of 126. I found that this helped to really solidify the concepts in my head, especially for concepts like the Viterbi algorithm and the Kalman filter that\u00a0are much harder to explain through formulas but trivial to understand as code.\u00a0If you are a CS student, I highly recommend EE126.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stat 134 mainly focuses on continuous probability - random variables, expectation, covariance, some common distributions like the multivariate gaussian.
