I hear 151 is a high workload class so I wanted to know and I hear it\u2019s a extremely recruitable course because it\u2019s super industry useful but is that in hardware only or in SWE overall? Also would it be good for be good in SWE and ML balanced here or take more purely of one or the other?\u00a0<div><br /></div><div>Thanks!</div>", "created": "2019-11-02T20:04:09Z", "subject": "ML EECS 151", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k2hzvyknlqv4pk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10714, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545386942, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb"], "tags": ["student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 287}
