It is a course that teaches you how to think like an engineer and design systems, using the tools of linear algebra to tackle challenging real-world problems in signal processing, circuit design, machine learning, information processing, and robotics/control theory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is still tremendous value in taking a traditional, axiom-based linear algebra course like Math 54 or 110. This will not only help you understand the concepts at a deeper and more intuitive level, but it will serve you better in the long run.\u00a0 Don&#39;t get me wrong\u2014EE16ab were incredible classes and a lot of fun for me, and I definitely learned a lot from them. The homework problems challenge you to think in new ways, and the labs and iPython notebooks are really cool (they complement the material well, too). The professors who regularly teach these courses are also really good. However, as engineering courses, I feel like they lack the mathematical rigor that you can get from a more math-heavy course in Linear Algebra.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The approach taken in EE16ab is top-down: they start by asking questions and formulating problems that can be solved with linear algebra, then recreate the theory needed to solve these problems. The is in contrast to the bottom-up approach taken in math courses, where they introduce vector spaces, inner products, and linear transformations in terms of basic axioms and build up all theorems and key results in a fully rigorous manner, proving everything along the way. This axiomatic approach is highly valuable to developing an intuitive \u201cfeel\u201d for linear algebra and getting used to writing mathematical proofs. Furthermore, it allows students to reason with vectors and linear maps as abstract objects rather than just ordered tuples and matrices, which allows one to generalize and apply analogous reasoning in new and unique situations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is value in thinking like a mathematician as well as like an engineer. In short, while the EE 16ab courses are incredible courses in their own regard, I don\u2019t think they can (or should) serve as a replacement for a mathematically rigorous linear algebra course like Math 54 or 110. Even though it may not be required for the CS/EECS major, linear algebra is highly useful and applicable, and a traditional linear algebra course will serve you well throughout your academic and professional career.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For freshmen who are entering, I\u2019d strongly recommend taking Math 54 before, or in parallel, with EE 16a. For students who have taken EE 16a/b already, I\u2019d strongly recommend taking Math 110.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"karb4ksduhb1ae": 1593408415}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6k59skr5gd", "name": "Titan Yuan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i5anwjhkfuvw1", "name": "Vrettos Moulos", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhwn369f6ik", "name": "Kevin Zhu", "photo": "1629851676_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvhwn369f6ik/1629851676_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jz9gltnmf1358i", "name": "Andrew Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh19bukde2t2", "name": "Zeyi (Jackson) Yan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jljmu83hBAP2", "name": "Andrew Lenz", "photo": "1611200788_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jljmu83hBAP2/1611200788_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4v1umgas6rl", "name": "Kevin Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu5fd92zq4sk", "name": "Christopher Gong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbv45k4mo3h2z2", "name": "Curran Walton", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdiaof6ft4f8", "name": "Milleno Pan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k9etsb2ladd376", "name": "Dhruti Pandya", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1641312351, "kdo94dnotzp1e5": 1608068756, "ke3tewrxmn57lj": 1604516868, "kfn3pakx2el278": 1608298900}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ju4j3glepcg39x", "name": "Thee Ho", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1648937487_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1648937487_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4vtgpbb37h7", "name": "Stephanie Djajadi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeun3n6ef0vj", "name": "Kevin Han", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j7uqei5qhxd7kl", "name": "Kunal Agarwal", "photo": "1529353054_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j7uqei5qhxd7kl/1529353054_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6k59skr5gd", "i5anwjhkfuvw1", "jktvhwn369f6ik", "jz9gltnmf1358i", "jzdh19bukde2t2", "jljmu83hBAP2", "j6d4v1umgas6rl", "j6nu5fd92zq4sk", "kbv45k4mo3h2z2", "jzqdiaof6ft4f8", "k9etsb2ladd376", "ju4j3glepcg39x", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "j6d4vtgpbb37h7", "kbeun3n6ef0vj", "j7uqei5qhxd7kl"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_13", "updated": "2020-05-19T18:04:53Z"}], "config": {"editor": "md", "has_emails_sent": 1}, "created": "2019-08-13T20:02:49Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<md>This post is intended to address some questions we have been receiving about the EECS 16A-16B course series.

EECS16A has no prerequisites other than calculus and is designed with freshmen and incoming transfer students in mind. It is designed to be taken alongside 61A. Furthermore, we reserve seats for freshmen and incoming transfer students in the class, so you are essentially guaranteed a spot in the class your first year. It will be harder to get into the class as an upperclassman. \n\nQ2: Should I take EECS 16A and EECS 16B before or after CS 70? \nA2: EECS16A and 16B were specifically designed to help ease the transition to CS70 for incoming students. These classes provide an introduction to proofs and the kind of mathematical thinking that is very useful in a class like CS70. We recommend you take 16AB before taking CS70, this should help you have an easier time in CS 70.\n\nQ3: Should I take MATH 54 before taking EECS16A? \nA3: EECS 16A is designed to be taken without any prerequisites, so there is no need to take MATH 54 before EECS 16A. EECS 16AB teaches linear algebra with the intent of preparing you for courses like EECS 127 (Optimization) and EECS 189 (Machine Learning) and provides engineering and machine learning examples and applications for linear algebra.
