So, I&#39;m in CS 189 waitlist but I got a no reply email saying that I have not been enrolled to the class due to schedule time conflict. However, CS 189 allows time conflict, and I checked my other classes and none of them have time conflict with CS 189 lecture. CS 189 discussion&#39;s time is listed as Sunday as a placeholder I think, and it is the only thing that may have conflicted with my other CS 170&#39;s discussion time which also uses the same time probably as placeholder. Now, I am bumped down back in the waitlist because of that.
