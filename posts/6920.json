CS61C does more than introduce you to a variety of subfields, it also gives you an appreciation for how computer systems (from your laptop to warehouse-scale computing centres) work. Because as an intern you&#39;re likely to be shepparded into a company with an existing computing system (and you&#39;ll have to learn how to interact with it!) CS61C may be more relevant than you think. Also, if you don&#39;t have a set subfield in mind (think: what part of CS are you interested in doing an i ternship in?), CS61C introduces you to a lot of new industry areas too.Regarding 170, I found that it introduced me to a more algorithmic line of thinking, but the content itself wasn&#39;t &#34;internship prep&#34; material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(It&#39;s worth noting, I&#39;m a TA for 61C, so my bias is probably pretty strong.)</p>", "created": "2018-05-04T18:44:33Z", "subject": "", "uid": "idgok7br5s74ae"}], "id": "jgsb6mw4f7c7d5", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1557211355, "j6ipkhtdol54dw": 1, "jcfrsqcwoyyi5": 1523820522, "jiow4wnlt5e4v9": 1536690148, "jpdq1epqrr3231": 1557544831, "k5ccgxwqsc126b": 1582933242, "k5oggml4hjtu9": 1581048462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6srsl4o5no", "name": "Benson Yuan", "photo": "1548892164_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6srsl4o5no/1548892164_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p759ji5o5ws", "name": "Vera Wang", "photo": "1529996635_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p759ji5o5ws/1529996635_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8jylx2fl", "name": "Xinyun Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p6srsl4o5no", "is6p759ji5o5ws", "is6p8jylx2fl"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-03T21:26:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Next fall I will be a Sophomore (in EECS), and have so far completed CS61AB, CS70, EE16AB, and math 53. For my phase 1, I was originally going to sign up for CS61C and CS170 in addition to Physics 7B, but at the last minute I decided not to enroll in 61C, and instead picked up Astro 7A (to fulfill the last part of the natural science requirement). My reasoning was that I have heard many things about the heavy workload and difficulty of 61C and I have also heard that the knowledge gained in 170 is very important for job and internship interviews (whereas 61C is not so much except a few more specific subfields), and seeing as I would like to start looking for internships next semester/year, I thought it would be better to focus on 170 and push CS61C until after I have finished 170 and started looking for internships. However, as I have not taken either course, I am not completely sure of my decision. Could any students who have already taken these courses give me some insight or advice into whether or not I should delay 61C?
