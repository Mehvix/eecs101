The thing is, I've taken the common recommendations provided to students who are entering industry, including 170, 161, 162, 186. One of the classes I plan on taking next semester is 189 (since I still haven't taken it) and I've also taken 126+127 in preparation for it.\n\nI was looking at the list of courses offered for Spring 2022 and it seems like there are less courses than usual being offered. Hence, I'm not really sure what else to pick. I was thinking of taking 168 since I've heard it's helpful but apparently that class is very unlikely to be offered. Other than that, I've heard 169 is redundant if you've done internships before (which I have). According to the catalogue, I don't see any 194 Special Topics courses or I would have taken one of those since some of them seemed pretty interesting (like Data Engineering). I'm also looking at some of the INFO courses since I've heard they have a few good practical courses that one can take.\n\nHence, I was curious to know if anyone had recommendations for classes to take in their final semester that would be useful for someone entering industry who has taken all the 'common' recommendations? It doesn't really need to be within the CS department (a course from the INFO department for example is fine), as long as you feel it would help prepare me for industry or round out my education in an area you feel is critical. \n\nP.S. Does anyone know if Berkeley offers a Distributed Systems class (like this MIT one [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/))? I'm *really* interested in the subject but I feel classes like 186 and 162 only briefly went over it at the end but didn't really dive deep into it. If there's a class at Berkeley teaching it, I would love to take that since I've heard it's really helpful later in your career.  </md>", "created": "2021-09-29T06:39:22Z", "subject": "Good courses for industry other than the obvious ones?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "ku551r49s4m5yu", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 15759, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539656621, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji4zyrg94hv49t", "name": "Yasoob Khalid Niazi", "photo": "1530981380_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ji4zyrg94hv49t/1530981380_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1598917273, "jzmxfhaex9yto": 1574281407, "k5cww7u4ca46ve": 1585042010, "ke3aj8z75apb0": 1598917273}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr10lbajldlya", "name": "Aayush Shah", "photo": "1581230766_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jr10lbajldlya/1581230766_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jza9erz2ojy3qr": 1576200494, "jzdgwm8woye1ll": 1569470919}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvic99iwa6yj", "name": "Matthew Tang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdjl24y7f5nf", "name": "Amritansh Saraf", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdtbe44qa182t5", "name": "Evgeny Pobachienko", "photo": "1611701958_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kdtbe44qa182t5/1611701958_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyba53fo3xg45z", "name": "Brandon Fajardo", "photo": "1575323577_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jyba53fo3xg45z/1575323577_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhln7qf4679", "name": "James Jung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktviadu64j6ww", "name": "Lucas Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k5he82r8pyr772", "name": "Aditya Singh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdus1h62qkr61h", "name": "Golnaz Atarod", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfq764k14kg", "name": "Abinav", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd05knejlh0", "name": "Ruby Werman", "photo": "1602797600_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd05knejlh0/1602797600_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ji4zyrg94hv49t", "jr10lbajldlya", "jktvic99iwa6yj", "jwupbl14eqmsc", "jzqdjl24y7f5nf", "kdtbe44qa182t5", "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "jyba53fo3xg45z", "jktvhln7qf4679", "jktviadu64j6ww", "k5he82r8pyr772", "kdus1h62qkr61h", "jktvfq764k14kg", "jjzd05knejlh0"], "tags": ["eecs", "enrollments", "faculty_advising", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 372}
