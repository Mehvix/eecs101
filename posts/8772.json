You might want to spend 2-3 days(ideally when nothing is due for both classes), sleep a little bit less than usual, skip some socials and gym, so you can be caught up with lecture. Open up your piazzas for them and ask questions when you don&#39;t understand material. But you should be caught up with lecture at the very least.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Find a good partner for 61c, lab and projects. They will help you finish and learn. Find study partners as well, people who could help and who you could help outside of office hours. Make a FB chat, maybe you can find the humor in your fears if you&#39;re all sending memes and stuff.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. Consistency is key here. When you finish problem sets, or a project, don&#39;t procrastinate the very next day. It sucks, but you need to keep grinding. Of course, take breaks, and go out with friends, but i&#39;ve seen many people, in both classes, take a weekend off, etc after completing a hard assignment. Give yourself a satisfying reward after, get good nights rest, so you can continue the next day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. Watch diet, sleep, and exercise. Improving these may help you have more energy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5. If time is an issue, focus on lectures(don&#39;t do extra readings if you truly don&#39;t have time), go to empty discussions so you can ask a ton of questions, and sign up for 1 on 1 tutoring 61c. Daniel Zhang was my TA and he is phenomenal. Highly recommend if you&#39;re having trouble finding a TA that works for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6. For 170, I highly recommend OH if you&#39;re stuck on hw. People around may help. Also, highly recommend OH for 61c if you&#39;re lost as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, 61c material was hard for me to grasp, and 170 was very tough for many of my peers. There&#39;s probably a ton more advice I can give, but overall: Just take a deep breath, be around some kind friends in the class, and just keep working and trying. If you&#39;re super stuck, ask for help on piazza and from friends. So many people stress with 170 and 61c, but you&#39;ll pull through. The fact that you asked tells me you&#39;re going to work even harder now and you will learn a ton this semester and more importantly, improve your habits and yourself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helps. I&#39;m sure others can give helpful advice as well.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-02-19T05:06:12Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/17 - 2/23", "bucket_order": 61, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-02-19T08:33:49Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jsbii492iwu1xr", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>From what I&#39;ve heard, most people are super worried about 61c at this point due to the high workload.

I don&#39;t know if this place is the right place to ask this, but does anyone has tips how to survive? I really want to learn the content thoroughly in these classes instead of cramming the materials before the tests. I&#39;m just worried everyday that I am not even being productive at this point.
