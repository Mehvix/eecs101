I&#39;m a CS/Math major that took Math 54 (with Srivastava) my first semester here and thought it was one of the easier classes I&#39;ve taken here. I took Math 53 with Frenkel the next semester, and although the workload was lighter, the content was slightly more difficult than 54. I enrolled in Math 55/CS 70 but ended up dropping CS70 by the 5th week not because of difficulty but because it had too much unnecessary busy work. (I was taking 23 total units at the time) All I can really say is if you&#39;re doing a major in Math, 55 may be one of the most crucial classes to take in order to survive any upper division math courses. I don&#39;t know how busy you will be but I will attest to the comment above saying that professors do play a huge role in the delivery of content and grade distributions for math classes (much more than CS classes).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tldr It&#39;s definitely doable but you will always have to put in the work. I have no idea who&#39;s teaching what next semester so I can&#39;t really say for myself but Math 53 with Frenkel is pretty chill especially since there&#39;s only 1 midterm and I took Math 55 with Holtz and it was possibly one of the most difficult lower division classes I took at Berkeley partly because the homework consisted of 5 of the most difficult problems she could come up with each week. (most were competition level, I remember she took a problem off of the IMO) However, that being said, both classes were very worthwhile and definitely great classes to take.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "isavdtjxldo7pe", "updated": "2018-03-23T21:01:31Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-22T04:29:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am a possible math/CS double currently taking Math 54 and find it very doable.
