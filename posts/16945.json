Here\u2019s a link to reasonably simple notes on the subject:\u00a0https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/ionospheric/hf-propagation-basics.php</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>But briefly, the upper ionosphere (also called the F layer) at around 100-500 miles (we call it space, since the ISS and many satellites orbit is at that elevation) has very sparse concentration of small atoms\u2014 like Hydrogen and Helium. The sun radiation ionizes these atoms\u2014 creating a region which interacts with radio waves \u2014think of it as a change in index of refraction, which similarly affects light passing through a dense medium. \u00a0This region has denser concentration of gas atoms at the lower elevation and sparser at the higher \u2014 creating a gradient in the index of refraction. This causes the radio-waves to bend, and keep bending till they are completely returned to earth. This skip can be as long as 2000 miles depending on the angle of the radio waves, their frequency and the level of ionization.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Below I have two photos, courtesy of Prof. Laura Waller. The first figure shows a green laser light in a water tank that exhibits total reflection when transitioning from the denser refraction index of water to air. Most people thing of the upper atmosphere as having the same effect\u2014 but this is not the case.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The second shows the same tank\u2014 filled with sugar water. The experiment was designed such that the concentration of sugar at the bottom is higher, and slowly decreases towards the top. This creates a gradient in the index of refraction of light. In th photo, a ray of green laser is refracted and bent due to passing through this gradient till it is \u00a0bounced back to the bottom\u2014 in a similar way that skyways are refracted \u00a0in the F layer of the ionosphere.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More later!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u2014 Miki</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F0a2c0eced8a55e80d1504bae2df952b86801132cc419fbc4c58839bc7212201f%2Ftotal-reflection.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"412\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fa44de506ad9546b735388ae2aa9965c0a01466d44c66cae7317cb95848e85399%2Fsugrar-water-refraction.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F66a5d3973f2ff3475e4b0b9c324f48d608dfbe35cdec1d648cbe872422c8b958%2Fnu6xb-12.png\" width=\"735\" height=\"518\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F18ed1f44b02b7b55193044ec41be9662c2c895c5562a410a629ae91775e10a3b%2FNU6XB-14.png\" width=\"789\" height=\"461\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>", "created": "2022-04-26T01:21:19Z", "subject": "EECS Balloon update day 6!", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l2fgprhunaj7m5", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16945, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538365946, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "enrichment_opportunities", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 255}
