Synchronous class attendance is encouraged but makeup assignments are provided. Just enroll using one of these codes: Pub Pol 98: 22958 (lower div) or Pub Pol 198: 23001 (upper div)!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This class is designed to bring together policy, technology, and entrepreneurship with a focus on national security innovation and tech policy. There will be discussions on topics like public interest tech, election security and democracy, climate security, and the impacts of artificial intelligence on foreign policy. There will also be a variety of guest speakers: policymakers and technologists serving in the Biden administration, leaders in academia surrounding ethics and security, as well as venture capitalists and startup founders. Finally, there will be an opportunity to work on a hands-on project with clients on a topic such as creating policy to improve cybersecurity information sharing between private sector and public sector, developing products that enhance autonomous vehicle usage in disaster response scenarios, or shaping policy about cryptocurrency and NFT use in government. There will be an end-of-semester showcase for these projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/6220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/6220</a></p>", "created": "2022-01-17T07:36:32Z", "subject": "Join the Tech Policy DeCal!", "uid": "ke2c16l0oxs76z"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kyidiyvg8391yk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16408, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538947711, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "enrichment_opportunities", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 240}
