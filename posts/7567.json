You might wanna read both.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Senior interested in Software Engineering, and you go to UC Berkeley? You&#39;re in a great spot!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You have three options:</p>\n<p>1. You take Spring semester off, intern, then intern this summer, then recruit for full time job and graduate next fall.</p>\n<p>2. Graduate this year, look for companies that accept interns post grad this summer, then recruit for full time job after.</p>\n<p>3. Graduate this year, and look for full time job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By no experience, i&#39;m guessing no internships? That&#39;s totally okay. You&#39;ll be fine choosing any of those options. Internships are nice because it gives you a decently accurate taste of the industry and real world experience. This experience can make you more marketable for employers, and provide skills, both technical and non technical.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What changes though....is your strategy. But there are some constants of importance when it comes to what you do next:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. (Most Important) Have an appealing resume. I suggest going to Career Center, Maybe HKN/UPE, Friends, even putting your resume on CS Career Questions on Reddit. It&#39;s a bit difficult providing practical tips on resumes online...I personally have all my contact info, classes, some awards, school and major, GPA(totally optional), CS languages and tools, CS Work and CS Teaching experience, 4 CS projects, 1 leadership experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. I&#39;m not a cover letter guy personally, but I think it can only help?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. Actually apply to many many companies. Tons of websites post jobs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. Cracking Coding Interview -&gt; Leetcode -&gt; Hackerrank. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have a great resume but didn&#39;t brush up on 61b and (sometimes) 170 problems. (In some cases you may be asked Q&#39;s from other courses like 61c). At this point, try to do at least 1 problem a day?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5. Referrals will definitely help.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6. If you took 61b, you can put 2 projects on your resume(well technically you can put any project, but proj 2 and 3 were large). That leaves 2 more spots, which you could hit by taking the Web Design or iOS decals, but you&#39;d want to actually be interested in learning them. You&#39;re welcome to put less projects on your resume as well. I&#39;d say focus on 1 project only to add to the resume, since a lot of your time this semester will be spent on recruiting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>OVERALL:</p>\n<p>a. Keep improving resume(maybe build a project to enhance experience, take project decals)</p>\n<p>b. interview prep daily</p>\n<p>c. apply, apply, apply, then apply some more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There&#39;s tons of factors that go into suggesting which of the three options to choose. I think you can definitely get a job without internship experience!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PERSPECTIVE:</p>\n<p>There&#39;s no rule in life that says you have to be employed right after graduation. There&#39;s no rule that says you have to work at Google to be a successful CS major. You can definitely get a job that may not be ideal, work super hard, then level up to your company of interest in 1-2 years. Heck, you may want to travel a year around the world, come back, then find a job.\u00a0Do what you think will make you happy.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6unggda5ox", "updated": "2018-08-30T04:44:41Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/26 - 9/1", "bucket_order": 84, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-08-30T18:12:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jlgvzprs5hd5ur", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>As far as interview prep goes, I found that\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/\">https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/</a>\u00a0is really useful and completely free.
