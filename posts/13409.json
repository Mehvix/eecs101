That was my worst semester grades-wise, and its because there is a very constant heavy workload in both. 170 is conceptually more difficult with (technically) less work, but the problem sets can take a really long time (I would say the same or more time as CS70 p-sets). 61C isn&#39;t as conceptually difficult but it is probably the densest class I have taken in the sense that there is so much material covered and so many assignments. You have 3 lectures a week, discussions, labs (61C labs take longer than 61A and B labs imo), and projects. Studying for either class takes a long time too, 170 again because the concepts are tricky and the exam/HW questions are really hard and 61C because there is so much material and the exams have a lot of &#34;gotchas,&#34; like did you remember that one thing in the corner of the slide # 43 for lecture # 28 or something. It relies more on memory and feels different than other CS courses, for example my MCB roommate was taking some hard biochem. course and we felt like we were taking essentially the same class. That being said, they are pretty consistent in workload throughout the whole semester, so just make sure your other classes are as well. If your other classes surprise you with a bunch of readings or a final project/research paper, you will probably find yourself overwhelmed more than once.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-10-19T20:25:35Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-10-20T07:00:20Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kghmbo73trjnx", "subject": "<p>Is there any drawbacks to pushing back 170?
