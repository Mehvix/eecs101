I did this last summer, from my experience, there are some things that will go wrong that you won&#39;t really be able to fix by just looking at the Decal resources as I assume your project will deviate from what they do. You will just have to end up using google to find ways to fix things when they do go wrong. You will need to use swift or objective c depending on what exactly you want to do. I only used Swift, it&#39;s fairly similar to Python, so it should be pretty easy to get the basics down. Not so sure about objective c.
