Topics include: fabrication processes, material systems, and modern computational techniques for domain specific design, geometric transformations, and algorithmic preparation for fabrication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many new computer controlled machines exist theoretically speeding up fabrication, but yet 3D design remains difficult and fabrication remains manually intensive. Breaking with tradition, this course explores the idea of a shape compiler as well as the application of the declarative design method to the design and fabrication of articulated forms to make design and fabrication dramatically more productive. Shape compilers are software applications which transform a high level design into simple and inexpensive parts ready for rapid manufacturing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The class creates a very interactive setting for learning, with in class discussions and labs comprising of a large portion of the class in addition to the lectures. It&#39;s a fun class on a special topic that is growing in popularity across multiple industries.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Lectures</b></p>\n<p>The lectures and labs cover a progression of building blocks necessary for writing software that describes the fabrication of articulating 3D structures. The class starts by introducing basic geometry and simple CNC machines working from 1D to 3D. From there, the class expands into the notion of time, motion and mechanisms to effectively move shapes through space. A series of lectures chosen from below will be offered on topics relevant to the aim of the course:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul><li>history of digital design and fabrication</li><li>maker revolution</li><li>shape compilers</li><li>declarative design</li><li>constructive solid geometry</li><li>generators</li><li>rationalization</li><li>joinery</li><li>design patterns</li><li>emergence</li><li>design space exploration</li><li>optimization</li><li>analysis</li><li>future manufacturing</li><li>electromechanical compilation</li><li>programmable matter</li><li>self assembly</li><li>assembly instruction generation</li><li>future and easy design</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Readings</b></p>\n<p>Companion readings will be assigned weekly and students will be expected to read them, write a paragraph on them, and report on the reading in a discussion format during the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Labs</b></p>\n<p>A series of labs will be offered throughout the semester to introduce required techniques and technologies, and to assist students in the development of their projects. The labs primarily cover geometry, CNC machines, mechanisms, and basic computational techniques. We cover wire bending, laser cutting, milling, and 3D printing. Students work on labs in small groups. Five late days are available to use at student&#39;s discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Project</b></p>\n<p>A single six week project will guide student&#39;s contributions to the course. In this project, students will study available fabrication processes and material systems in order to develop an &#34;thing compiler&#34;, understood as an automated pipeline that rationalizes a personal sized physical form and produces the data required for analysis and fabrication. The project overall will be developed in collaboration with technicians at Jacob&#39;s design workshop facilities. Students will work on projects in groups of two or three. Projects should include a formal specification and design rationale as well as a demonstration that the design optimizes a specification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feel free to ask any questions!</p>", "created": "2018-10-26T07:45:39Z", "subject": "CS 194-028: Computational Design and Fabrication (Counts as CS Upper-Div)", "uid": "hx22q5r8G96"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jnpppcoxuc82v7", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8101, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548241683, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is7v14a4sx5cp", "name": "Akaash Kambath", "photo": "1537482112_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is7v14a4sx5cp/1537482112_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6vdgnbhgcc2to", "name": "David Yi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hx22q5r8G96", "name": "Shivam Parikh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ib2kjonsu611tu", "name": "Natalie Leuenberger", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6pa4ybkqj1e1", "name": "Neil Sharma", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewdof6ib2pp", "name": "Imaani Choudhuri", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5swigc8gzd516", "name": "Heidi Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is7v14a4sx5cp", "j6vdgnbhgcc2to", "hx22q5r8G96", "ib2kjonsu611tu", "is6pa4ybkqj1e1", "j6lewdof6ib2pp", "j5swigc8gzd516"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "lscs", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 402}
