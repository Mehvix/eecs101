The system checks for open seats twice a day on the primary component waitlist (lecture, for example), and checks to see if there are open seats on the secondary component (discussion, lab, etc) waitlist. If you are first on the primary waitlist and both the primary and secondary section that you have enrolled in are available, you will be enrolled in the class, given that you meet all requirements (such as requirements for the class, enrollment phase, have no holds, etc). If there\u2019s no space in the secondary section you have selected, you will be bypassed and the process will continue to the next person until all primary component seats are filled. Note that your position on the secondary component waitlist does not matter as long as there are open seats in the section.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your chances will be increased if you are at a low waitlist position on the primary waitlist and if there are many open spots in both the primary and secondary components that you have selected.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2016-08-08T19:24:31Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hkvte3b4co34kr"}], "id": "irmffywo3cw3lo", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-08-03T19:25:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>See title.
