Last year 61C was at 8am, so a vast majority of people skipped live lecture (only 30-40 people showed up to the lectures). In general, 61C covers a lot of topics/trivia and hence is not that deep,\u00a0so\u00a0watching webcasts\u00a0is not a loss\u00a0unless you have a lot of questions. 170 lectures had better attendance but having watched\u00a0them live and webcasted I did not find that much of a difference.</p>\n<p>Last semester 61C and 170 midterms were on Tuesday/Thursday of the same week and were definitely manageable. We did not have back to back finals though, so I cannot speak to that part.</p>\n<p>If you had to delay a course, I would delay 61C (as I am biased towards theory). However, if you like hardware/low level stuff though, then do 61C first.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TLDR: 61C &#43; 170 is definitely doable although it will be tough at times, and webcasts are life savers.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "updated": "2018-01-06T20:38:42Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-05T01:13:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["faculty_advising", "lscs", "enrollments", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hey!
