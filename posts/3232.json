For example, I think the course helps more if you apply to GSI a lower-division course (especially CS61A &amp; CS61B) because the instructors can serve as a reference. Faculty contact me regarding some applications, and I can tell them if a particular student exhibited strong teaching potential. \u00a0Outside of those circumstances, I&#39;m not sure how useful it is. \u00a0That being said, you should take the course to learn the content; students regularly report that the curriculum made them better teachers, and I&#39;m hopeful that, over time, this will become readily apparent to hiring faculty--thus making the course even more useful than it currently is. \u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "i08mx67j9Ws", "updated": "2017-01-21T00:54:17Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-20T05:30:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["tutoring", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I realize there&#39;s no concrete answer for this, but I&#39;d kind of hoping to get some general sense of how this should stack up against some other opportunities, in terms of how much the time commitment is worth.
