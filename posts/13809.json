The projects in 161 have very disproportionate workload (at least, in the version I took). The memory safety project that relied most on 61C knowledge mainly required a solid understanding of C buffers/strings/etc. and stack/code memory structure (not even the 61C memory allocation stuff with all the calculations, literally just how the stack looks). That project was the medium-heavy one, comparable to 61C projects in workload but probably more conceptually challenging, and it was actually pretty fun. The heaviest project by far was the file system project for the cryptography portion, and it had pretty much nothing to do with 61C knowledge (we implemented it in Go, but even then most of the work was with paper and pencil, designing the system). The last project for us was in web security and it took less time than the HW assignments. I hear 162 is a huge time sink so it may actually be a nice class to pair with it since most of 161 will not be super time-consuming (except the file system project, you will need to spare some time for that one). Seems 161&#43;162 will be pretty similar to EE16B&#43;61c in terms of workload so if you are trying to avoid that much work, you probably will not with 161&#43;162. It may make it more manageable knowing that 161&#43;162 are probably going to be more enjoyable content-wise and have more overlap in understanding than 16B&#43;61C.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyf20y5pyas38e", "name": "Keeyou Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd0ebjf50lh", "jyf20y5pyas38e"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-12-01T07:17:13Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 11/29 - 12/5", "bucket_order": 27, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-12-01T08:23:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ki5psrrnhb06b2", "subject": "<p>thanks poet for the detailed explanation!
