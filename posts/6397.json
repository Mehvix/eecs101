If a text has no beginning and no end, who decides how it should be read? If a blog is written by a fictional persona, who do we define as the author? Using a combination of print and electronic literature, this course will explore the preceding questions as part of a more general investigation on what it means to be an author in the 21st Century. Throughout the seminar, while challenging traditional and preconceived notions regarding what it means to be \u201can author,\u201d students will use the literary and theoretical works as a means of understanding how to become a more effective writer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">NWMEDIA R1B: Is Technology Evil?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Session D | MTWR | 11 AM \u2014 2 PM \u00a0| Dwinelle 215</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nicholaus Gutierrez</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital Technology has profoundly influenced the ways we live, work and play. From the \u201cdisruptive innovations\u201d of the sharing economy to workplace automatization, from social media to streaming entertainment, the standard narrative of new media and technologies tends to be aspirational: digital networks democratize access, increase efficiency and make life more convenient \u2014 in short, they change the world, usually for the better. But is the reality of this new technological world purely positive or does with it pose some problems as well?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this course, we will practice the skills of college level writing and research by carefully questioning popular narratives of digital technology. Do the mass media make us into zombie consumers? Do social media cause isolation? Do search engine algorithms create filter bubbles that polarize culture? We will think about the role of mass media in the production of consuming subjects, of the representations of race, gender and sexuality in new media, of the nature and role of aesthetics and design in contemporary life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">NWMEDIA 90: Movies and/as Media?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Session A | MWF | 10 AM \u2014 1 PM \u00a0| 340 Moffitt</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kaitlin Forcier</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the beginning of the twentieth century the \u201cnew media\u201d was film: heralded as the artistic medium for the industrial age, cinema became a nexus for anxieties and aspirations surrounding the cultural and social transformations wrought by modernity. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, as moving images migrate to the digital and the medium of film itself is transformed, film provides a productive site for theorizing media at moments of emergence. Moreover, since the very beginning (from technological pioneers such as M\u00e9l\u00e8is, to auteurs such as Stanley Kubrick and George Lucas, to the digital innovations of films such as The Matrix, Avatar, and Gravity), cinema has explored, formally and thematically, what new technologies mean for society.</p>\n<h2>Explore the Wonders of Ancient Egypt &amp; Earn College Credit this Summer!</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-summer-nestud-18-001-lec-001\">From Pyramids to Mummies: Explore the Wonders of Ancient Egypt</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-summer-nestud-18-001-lec-001\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cZLPuJIQTPgYr5I5JY849zA4zb-m3H548W1JC7q1UuzEEu7zDh960nacppw3Jw17pYugxJjtEWk8NAKYNoeLn038Wr-NFWySjbTTHKfEuT5aKEj4Qxz7qdIMFfYhBL1F-XAYYBxp\" width=\"520\" height=\"804\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Apply for a Public Service Scholarship or Internship for next year</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SERVICE SCHOLARSHIPS</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Peter E.

Without CS in high schools, our students are missing out on essential computational skills that will help them succeed in any career they wish to pursue, and professional skills that could lead to an economically secure future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.tealsk12.org/volunteers/\">TEALS program</a> seeks to change that reality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our volunteers work directly with classroom teachers to help them build and grow their CS teaching capacity through yearlong support and training to inspire the next generation of computer scientists. If you\u2019re interested in the opportunity to help shape students\u2019 career opportunities \u2013 all while having fun \u2013 TEALS is the right fit for you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learn more and apply at <a href=\"https://www.tealsk12.org/volunteers/\">tealsk12.org/volunteers</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">RSVP for one of our Bay Area Info Sessions below.
