I took 61C last semester and it took up way more time than CS70 and the rest of my classes put together. 162 as I&#39;m sure you have heard is also a very project heavy course. I do think that it&#39;s doable in terms of workload, but one thing you may want to be careful of is that 162 is reliant on a lot of the material from 61C, so you might find yourself bombarded with new material in 162 at an extremely fast pace. For example, locks, threads, virtual memory in 162 are covered in the first third of the class. In 61c that&#39;s covered towards the end, so people having taken 61c will be at an advantage there.</p>", "created": "2017-01-07T20:57:18Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "ixnpor87jpu357", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijkkwhtybi03q2", "name": "Michael Murphy", "photo": "1505519406_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ijkkwhtybi03q2/1505519406_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ijkkwhtybi03q2"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-07T20:47:55Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi, I am very interested in taking 162 this semester in preparation for internships and was wondering how necessary 61C is for 162. I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions on whether taking 61C and 162 together with a light other course load would be a bad idea or if it would be doable. I am already somewhat familiar with many concepts from 61C and have been preparing for the class all break so it wont be all completely new information, but still very challenging I&#39;m sure. I am also currently enrolled in 188 as a backup plan and I think there might still be space in 170 as well but would really prefer to take 162 this semester if possible as it most aligns with my interests, and would be okay with\u00a0pushing 170 and 188 to the next semester.
