I haven&#39;t taken it but it goes over modern distributed systems. Also, if you want to develop these technologies, you should know the material in 162 (concurrency and synchronization especially) though if it is just to use them, you probably don&#39;t.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since this is a rapidly developing field, you can also learn a lot from reading stuff online about how different companies use things like Kubernetes/Mesos (and Docker), Kafka, and other distributed systems in their engineering blogs. For example, here are the blogs of the creators of Kafka, <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Confluent, </a>and the creators of <a href=\"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">CockroachDB </a>(a web-scale distributed database). \u00a0</p>\n<p>Then you can try out this stuff (for example spinning up toy clusters) on your own projects though you probably won&#39;t reach the scale needed to see anything interesting. If you are interested in developing these types of technologies, most of their associated projects are open-source, and you can also contribute via github or you can do research for someone on campus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can also ask OCF staff members about these technologies. Some of them work as SREs/ Production Engineers and are knowledgeable about scalability and high-availability best practices used at large companies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope that helps!
