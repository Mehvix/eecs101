In the course, you don&#39;t <em>need</em> Math 104 either, as Stat 210A begins with introduction to measure theory. If you have strong math foundation and strong intuition for probability/statistics, not having Math 104 should not be your biggest deterrent.That said, I took the course without Math 104, and I could definitely have used a stronger proof background. But, the course was by far one of my favorites and it really lent me a new lens into looking at statistics! So, my advice would be less on do I need Math 104 to take Stat 210A, but more on what you want more in your final year: learn more mathematical rigor or learn more statistical rigor.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The course is a graduate course, meaning there is little support compared to undergraduate courses. Also, do note that the course is very high workload (some homework can take 20&#43; hours).
