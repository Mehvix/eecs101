However, I just noticed that now\u00a0Vladimir M. Stojanovic and\u00a0Chunlei Liu are\u00a0teaching EE16A, so I was wondering if the fact that the professors changed for the class may change the policy about alternate final exams? I emailed both professors but have not gotten responses yet, so\u00a0I was\u00a0wondering if anyone else happened to know whether EE16A will offer alternate finals.
