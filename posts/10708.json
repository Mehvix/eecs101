You&#39;ll also conduct at least 1 interview with the people involved in the research you&#39;ll write about (often the professor).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Workload:</strong></span> Around 3 hours a week outside class if you do the assignments thoughtfully. Much less than any R&amp;C course, but I personally feel you get a lot more out of it. Obviously the end of the semester might have longer time commitments if you procrastinate on the blog post and news article.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Grading Scheme:</strong></span> Not sure what you mean by this exactly, but for what it&#39;s worth the class is not curved and does not really focus on grades. The course syllabus outlines the exact rubric (point by point breakdown) for every assignment so the grading schemes are very clear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Final Project:</strong></span> The blog post and news article. Optionally, you can choose to make a video instead of the news article. Even though this is technically the final project, all assignments in the course are directly related to this project so it&#39;s not like you have to do the whole thing at the end of the semester.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2019-11-03T04:22:55Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6nu5jrtxc54wd"}], "id": "k2ihpdi9t0x7mh", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idkkuk3zhbm6aw", "name": "Hanyu Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5swigc8gzd516", "name": "Heidi Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idkkuk3zhbm6aw", "jktvex6279x3zb", "j5swigc8gzd516"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-11-01T20:36:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>How is\u00a0ENGIN 185: the Art of STEM Communications?
