You should be very comfortable with 70 material, and you should know your linear algebra extremely well. Concepts in the class are taught with the understanding that you have a strong background and won&#39;t need to see something several times to get it. Concepts will be taught with a bit of the underlying math, and homeworks will drill the underlying math for you. I&#39;d say homeworks are like 8-12 hours a week, with roughly half the time (at least for me) being writing it up (I solve the problems roughly first and am very slow in writing up solutions neatly and w/comprehensive proofs).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-11-09T00:52:37Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-11-08T23:36:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Is 161 &#43; 189 too much?
