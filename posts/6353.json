This is why all students are strongly encouraged to take these courses. In those courses, you will also learn why these concepts are important. So for concrete advice, students who for whatever reason are taking Math 54 (despite our explicit guidance\u00a0to the contrary), are encouraged to follow along in EE16A and EE16B to understand where linear algebraic concepts are coming from and why they are important.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16AB are just the baby basics however (and even they together go beyond Math 54). To get a more solid background, you are encouraged to take the next level of course at the intro upper-div level--- for example, courses like\u00a0Math 110 (for the complementary more abstract perspective, as well as the treatment of Jordan forms) and EECS127 (for deepening the\u00a0connections between linear algebra and optimization, as well as vector calculus). If you have to pick just one, that course would be EECS127.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For most folks, the combination of 16A, 16B, and 127 should carry you pretty far.
