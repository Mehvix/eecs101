I worked on a web app (mostly front end, some back end), but I didn&#39;t receive too much technical mentorship because my mentor was not a front end developer. I had lots of freedom to make the project what I wanted it to be. I had a fun experience there exploring\u00a0the NASA campus and touring Washington DC (other than the humidity/heat). The biggest things I learned were that web dev was not where I wanted to be in the long term (this was pretty valuable insight) and that the federal government was not where I wanted to be in the long term (although I was pretty sure of this prior to the internship).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second internship was at General Motor&#39;s Cruise Automation in San Francisco, and I was referred there by a\u00a0person I knew through my NASA internship (turns out networking is maybe somewhat important). I really enjoyed my time there, and I had a ton of independence on the research-y project that I worked on. The biggest things I learned there\u00a0were what working in SF is like, what\u00a0startup culture and tech industry are like, and that I kinda enjoy\u00a0machine learning problems but that I might not enjoy working on applied machine learning in the long term.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would recommend that you apply to everything that is remotely interesting to you to keep your options as open as possible. You shouldn&#39;t expect to be able to get into any particular company. If you already have an offer from the startup, I&#39;d say go for it if a) you&#39;re interested in what the startup does, b) they offered you interesting sounding work, and c) they seem at least somewhat reputable. By going to a startup over a big company, you definitely give up some things, like the name recognition on your resume, the structure of the internship program (which I don&#39;t think is necessarily a huge minus because you may be treated more like any other employee in a less structured program, which is a good experience to have), and networking with the greater number of employees who have worked at and will work at other big name companies. But if you like what the startup is doing, I think it will be worth it to go.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Free free to reply with any questions</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "ijbyyqoowfj720", "updated": "2018-02-27T03:56:28Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/25 - 3/3", "bucket_order": 109, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-02T00:00:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "je96a8ojz6a6rx", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I knew someone who worked at a big tech company and he hooked me up with my first internship</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-03-02T00:00:21Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-02-27T01:01:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "eecs", "peer_directed", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What was your first internship, how&#39;d you get it, what&#39;d you work on/or either how much work was it and how was the mentorship/how much independence did you have?
