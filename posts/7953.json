The material in 170 is inherently challenging and many people don&#39;t do as well as they&#39;ve been doing in other CS classes. Moreover, mean scores on tests (assuming you don&#39;t improve AT ALL in the remaining 170 tests, which is quite unlikely tbh) usually corresponds to a grade of B&#43; nowadays and that shouldn&#39;t bring down your GPA by a lot, especially since I assume you have closer to a 4 (considering you getting &#43;1.5 SDs on tests). Now if you&#39;re really trying to keep your GPA in the high 3.9s for some reason (grad school probably?), then I personally think P/NP would show quite negatively to admission officers/professors.</p>", "created": "2018-10-19T05:41:44Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_3"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Sorry to hear things haven&#39;t been going well, and I hope they turn around for you soon!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can&#39;t really give an answer from an employer&#39;s perspective, but at least w.r.t. all the professors I&#39;ve interacted with, I think they would probably ask about it, and give you a chance to explain the situation.
