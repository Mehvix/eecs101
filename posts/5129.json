Personally, I think the curve in summer is pretty good compared to normal semesters.

Taking CS70 in summer works very well for me because I got to focus on this single subject just like you mentioned. However, I&#39;ve seen most of the topics before, so I didn&#39;t feel like the class went too fast.
