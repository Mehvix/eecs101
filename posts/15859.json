If you follow along with the lectures, you&#39;ll probably be okay. In this regard, I think he&#39;s better than Prof Ghaoui, so if you do plan on taking 127, this would be the semester to do so, As for the difficulty, his exams are usually pretty fair. The class is graded on a curve anyways, and the material in 127 isn&#39;t really that conceptually difficult.</p>", "created": "2021-10-13T05:03:41Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kup1smqzylq6sz", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-10-13T07:55:53Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kup7y2oxsscof", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Courtade is a great professor!
