First, a bit on the expected workload: I spent 5-10 hours a week on problem sets and a little less for labs, a good deal less time than I spent on 170 (which I took concurrently). This is because the majority of the problems you do in 126 will be computation rather than theorem proving, and what little there is in the way of proofs are formulaic (e.g. epsilon-delta types). In fact a lot of questions on 126 problem sets have a &#34;trick&#34; to them, usually involving some symmetry present in the problems (e.g. different states in markov chains having the same hitting time), and I would go so far as to say that a large part of the course has to do with learning to recognize such shortcuts. You may find the following tips helpful:\n\n1. Continuous probability at the undergraduate level is 10% probability intuition and 90% multivariable calculus. Many problems will require you to do repeated integration-by-parts, and what&#39;s more is that if you&#39;re doing it right, most of these integrals should be recursive! \n2. Finding stationary distributions for markov chains reduces to solving sometimes fairly complicated linear systems of equations. For most of these systems solving for the eigenvectors of a corresponding matrix is infeasible, and sometimes the best way forward is just to try making a linear recurrence relation and solving a couple levels to try and figure out what the solution is.\n3. Many problems later in the semester are basically just the proofs of various concepts with a slight twist. If you read and understand the original proofs, you should have no issue with the problems.\n\nGood luck! 126 is one of my favorite classes I&#39;ve taken in EECS so far, and the material is truly awesome.", "created": "2018-01-10T23:46:53Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jc9psbkbftn7o9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9gar1zyoo", "name": "Murtaza Dalal", "photo": "1514404177_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9gar1zyoo/1514404177_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguxs6dab51fp", "name": "Udaya Jonnalagadda", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrinme4xbt11j", "name": "Jiayi Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp", "is6p9gar1zyoo", "icguxs6dab51fp", "idrinme4xbt11j"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-08T01:29:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>These are known to be among some of the harder upper div classes, what are ways which can help me do well in the class.
