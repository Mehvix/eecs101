No, it&#39;s not (for most people). You said you&#39;re having a hard time managing your current schedule and this plan is heavier. That being said, there are certain upper divs that are more manageable in combination--search the piazza for these or go on HKN&#39;s course guide. E.g. CS184 &#43; 162 by itself would be tons of work while 161 &#43; 162 would be more manageable.</p>\n<p>3. This depends on which you want to emphasize more (SWE or quant. finance?). All of the classes you listed are potentially relevant for one or the other. I would start with taking 61C with 170, which will together introduce you to many SWE concepts as well as algorithmic problem solving and certain important mathematical concepts like FFT. Depending on which class or subtopic of each class you prefer, it will probably be clearer what you want to take next. Also search the piazza as many people have asked questions exactly like this.

If you're taking 20 units, you might want to think about something easier than 170, since 170 can be a difficult class for many.  Data 100 might be better for you if you intended to take that class.  Data 100 has a hard requirement of Data 8, so if you  haven't taken Data 8, you won't get in.  Do note that at some point, you're probably going to do 3 technicals in a semester and most if not all the CS classes either are decently difficult or high workload, or both.  \n\nThe 169A class is only offered in the Fall, and 169L in the Spring, but 169L requires 169A except for certain circumstances.  That's the one class you probably can skip if you're taking an internship since you'll be learning mostly the same things. Although if you're not doing an internship next summer, taking it in Fall 2022 wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, as it would help you with knowledge before going into an internship.</md>", "created": "2021-09-25T18:56:16Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ku05lzp2ks7rl", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1637820614_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1637820614_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["kaddqruc8a45kz", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10664": 9, "12424": 3, "13157": 8, "13281": 5, "14554": 0, "14786": 6, "3810": 7, "5769": 1, "5770": 2, "6947": 4}}, "created": "2021-09-24T06:04:28Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am a sophomore, taking cs 61b and eecs 16b this semester.
