During the fall 2019 semester, I am planning to intern with 2 companies one after the other. My first job will be in\u00a0NYC,\u00a0and the 2nd will be local. I don&#39;t want to have to withdraw from Berkeley for the semester, so I was wondering if anyone has experience taking EECS courses remotely while interning away from campus. Is there any kind of remote proctoring that is supported for exams? I will be able to take finals in-person, but will most likely miss midterm 1s and early midterm 2s. As of now, I&#39;m thinking of taking CS 188, Data 8, and a breadth (already taken: 189, 126, 170, lower divs).
