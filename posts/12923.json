It&#39;s abysmal how the department treats its upper division students with respect to this current policy where it&#39;s geared to prioritizing non seniors. There should be at least an opportunity for seniors to have some number of seats set aside. Freshman, Sophomores and Juniors have plenty of time to defer 16B and still being able to take the class and eventually declare if that&#39;s still to be done with the major. Seniors who are risking not graduating on time due to this uneven reservation policy are seriously undermined in their ability and the department henceforth should strictly re-evaluate its policy concerning EE16B</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-08-18T06:22:47Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/16 - 8/22", "bucket_order": 16, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-08-19T14:06:48Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ke1g9aqwpbt7dr", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Another LSCS senior here (not EECS), even though I have interned for FAANG last summer, and this summer, I still don&#39;t understand why we still need EE16B to graduate.
