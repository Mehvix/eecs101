For 188, there have been ineffective attempts by the professors in prior semesters to try to build a theme / connect the topics together, but ultimately, as an\u00a0intro course to the broad field of AI (like 170 is for algorithms and CS theory). that class also is unable to spend much time in any particular one area. Ultimately, I consider both 170 and 188 as\u00a0more grab-bag-like courses than 70 is. (170 has a reasonable excuse for this: in real life, when you solve a problem and try to design an algortihm, you likely don&#39;t know beforehand what a good approach to solve the problem is.)</p>\n<p>But there are also other courses (e.g. project-based ones where\u00a0you build on the same project as the semester progresses) that are more well-connected topic-wise.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h", "updated": "2017-02-21T11:09:30Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-18T07:40:49Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "izaxq945nl151e", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What about CS70 do you dislike?

I&#39;ve really loved the 61 series so far (they&#39;ve probably been my favorite classes at Cal), so I&#39;m really unsure what to do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Which of these classes are more similar to upper div classes? I&#39;m not sure if I could take many more classes similar to CS70, I find it overwhelming to the point of being seriously detrimental to the point of seriously affecting my general mood/emotions.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What can I do to enjoy the class more? If I dislike 70 this much will I hate upper division classes as well?</p>", "created": "2017-02-18T07:24:07Z", "subject": "Loved 61A, really enjoying 61B, but hate CS70 - Is the major right for me?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "izax4sbblp36vf", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 3404, "num_favorites": 3, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552986980, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"hv91iivr1r15z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hkkimnphegg1lj", "name": "Nick Rose", "photo": "1488156699_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hkkimnphegg1lj/1488156699_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9iqhcexqe", "name": "Janaki Vivrekar", "photo": "1563065131_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9iqhcexqe/1563065131_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8ai11kz766", "name": "Alexander Harrison", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iypaif4n3cw3a5", "name": "Federica Alessio", "photo": "1504816608_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iypaif4n3cw3a5/1504816608_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hkkimnphegg1lj", "is6p9iqhcexqe", "is6p8ai11kz766", "iypaif4n3cw3a5"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 1089}
