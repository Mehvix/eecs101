Of course, linear algebra is a deep subject that one constantly gets better at, and so in 189 you are going to have to work hard. However, this work is doable and you will grow as you do so, assuming you have other technical maturity. (So, 189 is not intended to be taken by a 1st semester sophomore by any means. 189 is a junior/senior course for real. It&#39;s not an entry-level upper-div course.) \u00a0You will know more linear algebra and know it better at the end of 189 than at the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We still recommend people to take Math 110 because the additional abstract perspective is important to understand --- both for cultural reasons and for general mathematical maturity.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>221A is a true graduate course. It is an entry-level graduate course, but for Berkeley PhD students. This means that a well-prepared UCB senior can take the course, but the intensity is quite high. A mastery of 16B is adequate preparation as far as linear-algebra goes (and in fact, other students from other places might have even less than that), but you really need to know more material say from 120, etc. before being able to take 221A.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-04-05T23:26:28Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p><strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gro4nnkuub\">&#64;Elad Alon</strong> \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE 16B is great preparation for CS 189!</p>", "created": "2017-04-05T22:42:34Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek"}], "id": "j15k73j5j0o34h", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idqt1c8i3w778l", "name": "Bilal Shafi Sheikh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"global": 1554662529, "iodbabo3p981z3": 1, "iy2218fmis837o": 1, "jcgyh2gxeeq2i": 1525561791, "jl2h2s08saj10h": 1543962104, "jr82w490pjf3x5": 1556926405}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy040fqd1kp", "name": "Divyansh Agarwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8idxhub7pd", "name": "Daniel Zhang", "photo": "1471923062_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p8idxhub7pd/1471923062_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ib2kjjo3h4u1qs", "name": "Poorvi Acharya", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idqt1c8i3w778l", "icguy040fqd1kp", "is6p8idxhub7pd", "ib2kjjo3h4u1qs"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-05T21:05:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "policy"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Given the recent changes to the lower division requirements, to what extent does 16B cover Math 110 material?
