Taking ME 134/EE 128 concurrently with or before 106b will be enough for that class as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But outside of just these two classes and for knowledge as a whole, 120 is a pretty fun, relatively light workload class that probably won&#39;t teach you anything new controls wise, but might give you more theoretical rigour and will be useful if you plan on doing signal processing related things, like taking EE 123. If you felt unsatisfied with some definitions or formula for laplace transforms, then 120 might help with that too. But, having taken 132, you also have the background needed to self study all the relevant content as well.
