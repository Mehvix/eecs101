Our goal is to make sure that students understand the material and build/reinforce a solid conceptual foundation that will serve them well for a couple of decades of them continuing to learn on their own. We have the advantage of being at Berkeley, where we have the freedom\u00a0to have high expectations (and workloads) as well as being able to count on very strong courses like 16A, 16B, 70, 126, and 127 at the lower-div and entry-level upper-div level, ahead of an advanced undergraduate course like 189. We also have amazing graduate students and undergrad TAs who are able to help craft the kind of rigorous assignments that are required to really understand things. (shortcutting lots of time that would otherwise have to be spent by students, while helping them get a better handle on the underlying patterns)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, there are only 24 hours in the day and so we need to prioritize. We prioritized in a way that we hope that students after 189 will be able to pick up the notes for Stanford&#39;s 229 (or any other intro ML course anywhere), read them, and then be able to cut through any assignment that might have been offered there like a hot knife through butter. The goal of a course is always to make students stronger after they&#39;ve taken it, not to add lines to anyone&#39;s resume.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-01-30T20:28:14Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jd23hwb58b23mx", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j4199ilx2115mx", "name": "Parham", "photo": "1518019944_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j4199ilx2115mx/1518019944_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4vft2wem7ay", "name": "Saurav Mittal", "photo": "1539428202_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6d4vft2wem7ay/1539428202_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100003496029521", "id": "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "name": "Luke Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idvyyvxjglc", "name": "Pedram Pourdavood", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j4199ilx2115mx", "j6d4vft2wem7ay", "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "idvyyvxjglc"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-23T06:48:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>A friend of mine at Stanford is taking their version of 189.\u00a0It seems like we will be spending\u00a0much\u00a0more time covering least squares than they will.
