Just to give some background, I&#39;m also a CS / Math double, who has taken all 3 (54/16A/16B) since I&#39;m a senior who was not required to take 16B, but chose to\u00a0out of my own interest, and have taught 16A/B for multiple semesters ever since.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From my personal experience, Math 54 was an amazing class that taught the necessary Linear Algebra background needed to go into 16B, and is taught at a slower pace than 16A, since 54 doesn&#39;t have to cover circuits. It is a very <strong>theory</strong> focused course, since it is a Math class, but it is still a lower div Math class so it will have many computational questions along with applications sprinkled here and there. On top of that, I think something that people don&#39;t discuss as much, is the fact that Math 54 covers differential equations as well. Linear Algebra is only 2/3 modules of the course. Differential equations are key to 16B, and I think 54 will give you a leg up on other students if you&#39;ve had\u00a0previous exposure to differential equations. My concerns for 54 however, are mainly that it is\u00a0<strong>very very\u00a0</strong>professor dependent. Personally I would only take 54 if it were with Nadler, Srivastava, or Ribet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That being said, I think 16A is a great class on its own, and takes a different, <strong>applied</strong>\u00a0Linear Algebra approach to the material. The core concepts of 54 such as (Gaussian Elimination, Vector Spaces, Eigenvectors, Least Squares) are all covered in 16A, but homework problems and lectures are very motivated by the applications of these concepts, whereas 54 still primarily focuses on building the theory and concepts. In 16A as well, Linear Algebra is only 2/3 modules of the course, and the other module is on Circuits. It is however, a very surface level treatment of circuits, but important concepts such as Nodal Analysis and Op-Amps are key to 16B, and assumed when walking into 16B.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When it comes to preparation for 16B, I think either class will be fine. Math 54 will give a stronger understanding of differential equations and theory, whereas 16A will give an understanding of circuits and applications that 54 did not cover. That being said, I would also consider the fact that circuits are\u00a0not all of\u00a016B since it is only 1 module out of 4,\u00a0since there are three other modules on Controls, ML, and Signals. Therefore, I would argue that having a stronger Linear Algebra / Differential Equations background is much more beneficial to succeeding in 16B. Something else to consider however, is that since 16AB is a sequence, the two courses\u00a0are very similar structurally and 16B\u00a0will assume students have taken 16A, and will sometimes refer back to examples or problems seen in 16A.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an ideal world, it&#39;d be great if students had the time to take all three,\u00a0but\u00a0I do understand concerns that it is one whole course of additional material that is at times redundant. Personally I&#39;d recommend all three, since the concepts taught in all three courses are amazing, and sometimes a concept might just fly over your head without you noticing, so some redundancy can help. Therefore, I&#39;d take the following approach:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>1. Have time for all 3 (54 and 16A together, then 16B with 110 since you&#39;re doubling in Math)</p>\n<p>2. Haven&#39;t taken Physics E&amp;M in high school, or haven&#39;t seen circuits before (16A, then 16B )</p>\n<p>3. Have\u00a0previous exposure to circuits, and 54 has a\u00a0well-rated\u00a0professor (54 / 16B) <strong>(will have to self study DC circuits / Op-Amps, ask me if you need material)</strong></p>\n<p>4. Have previous exposure to circuits, but 54 doesn&#39;t have a well-rated\u00a0professor (16A, then 16B)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhln7qf4679", "name": "James Jung", "photo": "1633737012_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvhln7qf4679/1633737012_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhln7qf4679"], "type": "followup", "uid": "isavdtjxldo7pe", "updated": "2019-10-31T18:08:18Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/29 - 1/4", "bucket_order": 129, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/29 - 1/4", "bucket_order": 129, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-01T03:20:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k4uqgtgmevr515", "subject": "<p>Edit: answered at\u00a0https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=11072</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jr9e54e6ayt2cx", "updated": "2020-01-01T03:20:51Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-12-31T23:09:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k4uhhdwgxd21ya", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I am actually doing the same thing.
