I completely agree with Anon Gear/Mouse/Scale above -- notes are the heart of the course, and if you understand them deeply you&#39;ll have the toolset you need to tackle hard problems. I&#39;d recommend scheduling some time before each lecture to look through the associated note, printing it out or marking it up on a tablet if you have one. Write down tricky concepts or proofs that don&#39;t quite &#34;click&#34; as you go, and keep those in the back of your head during lecture. After lecture go back and explain those concepts in your own words if you&#39;re able to, and if possible think of connections that they share with earlier ideas that you&#39;ve learned in the course. If you&#39;re still stuck, come to office hours and we&#39;ll help you out!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know I&#39;m biased as a TA, but I&#39;ll say it anyway: discussion really helps. Just like in a regular semester it&#39;ll help you consolidate the material, but in an online semester it also helps keep you honest about watching the lectures on time (I taught online last summer and this spring, and sticking to a regular schedule seems to have a big impact on information retention). One general cycle that works for students is:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Read the note closely --&gt; watch the lecture --&gt; Resolve issues you had with the note (possibly with OH/discussion) --&gt; practice applying concepts in discussion --&gt; exercise mastery over concepts in homework/practice exams --&gt; read the next note</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Try to get in touch with other CS 70 students this summer, because talking through concepts is especially key to a deep understanding in the course. JoinMe is a good resource to make that happen with support from course staff.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, I think it&#39;s worth underscoring that some of the topics in the class are really interesting and beautiful pieces of math. At the risk of sounding preachy I do think that you&#39;ll learn better if you go into the class with the goal of understanding the material well enough to appreciate it, rather than simply as a means to an end. That&#39;s not to say that the material isn&#39;t useful in future courses -- it very much is -- but I find that students who attack the material with some curiosity tend to retain it better.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We on course staff are always there to pick up your Piazza questions and emails. 70 is a hard class and it&#39;s going to be tricky sometimes, but our goal is to give you whatever structure you need to push through and get stronger for it. Best of luck -- it&#39;ll be a fun summer! :)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6levisx8i724b", "name": "Kyle John Khus", "photo": "1590613582_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6levisx8i724b/1590613582_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnp6zi7f227d", "name": "Shuyao Zhou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwv9tv79yyn5ok", "name": "Agam Jolly", "photo": "1568868584_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwv9tv79yyn5ok/1568868584_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"k31w9e2vrbk43x": 1586853188, "k5eevxebzpj25b": 1585553070}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzopexwovqq42h", "name": "Tarang Srivastava", "photo": "1566948758_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jzopexwovqq42h/1566948758_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jlpihhme1ha2fk", "name": "Yebin Seo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhwn369f6ik", "name": "Kevin Zhu", "photo": "1578594899_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhwn369f6ik/1578594899_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jycboq1nm0e6ya", "name": "Uma Karki", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1535223700, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1525795138, "j5zp8esecm31rr": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1515461097, "j9j0udrxjjp758": 1519242790, "jjd5ukm1ddp6x6": 1535223700, "jkopvsyuy7g3u0": 1535681645}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j1hge0e6rt9yo", "name": "Alex Kassil", "photo": "1525041329_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j1hge0e6rt9yo/1525041329_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6levisx8i724b", "jzlnp6zi7f227d", "jwv9tv79yyn5ok", "jzopexwovqq42h", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jlpihhme1ha2fk", "jktvhwn369f6ik", "jycboq1nm0e6ya", "j1hge0e6rt9yo"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jjs6h91kq4a1l5", "updated": "2020-06-18T23:20:19Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-06-19T02:37:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Resolving; plenty of good tips below</p>", "created": "2020-06-19T02:37:32Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jydlyk1lid57di"}], "id": "kbllrxle7h42ke", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-06-19T23:49:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kbmv8a64obg3ee", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>As someone who took the course last summer, make sure you don&#39;t get overwhelmed.
