Pretty recently, I found out that I need 2 more units to graduate from L&amp;S.\u00a0This came as a surprise since I&#39;ve been meeting with advisors every semester to make sure that I was on track to graduate, and I was always told that I was good to go with my planned schedule. Luckily, I&#39;ve been mentoring for CSM this semester. I could have added this as a course for 2 units at the start of the semester, but I did not do so because I didn&#39;t realize that I needed the units. So basically, I&#39;ve been doing all the work required to get the 2 units, but I&#39;m just not enrolled. I&#39;m in the process of getting the necessary\u00a0signatures\u00a0for\u00a0the late change of schedule form to add CSM as a course. Can anyone verify that this will work? I just want to make sure I can graduate on time, especially since I have a job lined up after I graduate.
