There was no mandatory homework and the class was just based off of the midterm and final. This might be very different during the summer, but otherwise, the concepts were not that difficult. Since it is probably more condensed as a summer class, I would say if you put in 6-8ish hours a week of solid work (plus doing practice for the final/midterm), you would probably be fine. Since you are doing a full-time internship, I would say have fun with that over the summer, but this might be the annoying thing you have to do while working.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "id1upnr9xbc256", "updated": "2017-03-05T00:13:31Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-28T21:43:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["peer_directed", "cs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I believe this course counts as a tech elective for L&amp;S CS.
