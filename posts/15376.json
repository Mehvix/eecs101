I would add--while acknowledging some tempered bias--that if you wish to get into <em>the teaching scene</em> then CS370 *can* be an excellent and even ideal way to begin. Though there are clearly many, many paths towards excellence in teaching within the department, college and campus as a whole. This course can be one of them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You&#39;ll certainly learn about teaching and learning sciences, strategies, and practices that affect your students&#39; academic outcomes for better or worse--because what to avoid\u00a0 can be as impactful as evidence-based practices that one should do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As mentioned you&#39;ll also tutor students weekly and will receive feedback from said students throughout the semester as well as anonymized peer feedback on entries in your teaching journal. The teaching journal includes what you tried and what did or didn&#39;t work in a given iteration (and more). This allows you to hone in and increase skills in areas that resonate with you, in addition to anything you&#39;re willing to devote effort towards developing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be clear the course is an excellent example of, &#34;You get out what you put into it&#34; in the sense that you can take these strategies and general knowledge as seriously as you wish and the more you do the more you&#39;ll grow--as in any endeavor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end of the semester you will have tutoring feedback from the 1-3 students who developed a learning relationship with you over the semester. The most tangible benefit in this regard is that you can opt having your aggregate feedback rating included in your data when you apply for ASE positions. When you submit your application it will display your feedback rating. This is a likert scale of 1-5 akin to HKN, campus, and CSM ratings; so a strong example might be 4.8/5. When faculty are evaluating who to hire, they have the ability to consider your outstanding one-on-one teaching rating for the given semester, as well as the fact that you&#39;ve been proactive enough to take a 3 unit course on adaptive pedagogy in CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To the point, if you don&#39;t have formal experience yet, but did well in the class for which you&#39;re applying, I find it reasonable to think that having the additional criteria CS370 offers would be advantageous--especially all other things being equal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An added bonus is if you decide to become a TA then you won&#39;t need to take a mandatory pedagogy course because CS370 already meets that requirement--thus saving you the time and potential stress of simultaneously taking a course on teaching while teaching a class for the first time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> In the most basic sense the course provides you with the following: <strong>1)</strong> knowledge about teaching/learning you otherwise wouldn&#39;t have; <strong>2)</strong> regular opportunities to practice implementing that knowledge iteratively with multiple, diverse feedback channels; <strong>3)</strong> the <em>option</em> for your ASE applications to automatically include your overall tutor rating. This rating, in essence, is your students&#39; perception of your instructional practice&#39;s helpfulness, benefit or value to them.</p>", "created": "2021-07-21T00:35:17Z", "subject": "", "uid": "halg8jo1i9m2ye"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "krcr7w5v2e312i", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ks0loxzw8rb6y": 1631593033, "ks2ailfmg2upx": 1630537348}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ksi0n5yl9a867t", "name": "Rebecca Dang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ksi0n5yl9a867t"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "plain", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10929": 2, "11067": 5, "12861": 0, "12911": 6, "13169": 9, "13462": 7, "14370": 8, "14984": 1, "5550": 3, "7496": 4}}, "created": "2021-07-20T03:38:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "I haven&#39;t gotten an opportunity to be a part of the teaching scene yet.
