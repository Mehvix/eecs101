Special topics courses are exactly what they sound like, a professor has an idea of something special they&#39;d like to teach for a semester and offer it in this form. Foundational material courses are really meant for learning the basic concepts needed to pursue further research (although they aren&#39;t that common in CS, my guess is because its still a relatively young field and there&#39;s been no organized effort to stop and think about pedagogy of material beyond undergrad stuff, but that&#39;s just my two cents) such as some of the grad EE courses. Most undergrads will take grad courses of the former variety, and I&#39;d recommend that you check some of them out; if there&#39;s one on a topic that really interests you go for it. If you want tougher, more intensive grad courses related to ML, I&#39;d recommend checking out Stat 210B. It&#39;s not an ML course per se, but a lot of the topics covered it in are important to ML (primarily concentration inequalities and how to use them). However I&#39;d doubt you&#39;d use anything covered in that course in an industry ML position unless its one meant for PhD&#39;s (i.e. a role more about theoretical ML than using it).", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2019-03-22T19:00:58Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-22T02:22:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Are any grad courses worth taking for those interested in industry for SWE or Data Science / industry-oriented ML?
