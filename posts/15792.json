I&#39;m currently taking CS61B and EECS 16A, and I&#39;m struggling with the first few circuits stuff. I&#39;m a bit lost in the class and find the hw in 16A to be a lot time consuming(7-9 hrs). Declaring is my top most priority so I was just wondering is taking 16B and CS70 together along with any American Cultures class a good idea, or should I push EECS 16B to next Fall or push CS70 to summer? Also just in case if I was to push any class to later semesters, can anyone recommend me any easy Upper Division class I can take. Thanks in advance.</p>", "created": "2021-10-05T18:38:58Z", "subject": "EECS 16B and CS70 Together", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kuefe9jkiof4j7", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 15792, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539623136, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "lscs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 316}
