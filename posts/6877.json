So no building database applications. Theres a lot of useful stuff (understanding a DBMS, concurrency/locking, parallelism, SQL, sorting/hashing large files) that you&#39;ll learn which is fairly ubiquitous even if you don&#39;t go into databases.

There are 5 projects/hws which aren&#39;t too difficult and don&#39;t really take up a lot of time (the instructions are usually very good). I usually catch up on material by watching lectures a week before a test and look over old tests a few days before.
