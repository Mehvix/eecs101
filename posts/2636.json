To this end, we will utilize CNMAT externals and sound generators as well as a set of libraries designed for OM that are used to control external sound analysis, processing and synthesis tools, such as Csound, SuperVP, pm2, and Spat.<br /><br />Music 159 will take place in the computer lab and students will develop short pieces in-class on a weekly basis, as well as more substantial works as midterm and final projects. The course will be of interest to any composer of acoustic music or computer music seeking ways to investigate and develop new compositional materials. (OM\u2019s musical editors make this environment particularly useful for this work.) The course will also be of equal value to the computer musician seeking to expand synthesis and spatial audio techniques for musical productions. As a visual programming language built on CommonLisp, OM also offers computer programmers a large potential for powerful control and elaboration of musical ideas.\u00a0 Prior programming experience is not required but students who have not previously taken Music 158 will need permission from the instructor to enroll.<br /><br />Point your browser here for more information on OpenMusic:\u00a0<a href=\"http://repmus.ircam.fr/openmusic/home\">http://repmus.ircam.fr/openmusic/home</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(I assume enrollment isn&#39;t ready yet)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "updated": "2016-11-17T06:59:32Z"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 11/20 - 11/26", "bucket_order": 174, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-11-23T09:45:14Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ivuqv4vfipe59h", "subject": "Does Music 159 count as one of the upper-div classes needed for the CS minor?
