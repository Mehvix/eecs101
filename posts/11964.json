You need to start early on the projs. Otherwise, content is on the easier side for an UD eecs class.</div><div>126: probably the hardest eecs class I\u2019ve ever taken. People in this class are amazing smart.

You\u2019ll need to put in the effort to learn the stuff and study of course, but I definitely didn\u2019t study as hard for this compared to other classes and am doing fine.</div><div><br /></div><div>I\u2019ve always taken 3 techs per semester so this schedule wasn\u2019t really anything out of my comfort zone.

I prefer to take 2 techs per semester, but I need to take 7B eventually. The semester I take it will inevitably have 3 techs, I\u2019m just not sure if this will be the right semester to do it.
