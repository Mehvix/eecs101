I would probably just omit the Sp20 grades from my admittance criteria if all grades were PNP and give you the benefit of a doubt because this is a global crisis and nobody should be penalized for it.\n\nIf you have, say the following grades for Sp20: A, P, P, A-, P, I would assume that you were trying to be clever by only opting into letter grades for the classes you did well in, and PNP'd the classes that you did poorly in--you perhaps were trying to maximize your GPA by taking advantage of the relaxed PNP standards. And for this, I would assume your PNP grades would in fact have been bad grades and you were trying to exploit the situation, which I may inherently penalize you for.\n\nNot saying that everyone who partially PNPs classes is trying to exploit the situation, but this is probably how many readers/admittance people would interpret it. If you just do the default PNP, I think most readers will apply some sensitivity and understanding to the situation, and assume you were impacted by the crisis and not penalize you for that. Whereas if you partially PNP, some readers might either 1) assume you were trying to exploit the global crisis or b) that your PNP grades were bad grades (which is probably true, let's be real).\n\nThis is why I think it makes sense to either take all classes for a grade, or all classes for PNP. And I really don't think it is very likely that readers will penalize you for choosing the PNP option. The readers are humans too and they also lived through this incredibly stressful crisis, so I would be willing to bet that they will have great humility for Sp20 and not penalize anyone for PNP grades.\n\nIf you are worried about PNPing 189 because you want to apply to a masters program, but you are finding it very difficult to perform well under the circumstances, I would just take it PNP and in your application you could explain the situation and why it was difficult for you and why you PNPd everything. If you do that, a reader is highly unlikely to penalize you for PNP, in my opinion. If you are just honest and real about the situation, you probably won't get penalized for it. Whereas if you try to be sneaky and selectively PNP, the reader will likely be less understanding.\"</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgoe0t1k57a", "name": "Kristy Lee", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "name": "Gilbert Feng", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "name": "Rishi Veerapaneni", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvgoe0t1k57a", "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "is6p8c8z13p7cd"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-04-26T02:08:57Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-26T02:34:00Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9gfve3hin37id", "subject": "The class I didn\u2019t do well on is CS188, and it\u2019s a field I would want to enter along with ML, and I don\u2019t really think getting a B&#43; is a good idea for this class(I\u2019m A- now, adjusting to home was really rough and the 188 exams are hard enough).\u00a0", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2020-04-26T02:34:00Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-26T02:37:40Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9gg0446t5461n", "subject": "And on the midterm, did beneath what I need on the final for an A-, that being said I definitely haven\u2019t abandoned the course but home adjustment is very rough.
