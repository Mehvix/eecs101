Like you may have heard, it is too theoretical, especially for a class that is<strong> supposed</strong> to help you with interviews for industry. Just grind leetcode, like you yourself said, with some emphasis on DP, greedy and graph-based questions, and revise 61B concepts (in the context of Leetcode/CTCI, again), and you should be fine on that end. I feel like I fell for the bait that 170 was going to be helpful since everyone around me was echoing the sentiment before even taking the class, when in reality it is anything but.

I think it&#39;s silly that 170 has this reputation that it&#39;s supposed to help you for industry since it&#39;s quite obviously a theory class and as such has no interest in teaching you practical interview questions; that&#39;s not the point. Sure, it&#39;s a helpful side effect and I personally have found it useful in a pinch to have some deeper algorithm knowledge during interviews, but that really isn&#39;t the point of 170 in my opinion. The purpose of 170 is to show you different algorithm designs and have you understand\u00a0how they work through proofs and analysis, so you have some basics in understanding CS theory. While being difficult and a pretty big time sink, I&#39;ve enjoyed the class and would recommend it on the basis of understanding the cool theory ideas that make efficient algorithms.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re planning on taking 170 just because of technical interviews, then I&#39;ll echo the followup above: don&#39;t take it, it&#39;s not worth your time. Most industry positions will probably deal with security concepts more often than they deal with algorithm theory, so 161 is probably a better fit anyways. I feel like 170 is a class most CS majors should take to better understand the theory ideas that support our favorite algorithm designs, but as a senior you probably have already been exposed to these, so maybe it won&#39;t be that useful for you. However, the other thing to keep in mind is that you&#39;re possibly applying to grad school - if I was in your position I&#39;d do some googling or ask some professors/grad students that are in the field you&#39;d like to do research in and ask them what they would think.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-05-09T18:26:09Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 5/12 - 5/18", "bucket_order": 45, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/12 - 5/18", "bucket_order": 45, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-17T02:49:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jvrhijokjstzg", "subject": "<p>Wow thank you professor!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-05-17T02:49:35Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-17T02:39:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jvrh616fxgd76w", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>161 covers a fair amount of networking.\u00a0 There is a lot of detail stuff we don&#39;t get to, but we do speed-run a good 1/3rd to 1/2 of 168 in the space of 2 weeks.\u00a0 And I make sure you get my TCP jokes.\u00a0 I really make sure.\u00a0 And keep repeating the joke until I know you get it.\u00a0 But don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t get my UDP jokes...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, after 61C, 161 is the last &#34;Speed-Run&#34; class: going for a huge breadth rather than depth.\u00a0 If you were comfortable with the breadth for 61C, 161 should be a ton of fun for you.</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "iebai2pv8pu6jh", "updated": "2019-05-17T02:39:51Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-08T06:28:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["faculty_advising", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am a raising senior debating between taking CS 161 or 170 along with 162 next semester.</p>\n<p>1.
