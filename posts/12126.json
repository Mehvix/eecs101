The transition to online learning has impacted my efforts in 126 much more than any other class so I know I&#39;ll have to PNP it. However, I&#39;m not sure if I should PNP my remaining 3 classes or take them for a letter grade. The thing is, I didn&#39;t do great in 70 (got my first B&#43; in a CS course) and I was hoping to make up for it this semester. And so, I&#39;m currently looking at an A in 170 and my two breadths. This is especially important for me since this is my first A in a CS course (got A- in 61A/B/C). Got an A in 16A/B but don&#39;t really think I can count them. I feel 170 being an UD class also helps. Moreover, it would also help overcome my B&#43; in 70.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, I&#39;m hoping to get into research next semester and I feel like having an A on my transcript would be better for my research application then having a B&#43; as my last grade for a CS course.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hence, I wanted to get some advice on whether I should consider taking 170 and my breadths for letter grades and pnp&#39;ing 126, or if I should PNP all of them even with the above situation?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-05-02T23:05:40Z", "subject": "Pick-and-choose for first A or PNP everything?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k9q8ifq9clu3r0", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12126, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654543676896, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j52tu725du07lu", "name": "Arvind Sridhar", "photo": "1585275400_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j52tu725du07lu/1585275400_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j52tu725du07lu"], "tags": ["faculty_advising", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 568}
