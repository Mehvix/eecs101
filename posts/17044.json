This balloon does not stop giving! From now on it will be called Champion.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The balloon woke around 9:30pm last night (pacific time) over eastern Ukraine. Lots of questions have been asked by students:</div>\n<div>Q: Does entering a war zone airspace may lead to its being shot down A: Unlikely \u2014 it is as small as a bird and flying at 8KM high.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Q: Can radar detect it \u00a0A: Yes, but then military radar would be cluttered by signatures from all sorts of small stuff- so these are usually ignored</div>\n<div>Q (asked by a prominent professor) : Can we drop something on Russia \u00a0 A: No</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>During our nighttime, the balloon kept moving, crossing the border to Russia, and is not above the Volga River, half way between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Over the next 24 hours the balloon is predicted to cross Kazakhstan. Looks like it is gaining some headwinds of 80MPh. If it stays alive it is then predicted to go over Mongolia, into China, perhaps cross over North Korea and then Japan. \u00a0Keep you fingers crossed for Champion.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Link for tracking the balloon:\u00a0<a href=\"https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FNU6XB-12&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800\">https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FNU6XB-12&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800</a></div>\n<div>Should be expected to come alive around 9pm tonight.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Our balloon callsign is NU6XB. Callsigns are allocated to hams around the world and represent the station or its operator. NU6XB is the station of the EECS amateur radio club.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Callsigns start with a prefix, which represents the country, then typically a number followed by a suffix.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>US callsigns always start with either N,W, K or A. \u00a0 \u00a0For the US, the number typically represents the state. For example, my callsign is KK6MRI\u2014 and 6 stands for California.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Russian callsigns start with R or U, for example our signal \u00a0was \u00a0picked up directly (not through ionospheric propagation) by station R4ADW. Some countries, will have the prefix be a number.\u00a0</div>\n<div>For example, prefixes 4X or 4Z represent Israel. My Israeli callsign is 4Z1ML. Of course there are some exceptions to the rules.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I\u2019m attaching a callsign map for your enjoyment.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More soon!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>-- Miki</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fbaca13e53c064f242734c97d34d3f44b800eb800212456dc73a09f760e34573b%2F279901848_10160055860007790_207365812467834660_n.jpeg\" width=\"640\" height=\"461\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F57d15f1a88d8e9c264b6fa5ff4c83d9c590067f532aa9be7231482eadc95ac65%2FPastedGraphic-4.pdf\" width=\"396\" height=\"271\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F0b2a7096439a56eb797e9ce5b3c4100b4a4818f786b3958262b8dd502b1bef3b%2Fprefix.gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"438\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>", "created": "2022-05-04T17:12:33Z", "subject": "EECS Balloon update day #15 (!) -- another record broken", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l2ru7vzyce791", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 17044, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538257166, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kprdgnxvvkd3n9", "name": "Arman Kazmi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ksi0nnmoyfi79e", "name": "Owen Thompson", "photo": "1648536349_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ksi0nnmoyfi79e/1648536349_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kshzthi3cka5mh", "name": "Adam Angle", "photo": "1643659602_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kshzthi3cka5mh/1643659602_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kprdgnxvvkd3n9", "ksi0nnmoyfi79e", "kshzthi3cka5mh"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "enrichment_opportunities", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 320}
