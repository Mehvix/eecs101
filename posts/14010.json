Probably 8 short-medium length homeworks and 5-6 Python labs on convolution and sampling (which are very easy). The concepts aren&#39;t fundamentally hard at all since it is a math class about Fourier Transform and Sampling (which is essentially if you want to anything EE related). This class isn&#39;t really a pset based class in my opinion. Take with with Babak if you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>170:</strong> Workload is really just 1 problem set a week meaning most of your grade is in Midterms and Finals similar to CS70. The homework isn&#39;t terribly long (5-6 questions) but they are really really challenging and difficult, which means it takes a lot of time. The difficulty of this class really varies from person to person depending how strong you are in 61B and 70. I found the class bonkers hard conceptually and combined with me enjoying EE over CS, I just pretty much relied on my friends to carry me in homeworks and review sessions in this class to scrap by.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>127</strong>: Similar to 170, workload is really just 1 problem set a week. The homework this semester was only 5 problems with subparts but they are really hard as well. Combined with Venkat being a sub-par teacher, the homework can take 10-20 hours because you are own your own to learn the material. Conceptually, I found it not as challenging as 170 because it relied a lot of linear algebra and transforming problems into different optimisation problems. I got a B&#43; googling my way out of homeworks and my understanding before midterms.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>TLDR:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>Workload: </em>170 &gt;= 127 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 120<br /><em>Difficulty: </em>170 &gt;&gt;&gt; 127 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 120</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jyq487ctcwuk8": 1570760427}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzccssa5qo462l", "name": "Hari Vallabhaneni", "photo": "1580344168_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jzccssa5qo462l/1580344168_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzccssa5qo462l"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-12-27T04:30:50Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-12-27T06:49:38Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kj6rvuflt1m4lk", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Taken 176 and 170</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>170: Agree with everything Anonymous Poet said in terms of workload.
