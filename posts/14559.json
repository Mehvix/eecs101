More importantly, however, 54 is taught by a mathematician rather than by an engineer, and mathematicians and engineers seem to think and talk differently. If you like your mathematics to be simple and lovely and unadulterated by satellites and robots, then 54 is for you; if math feels pointless to you without a focus on applications, then 16A might be more fun.</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "name": "Ritvik Iyer", "photo": "1610929779_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjs6gec3ivg12c/1610929779_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkfrhydzg722h", "name": "Rush Kapoor", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjs6gec3ivg12c", "jktvex6279x3zb", "ipkfrhydzg722h"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-03-18T22:17:24Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-03-19T00:21:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kmfk3yxp12g52v", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Also can&#39;t comment on the upperdivs. I took 54 and 16A together, and 16B after. 16AB curriculum varies depending on who&#39;s teaching it, but as I recall, anything 54 taught that 16A didn&#39;t was covered in 16B with a few extra things thrown in as well (in my semester it was Moore-Penrose, PCA, DFT.) However, I found that 54 and 16A complemented each other wonderfully; it was really cool learning about linear algebra from a mathematician&#39;s perspective/very theory focused vs. an engineer&#39;s/lots of cool applications shown, as Calc said, at the same time. I also found that 54 felt a lot less rushed. So if you have the time in your schedule I&#39;d totally recommend taking both 54 and 16A together.
