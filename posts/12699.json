I then end up getting a return offer and get, I assume, 2 weeks or so to respond to it. now I have to choose between accepting the offer and not being able to see what else is out there for me, or rejecting it and then potentially not getting anything else this season, OR trying to wrap up recruiting for all the other companies I&#39;m interested in in those 2 weeks which is probably impossible (reneging is not an option, I really like the company I&#39;m at and even if I&#39;m shopping around I might want to return to my current company later).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>case 2: I assume I <em>will</em> get a return offer, so I start recruiting very actively now, and try to see what other companies I can get in the final stages of by end of august which is two weeks after I get the return offer. well, then I proceed to\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>get the return offer (sad), and now I have screwed myself over by not taking the time to network and brush up on interview skills before applying / taking the coding challenges (because I was rushing), so I&#39;m in for a less good recruiting season overall. and I don&#39;t have my return offer as a fallback either.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>sorry for the word vomit, I am sure that I am overthinking this but I don&#39;t know what I should do. I heard that some universities have a clause with the companies where they are obligated to extend the deadline to accept a return offer to give students the full opportunity to recruit for other companies during a regular cycle before deciding (something something no &#34;exploding offers&#34;?). when I searched this piazza I see old posts saying that berkeley doesn&#39;t really have a policy in place, so <strong>I want to know if there is an updated page with some version of this policy now or perhaps a person of contact who I can personally work something out with</strong>. I feel like all my issues would be solved if I knew that even if I do get a return offer, I have until november or something to respond to it. please and thanks in advance!</p>", "created": "2020-07-18T20:00:20Z", "subject": "looking for info on berkeley policies about internship return offer deadlines", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kcs2sp2w2g74wt", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12699, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654543038143, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1572839448_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1572839448_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "name": "Ritvik Iyer", "photo": "1568015728_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjs6gec3ivg12c/1568015728_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iw9jrm9iwm56c1", "name": "Michael Lavva", "photo": "1579166933_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iw9jrm9iwm56c1/1579166933_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jis8vl7h4gt6f5", "name": "Rachel Li", "photo": "1539629963_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jis8vl7h4gt6f5/1539629963_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd0ebjf50lh", "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "iw9jrm9iwm56c1", "jis8vl7h4gt6f5"], "tags": ["lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 388}
