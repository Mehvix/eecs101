I&#39;m assuming you are going to be taking 70 in the summer/fall? If so, here are my thoughts:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Execution trumps consumption; reading the notes is not enough, as the 2nd anon below has said. There&#39;s no shortcut- you have to spend a lot of time toying with the material in a variety of different ways. The exact amount may differ from person to person. This is what works for me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I read the notes early in the week, and I go to office hours to help clear up anything I don&#39;t understand. This usually involves sketching out some proofs with the TA- it&#39;s an active, not passive, process on my end. I also start on the homework alone. I answer what I can answer and keep thinking about the stuff I can&#39;t.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I go to every discussion- don&#39;t skip out on these! It gives you two extra hours a week to tackle problems with other people around you- you may find yourself learning about a new approach, or explaining your approach to a classmate. And the TA is there to help clarify anything you feel shaky on or guide you to a solution. Don&#39;t sit in the back, fill in answers and check your phone for the rest of the time. Work with your classmates on every problem in the sheet. Ask your TA for help whenever you need it. They are there for you, you should be demanding their attention. Shoutout to Ben Kha for being a phenomenal TA this semester- he and his section are a big reason for why I&#39;ve done as well as I have.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Later in the week when I&#39;m down to the harder problems, I meet up with friends. We work\u00a0<strong>together</strong>. None of that &#34;hey can you show me how you did this&#34; BS. Get up, pick up a whiteboard marker or whatever and help your friends put together a solution. Stay with them while they&#39;re brainstorming stuff. Don&#39;t be that kid who spaces out for 20 minutes and then asks someone to explain something from the beginning. Chip in when you can. If you see a problem in your friends&#39; solution, tear them apart for it. If you think of something that will help push your group towards a solution, mention it. You should be going back and forth for an hour\u00a0on some problems. Even if it doesn&#39;t get you any closer to a solution, you&#39;re still &#34;exercising&#34; the CS 70 muscles in your head and it&#39;ll be helpful later on.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-04-30T20:38:42Z", "subject": "", "uid": "inzb7blkbzr56q"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>&#43;1</p>", "created": "2017-04-30T19:39:57Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p></p>", "created": "2017-04-30T19:39:05Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>&#43;1</p>", "created": "2017-04-30T19:38:16Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "j253mddtejn4zv", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idkkuk3zhbm6aw", "name": "Hanyu Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p82e9wlk6li", "name": "Annie Tang", "photo": "1536186608_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p82e9wlk6li/1536186608_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ixj56cq4o911qa": 1, "iy7nq0jv6wu1r3": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "itek8117ve07gl", "name": "Yining Liu", "photo": "1528830792_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/itek8117ve07gl/1528830792_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"j6bczj0pmoo4mk": 1512978965}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8z72291ay", "name": "Pancham Yadav", "photo": "1504631008_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p8z72291ay/1504631008_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrikwpr31m46c", "name": "Nithi Narayanan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "name": "Erick Quintanilla", "photo": "1471984816_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/irdxxfmolfj6tn/1471984816_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1570093295, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1550003048, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1570093295}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjm5sqotm026wq", "name": "shoumik", "photo": "1570879757_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjm5sqotm026wq/1570879757_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idkkuk3zhbm6aw", "is6p82e9wlk6li", "itek8117ve07gl", "is6p8z72291ay", "idrikwpr31m46c", "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "jjm5sqotm026wq"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/30 - 5/6", "bucket_order": 151, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-30T19:40:09Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j253osul9sc6vi", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Still unresolved</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-04-30T19:40:09Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/30 - 5/6", "bucket_order": 151, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-30T20:11:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j254t9rm3082b0", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Being in the class this semester, I can assure you that simply reading notes is not really enough (it gives you a false impression that the topic only goes that deep when in fact you&#39;ll explore it at a much more rich level in discussion/homework).

The following strategy is the basic one that works: (In order)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ahead of lecture:\u00a0PRINT OUT THE NOTES. Read them and use a pencil to make marks on the notes. Put question marks where you don&#39;t understand or are confused. Write questions in the margins. If you are understanding, try to work out the examples and proofs on a separate piece of paper after reading them. Don&#39;t copy, but just reconstruct after reading. But it&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t understand something. This is still before lecture after all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ATTEND LECTURE AND PAY ATTENTION: ask questions about the things that you don&#39;t understand. Take notes using pencil and paper in a notebook or on a pad.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After lecture: go back and look at the notes again. Are your question marks mostly resolved? If not, spend some time re-reading and thinking about it. If they are still questions, you really need to bring these questions with you to discussion section.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PRINT OUT THE HOMEWORK. Look over the homework and ask yourself if you can do each problem or at least know how to start. If possible, start in on the easier problems at least. Make marks on the homework printout to indicate your thoughts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ATTEND DISCUSSION SECTION AND PARTICIPATE. At appropriate opportunities, ask about the questions you still have regarding the notes.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have access to the online problems, do them. Make sure you understand the very basics. If you get stuck somewhere, go back to the notes and read them. If you are encountering a difficulty that you can&#39;t overcome, bring this to your study group later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Really attempt to do the homework on your own. Spend about 3 hours solo. Try each problem, but if you get stuck, concentrate on writing out potential approaches that you could try, even if you are not sure they will work. Try to formulate the problem mathematically and take some steps if it is not already formulated in that way. If it is formulated in that way, take some steps without worrying about whether these are getting you to the answer just yet. You need to explore. Don&#39;t bang your head against the wall for more than 15 minutes on any one problem or problem part without moving on. It is important not to have any distractions: this means, no texting, no Facebook, no videos playing, etc... Just concentrate on the homework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meet up with your study group for another two hours for the first group attack. Explain to them where you are stuck. If you are actually not stuck, but just ran out of your 3 hours, then it is fine to work solo side by side for a while. Ask them for their thoughts about the problems. Share your approaches and listen to them. This is the point at which you can also teach each other the concepts and techniques that they have questions about. Brainstorm angles of attack for a problem. Then sit and try to do them on your own for a bit. Then return to a group dynamic. Set a 30 min limit for banging your head on any particular problem or problem part in one go. \u00a0Explain the relevant parts of the notes to each other as you teach each other. It&#39;s alright to joke around with each other, but don&#39;t use electronic distractions when studying as a group.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Attend HW Party and continue the study group dynamic above, except now, you can also ask TAs and tutors for advice. Between HW Party and a second study group session, you should aim to have sketches of solution strategies for every problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Go back and write up all the solutions on your own. (Again, no distractions. Although in this phase, if you want to take a short break after finishing a question, go ahead.) Ideally, you would write the solutions to the problems without any reference to your notes from the study groups --- that is, you would rederive them based on your improved understanding. If you get stuck, consult your notes. Then start on a fresh piece of paper without your notes again for that problem. In general, spending 12 hours per homework total on average (during regular Fall or Spring) is a reasonable amount. With bursts that go higher if something is more challenging for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Come up with your own problems and share them with your study group. Variations on existing problems is fine. Ask yourself if you can come up with problems that exercise specific concepts. If you can&#39;t come up with a problem or a variation on a problem, you probably don&#39;t understand the material as well as you need to.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the solutions come out, read them carefully. Once again, printing them out is probably a good idea. Understand the way that the solution approached the problem, even if your approach was different and also correct. After you read the solutions, look over your own approach. Did you actually get it right? To what extent? If you got it wrong, redo the problem without reference to the solution. If you can&#39;t do it without looking at the solution, you clearly have a gap in your understanding that needs filling. You need to read the solutions before starting the next homework set. Don&#39;t put this off even if the course doesn&#39;t force it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The research on education is clear: taking notes on paper/pencil is superior to typing. Having the ability to spread notes out spatially on a desk or the floor allows you to keep more context in your visual field --- that isn&#39;t possible unless you have multiple tablets even with a tablet-based system.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember, every single thing in the lower division is something that you need to master.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-05-04T21:06:12Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I&#39;d be curious to hear the instructor&#39;s perspective <strong attention=\"giw1lvgzQSy\">&#64;Satish Rao</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong> \u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-05-04T17:28:51Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek"}], "id": "j2aorctmx5l701", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "inzb7blkbzr56q", "name": "Andrew Lee", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hv91iivr1r15z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "name": "Ross Teixeira", "photo": "1414220212_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hkkhvv2dy9f4kl/1414220212_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1543510871}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy1wju20nkf12p", "name": "Celena Chang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijj65y73ymb5i", "name": "Amy Mendelsohn", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "name": "Logan Howard", "photo": "1471912865_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hccnzx9ezt97j7/1471912865_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "name": "Erick Quintanilla", "photo": "1471984816_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/irdxxfmolfj6tn/1471984816_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["inzb7blkbzr56q", "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "iy1wju20nkf12p", "ijj65y73ymb5i", "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "irdxxfmolfj6tn"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-30T00:43:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "cs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Can someone recommend strategies to excel in CS 70?
