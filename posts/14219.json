It's a good idea to confirm the criterion for correctness before writing your solution because sometimes there are ambiguities that aren't in the problem statement. If you can state your solution as an implementation or variation of a common algorithm, such as BFS, then that's helpful.\n\nFor design questions, it's a good idea to walk through an example of input/output behavior, like how the input would affect the output. If you're asked to debug something about a system, start listing off problems that you might experience with the given system. In general, it's helpful to say out loud some of the important considerations in designing your system.\n\nI cannot comment on the behavioral portion too much as I don't have much experience with it (only had 1 behavioral interview which I passed), but in general don't be overly awkward and speak carefully (i.e. think thoroughly before you speak)</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bffcvhw93tq", "name": "Masha Bondarenko", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke2bffcvhw93tq"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-01-17T23:32:20Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-17T00:03:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "cs-intended", "peer_directed", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Not prep advice but practical advice during the interview.
