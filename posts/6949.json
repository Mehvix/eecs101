In my opinion it&#39;s really a mix of statistics and computer science, with some linear algebra thrown in. The Berkeley that I knew (keep in mind that was &gt;30yrs ago) would have been very open to a student adapting the curriculum to suit his own interests. My gut tells me a properly managed CS curriculum is inherently worth more than a degree in Data Science, but a DS degree may be more marketable right now just because it is fashionable. When I was reviewing intern candidates for SWE positions at PayPal and Uber the DS majors we saw were Masters or PhD candidates. Some of them were very qualified for SWE positions and will have a bright future at these companies. There were others who were more versed in theory but couldn&#39;t code. The latter was a problem. The biggest challenge for DS today is that they weren&#39;t usually taught how to collect and process the data on their own. Usually DS relied on someone else to manage the data for them and that is very limiting, and I&#39;ve been reluctant to hire DS candidates who cannot demonstrate the ability to manage their own data. That means a well rounded DS candidate should have data management skills (e.g., physical modeling, query language, python, hive, map-reduce, etc). Hope this helps.&#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So really,\u00a0employability for Data Scientists comes down to how well they can code. I just have to hope that cal&#39;s DS allows the option of erring heavily on the CS side.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-05-08T04:26:53Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-07T03:32:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "cs-intended", "eecs", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Looking at the course reqs, it seems like the requirements between the two majors are quite similar compared to the other backup majors(e.g- cs61A/B 170 186, etc).</p>", "created": "2018-05-07T03:32:32Z", "subject": "Would the new Data Science major work just as well as CS for software engineering jobs?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jgvoxbjoffd3wv", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6949, "num_favorites": 3, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549289058, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5hem67wo1y6sn", "name": "Taj Shaik", "photo": "1562563643_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j5hem67wo1y6sn/1562563643_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jgvlc3c0gux2vw", "name": "David Lu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100003496029521", "id": "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "name": "Luke Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j5hem67wo1y6sn", "jgvlc3c0gux2vw", "hyw7jbf3qk2160"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "lscs", "other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 543}
