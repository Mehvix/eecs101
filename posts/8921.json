I was wondering if there is a 3rd course I could add that is not too heavy and also useful for industry. I have a list of courses I would like to take but they all seem a bit heavy to take with 170 and 149, this is the list: 127, 162, 189, 161, 186. I\u2019ve heard people say that 120 is a good course to take and that it is useful for both cs and ee but I\u2019m also interested in 188. So my question is what course could I take with 170 and 149? Would 127 be too heavy with those? And, is 120 actually that helpful ?
