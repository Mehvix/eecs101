Although they like students to declare their first semester, they typically block students once they reach 90 units and are undeclared. They also had a blocking-like process for undeclared students at 75 units in the old system, but IDK if that&#39;s still the case.</li><li>Keep in mind that if you delay declaration, you will also delay preferred enrollment in the upper divisions. If you&#39;re graduating in two years, this would mean only having priority enrollment for your last semester.</li><li>Yes, you could choose to delay CS 61B until the summer, however keep in mind that the course will move much quicker. If you take your last pre-req in summer you would submit your application during that term.
