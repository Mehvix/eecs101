I have completed all lower division courses before my gap semester but haven&#39;t worked on CS at all since then. So I am wondering which two out of 168, 170, 186, 188 should I take for my first two upper div courses? I saw that 162 is a prereq for 168 but I heard that people\u00a0do not need 162 to take 168. Is it true?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-04-19T00:23:15Z", "subject": "Choosing two out of CS 168, 170, 188, and 186", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j1o8in27tm06u2", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 3899, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552379805, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 523}
