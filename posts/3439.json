Implicit bias takes form in the subtle stereotypes or judgements that we hold about groups of people. For example when we don&#39;t see many women in STEM fields, both at student and professor levels, we believe that its because women are less qualified or may not be smart enough to pursue those fields in great numbers. This notion carries forward in how we interact with women in these environments later on, as our first impression of them may be subconsciously clouded by this idea we have.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So while a female professor may be just as, if not more, qualified as her male counterpart, perhaps the individuals interviewing her had their perspectives colored in this same way and didn&#39;t take her as seriously because she was a woman.\u00a0Representation is extremely important, not only for other girls to see so that they understand that STEM isn&#39;t just a field for guys, but also because it helps\u00a0fight against the idea that only certain groups of people are qualified to do something.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So no.

Immediately, when you see a female in tech, especially a stereotypically attractive and feminine woman, you judge that\u00a0she&#39;s less competent than a man. Intelligence and competence are highly associated with masculinity. Beauty and brains don&#39;t go together.

And this is made\u00a0worse\u00a0by the relative lack of female leaders and role models in tech. Girls grow up thinking they don&#39;t belong in tech, and this is why they choose other, more stereotypically feminine careers such as medicine or nursing, over tech. This is why there are programs to encourage females to stay in tech. Because technology plays such a large role in defining how our society works, and diverse perspectives are needed to help shape society.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please open your mind to perspectives and experiences that aren&#39;t yours.

And as for working hard: there&#39;s no affirmative action for SAT scores or GPA, and Berkeley does not practice affirmative action in admissions. I myself got the test scores needed to get into Berkeley with a scholarship, despite having a weak educational background (my formal education ended with the second grade), then the GPA needed to declare the CS major and the skills needed to get research positions and an internship. How did I work any less hard to get where I am than any of those white/Asian males you&#39;re talking about in your last paragraph? Do you still want to imply that all of them are working harder than I am and I&#39;m still just playing the victim?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second of all, when did I ever say that women and underrepresented minorities are the ONLY ones who can be disadvantaged? I&#39;m Asian-American myself, so I definitely aware that there have been cases of racism against Asians in tech (see the U.S. Department of Labor suing Palantir for anti-Asian discrimination, and Trump&#39;s top advisor, Steve Bannon, saying that there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley, when in fact Asians are underrepresented in management \u2014 and you&#39;re still advocating for re-electing Trump?). I also know that many Asian-Americans come from impoverished families with parents who may be refugees or who haven&#39;t even completed high school degrees, and that people of all genders and races can come from poor backgrounds with lack of educational opportunities. I&#39;m not saying that if someone is a white/Asian male, they automatically face 0 problems, ever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, as a white/Asian guy in tech, you will never get comments from your coworkers about what you&#39;re wearing, or messages from your boss harassing you for sex. You will never get coworkers telling you how unfair it is that you get a &#34;vacation&#34; when in fact you&#39;re taking maternity leave to have a child. You will never get your classmates or GSIs assuming that you&#39;re less competent, ignoring what you&#39;re saying, interrupting you to tell you things you already know,\u00a0 and asking you whether you&#39;re sure you&#39;re in the right classroom, just because you&#39;re a girl in a dress. You will never look around the room and feel like you&#39;re the odd one out and like you shouldn&#39;t even be here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is it true that some women and underrepresented minorities don&#39;t make it in tech because they&#39;re not interested or don&#39;t work hard enough? Definitely. But are you really going to say that white/Asian males just naturally have <i>so</i> much more interest and <i>so</i> much better of a work ethic that it&#39;s the ONLY reason why they make up the majority of tech? If you think about it, wouldn&#39;t it be more logical to conclude that there are also other factors at play \u2014 such as gender/racial biases, feeling unwelcome in tech, and some races being statistically more likely to be disadvantaged than others?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, whether or not the majority thinks &#34;my group is underrepresented in tech so hire me though I&#39;m not qualified&#34; is the right way to go (and how do you know that&#39;s true; where are your statistics?) \u2014 I don&#39;t care. My opinion here is that no one gets a free pass. Everyone has to work hard if they want to succeed. But what you&#39;re failing to recognize here is that it&#39;s not a level playing field. It&#39;s not true that everyone has completely equal chances of succeeding, and that if someone doesn&#39;t succeed it&#39;s always because they didn&#39;t work hard enough, and never because of other factors. I&#39;m not devaluing hard work. I&#39;m saying that we need to acknowledge these inequities exist and take steps to solve them, so that every person&#39;s hard work can be properly and fairly recognized.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_13", "updated": "2017-03-13T04:26:08Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/12 - 3/18", "bucket_order": 277, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-13T07:10:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j07rrxzx1xz6pm", "subject": "<p>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_28", "updated": "2017-03-13T07:10:34Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/12 - 3/18", "bucket_order": 277, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-15T07:54:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j0ao87b81ma5iu", "subject": "<p>&#43;1, you tell &#39;em :)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_36", "updated": "2017-03-15T07:54:33Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-27T00:19:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "izncx3elka04pr", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>To OP, and to the other posters who share the same attitude:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m an Asian woman who is double majoring in CS and Physics.</p>\n<p>After reading OP&#39;s post and all the follow-up responses, the one thing that was most hurtful to me was the attitude that this was not an important issue.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul><li>&#34;This is a non-issue&#34;</li><li>&#34;We have so many more important things to discuss&#34;</li><li>&#34;I have not heard a single student complain about diversity in EECS&#34;</li><li>&#34;I don&#39;t know of a single EECS major who has acted condescendingly towards another student based on his major&#34;</li><li>&#34;This issue doesn&#39;t affect me and most CS students&#34;</li><li>&#34;Somehow they still find a way to blame and play the victim card&#34;</li><li>&#34;Most students want the department to focus on the problems that actually exist and affect our education rather than solving politically correct problems which aren&#39;t actually problems&#34;</li><li>&#34;Lack of diversity is not a problem&#34;</li><li>&#34;Don&#39;t waste town halls&#34;</li><li>&#34;We could be talking about something CS students care about&#34;</li><li>&#34;I, and most CS students, would rather not waste the chance on safe spaces/playing victim card/dividing people by race, gender, sexuality&#34;</li><li>&#34;We don&#39;t have town halls on the issues EECS students care about, but we have town halls on this.

What percentage of the people you know in CS/EECS are also white/Asian males?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Have you stopped to consider that perhaps the reason you and the people you know don&#39;t think this is an issue is because you and the people you know are not the ones who are affected by gender/racial issues in tech?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How many women and underrepresented minorities in CS/EECS have you gone up to and asked, &#34;Have you ever felt unwelcome or not included in CS/EECS? Do you think there are gender or racial biases in tech?&#34;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m definitely not saying that you need to 100% believe without question anything a woman or underrepresented minority is saying. However, your attitude here that, &#34;I&#39;ve never experienced or heard of it, therefore it does not exist or is not important,&#34; is very hurtful. In addition, how do you know that &#34;most CS/EECS students&#34; don&#39;t care about this? Where are your statistics? And for those saying that, &#34;this issue doesn&#39;t affect me and most CS students, so why are we talking about it?&#34; - if something is wrong, don&#39;t we need to act on it regardless of whether it affects 1% of CS/EECS of 100% of it?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I, and many of the women I&#39;ve met, definitely think there are gender biases in tech. I&#39;ve personally experienced several times my male GSIs or classmates assuming that I&#39;m less competent because I&#39;m a girl. I&#39;ve also heard women who worked at famous tech companies such as Amazon and Apple talk about how they would get comments from their male coworkers about pregnancy, about what they were wearing, and comments calling them aggressive. In addition, if you want an example of sexism in tech profoundly affecting someone&#39;s career, you only need read the recent blog post written by the Uber engineer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Often, women and underrepresented minorities are also at a disadvantage because they are discouraged from pursuing STEM or lack the well-funded schools or college-educated parents that would allow them to take advanced STEM classes before college. Do you really think that everyone is on completely equal footing and that the lack of women and underrepresented minorities in tech is really &#34;just people gravitating towards fields they&#39;re interested in,&#34; as one poster put it? As opposed to, say, people getting discouraged from pursuing CS/EECS because they feel unwelcome or biased against by other people in the field? Or because they are coming into Berkeley without any coding experience and without the benefit of the strong STEM background that others might have, and end up not being able to keep up?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the issue of merit, I agree that if one person is clearly more qualified than the other, the less qualified person should not be hired over the more qualified person simply due to gender or race. I also want to be taught by the best (Though, if two applicants for a TA position are about equally qualified, would it be so bad to choose the woman/underrepresented minority since they would be able to provide a unique perspective? Does having a different perspective which allows them to relate to the experiences of other female/underrepresented minority students, and enrich the perspectives of all students, not count as a teaching strength as well?). I am not suggesting that &#34;let&#39;s have qualified people, but also add women/minorities even if they&#39;re not qualified,&#34; as OP put it. I agree that if there is a shortage of more qualified women and underrepresented minorities, we need to instead focus on fixing the shortage problem - which is why it&#39;s so important that people recognize that many women and underrepresented minorities are not pursuing CS/EECS not because they simply aren&#39;t interested, but because they feel unwelcome in the field, or didn&#39;t have the educational opportunities they needed to succeed in the field. The first step to fixing the shortage is recognizing that this is in fact a legitimate issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, why are you assuming that people are completely unbiased and fair when judging a person&#39;s merit? Studies have shown that science faculty view male applicants as significantly more competent and hireable compared to female applicants with identical applications (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract\">http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract</a>). In the example OP brought up regarding the female student suggesting including a woman on the interview board, it&#39;s not black and white. It&#39;s not that our only options are to have an all-male board, or to add an unqualified female. Have you considered that perhaps there is a qualified female student in the organization who could be added to the board, and that she isn&#39;t on the board because gender bias caused the board members to view her as less qualified then she actually is, or because the board members tended to recruit their male friends? Not saying that this is in fact the case, but how can you be sure that they judged the merit of 100% of the members in the organization 100% fairly?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, I just want to say that I agree with a lot of the points you all brought up. Most of the people I&#39;ve met in CS/EECS have been great people. Hiring should be based on merit - though merit is often not judged fairly, and being able to provide a unique perspective could be considered meritable as well. Students should be able to vote on topics for town halls. Budget/waitlists is a very important problem. However, I don&#39;t understand why you felt the need to dismiss gender/racial issues in tech, which, even though they may not affect you personally, are very important as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am not, as OP is saying, &#34;complaining &#39;my group is underrepresented in tech so hire me though I&#39;m not qualified&#39;&#34; because I don&#39;t want to &#34;do the work and get the job fairly.&#34; I think the fact that I came into Berkeley with no coding experience and a weak STEM background due to lack of educational opportunities, but am now a CS and Physics double major with research experience and an internship offer is enough to prove that. What I am saying is that pretending that there are no biases at all and everyone has completely equal chances of succeeding in tech and anyone who says otherwise is just playing the victim card - that&#39;s a very hurtful attitude, especially to those who are affected by these issues. I <em>am</em> one of those affected by these issues, so I hope reading my post and hearing my perspective may have changed your views somewhat.</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_13", "updated": "2017-02-27T00:19:16Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-27T01:03:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Different town halls have focused on different topics.

If you get to use a noisy channel repeatedly to communicate a single Gaussian random variable, how does the performance scale with linear approaches? What scaling can you get with nonlinear approaches?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The issue of course offerings and increasing the TA budget have already been discussed. There are things being done trying to resolve this and fundamentally, those are about getting campus to give faculty slots and TA money to the department. Inclusivity, on the other hand, is incredibly important and had not been discussed nearly enough. EECS values inclusion. Language like &#34;victim card&#34; and the like might seem like mere rhetorical flourishes to some of you, but such language and behavior acts as a way to exclude many people. Humans have feelings and are social creatures. Exclusion/inclusion is not some third-order effect for systems of interacting humans.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Optional technical exercise, in case simple decency of being inclusive isn&#39;t enough: when one is designing a control system that has multiple state dimensions and dynamics that couple them, is the optimal control strategy going to be to only consider the dimension of the state that you care about? Why or why not?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The rigor of thinking that the EECS department wishes to inculcate in its students is not limited to questions involving software or circuits or devices or mathematical models that we give you. The goal is for you to be able to think critically and rigorously about problems in general. One of the important principles here is not assuming that everyone else is a fool. It&#39;s alright to not understand something. That&#39;s normal. You might question something because it doesn&#39;t make sense to you. That&#39;s also good. But to jump from there to assume that the people in charge are in the grips of something nefarious like &#34;Political Correctness&#34; isn&#39;t logical. It&#39;s arrogant. *Humility* is a vital attribute for engineers. Approach questions sincerely. *Arrogance* can be fatal in practice. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is good that you appreciate your TAs. And it is good that you have high esteem for your faculty. But you should also have some trust that these same good TAs and faculty are trying to achieve something when we want to understand how to improve inclusivity. Just because you have not experienced something doesn&#39;t mean that it does not exist.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-02-27T01:03:53Z", "subject": "", "uid":

Just like the ol&#39; days.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perverse Incentives to Lie.</p>\n<p>I like to think of this the same way I deal with cheating as a TA/Instructor. My experience is that most people don&#39;t cheat, and most cheating doesn&#39;t tip the scales in a significant way. Regardless of whether you add race or gender to the mix, what we&#39;re talking about is people cheating an application system. People can (and do) do this already. However, the question is about prevalence and the how effective the cheating is.\u00a0Most people don&#39;t lie, and those who do lie about their race or socioeconomic status or fabricate essays for college were probably not as strong of applicants to being with. I also very much fundamentally believe that most \u00a0people are well intentioned and not evil. That helps me stay grounded at times..because:</p>\n<p>People lying to gain an advantage is a real problem. Turns out, for a nominal sum of cash (say $1500) it&#39;s pretty easy to get certified as having ADHD. Aside from the access to prescription drugs, this enables people to unfairly apply for disability accommodations. 150% time on a test can certainly be an advantage when you&#39;re not using it to overcome a disability. The result of this, is that getting accommodations can be excessively difficult. It took nearly a year (and letters and phone calls from my parents to many people at the College Board) to get approved, and they still eff&#39;d up my SATs and AP tests many times.<br /><br />So, the consequences of these actions are real. To me, the solution is that if you find someone is lying or cheating, you punish them. When it comes to race (and even more so, gender identity) is can be difficult and touchy to verify, but if a company has a problem that is so bad to the point where they need to take these measures, I think they can communicate with applicants about their process. I would much rather see process try to adapt to be equitable, and then correct their mistakes instead of trying nothing at all. \u00a0In my view: if an application asks for a gender, and it&#39;s progressive enough to even include an option for transgender, I just can&#39;t fathom that many people (I just say it...) are fucked up enough to co-opt the incredible struggles of the trans community for their own gain? I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t happen, but until it happens on a big scale, I personally think \u00a0the impact that you make by being equitable would outweigh the potential costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, the other option is to change the incentive structure. Getting a job will always have a high financial incentive to it, but I think it just means that we have to adjust the process to lower the stakes. I read that the average American now has 10 jobs before they&#39;re 40. This hopefully means that landing in the wrong first job won&#39;t be such a deal. It&#39;s part education and part process change that I think can ultimately solve the problems.\u00a0<br /><br />On programs that are only for a certain race or group:<br />I don&#39;t personally have strong feelings about these overall. My personal belief is that the more we interact with others not like us, the more we will collectively understand each other better. However, programs that cater to a specific demographic and be extremely successful. In the space on early-CS education there are a number of programs such as CODE2040, Black Girls Code, AppCamp for Girls, Level the Playing Field Institute. These programs are, in part, able to achieve success by simply removing the racial, gender, economic and other tensions so so they can focus on their goals of teaching \u00a0programming. \u00a0In think internship and scholarship programs that are structured the same way are also a necessary component of progress. They give people opportunities they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have. And in terms of resources, I don&#39;t think those programs typically take away spots from everyone else - I think they&#39;re more of an additive thing. Like &#34;we&#39;re going to do this extra effort because we believe in this case&#34;, such that if not centered around a gender/ethic/etc issue, then there wouldn&#39;t be a replacement program.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "grqtsu85iy0", "updated": "2017-03-04T07:47:24Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/26 - 3/4", "bucket_order": 279, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-04T21:47:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "izvs4q89zu6sz", "subject": "<p>Michael, thank you for writing such a detailed answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would disagree that the programs you mention remove racial/gender/economic tensions.

However, I sincerely doubt that these programs do increase racial, economic or other divides in a meaningful way. Why is OK to group &#39;disadvantaged&#39; into one large group or to not consider race? I would agree that socioeconomic status is probably a better indicator of disadvantage, but it&#39;s so intertwined with race, that I don&#39;t think it matters much in aggregate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But furthermore, &#39;disadvantaged&#39; is a catch-all term, like marginalized that captures dozens and dozens of different disadvantages. While the blind and visually impaired have instances of discrimination and microaggressions, they&#39;re not same struggles that black youth, or Latinxs, or any other group face, even though they&#39;re in a similar category.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Specific programs give people a place to share and grow and hopefully include support without the discomfort of needing to explain to others the struggles they&#39;ve encountered. For example, while I would\u00a0to teach CS at many of them, my presence would be an active distraction for many of the students.<br /><br />If as a society, we segregated ourselves all the time, in every way, then you&#39;re right that&#39;d we probably be in a worse position overall. But programs that address a specific group aren&#39;t designed to replace people&#39;s interaction with others - they&#39;re a temporary. Someone who goes through an internship targeted at women, will almost certainly be working with and interacting with and possibly\u00a0even dating men then or in the future. Additionally, people are intersectional, I don&#39;t believe that individuals in these programs see themselves as only that adjective.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally-- the the quote &#34;people don&#39;t see race&#34;. People absolutely notice people who don&#39;t look or act like them.

What do you think when you walk by a homeless person, or see a group of African American dancers on BART, or someone using a red and white cane, etc, etc? Some of these things you and I probably think are normal, but\u00a0for some of them we\u00a0have instinctive reactions we probably don&#39;t even notice.

I&#39;ve presented at a faculty retreat, met with the chancellor and have spent a lot of time with faculty and staff talking about culture, climate, TAing and education. I am a slightly above average height white cis-gendered male from a stable family raised in a moderately affluent town. I had the full support of parents to attend school, but also received some financial aid. I wear metal framed glasses and shorts, and based on all this I could so incredibly easily disappear in the sea of CS students. I like that actually, there&#39;s comfort in being able to disappear. However, I also have a somewhat hidden and certainly not very obvious disability- I&#39;m very visually impaired. It affects things you wouldn&#39;t expect. <br /><br />I have since graduated, but continue to work part time with Dan Garcia on CS Education projects and have lunch with faculty.<br /><br />That&#39;s probably the most important bits, and far too long, sorry. <br /><br />---<br /> To the OP: What you feel is natural and understandable. I&#39;ve been there too. You are not wrong that waitlists and the pressure to graduate on time and take courses are real and important struggles. We all face them too. I am not going to try to quantify which of these issues are most important. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to - because there are no good objective ways to measure the relative size and importance of these issues. People are all affected to different degrees by these issues, and even if based something solely on a survey, we can&#39;t ignore issues that receive less votes -- they deserve time too regardless of their nature. <br /><br />On the particular aspect of dealing with course sizes and waitlists: Rest assured that your concerns are understood by everyone, and there is not a day that has gone by in the past few years where faculty and staff are not concerned by this issue. <br /><br />Diversity and inclusion are not merely about being politically correct. When a group is marginalized, it&#39;s important to make a conscious effort include marginalized groups and individuals otherwise you end up with a tyranny of the majority. This is not always by direct actions of the major, but simply by indirect privileges that come from strength in numbers. (In some cases, i.e. Slavery, internment camps, disenfranchisement and voting laws the actions are actually very explicit...) When only one Black student walks across the stage at graduation, we need to make sure we&#39;re aware that they aren&#39;t the only black student who was capable of studying CS. Under this logic, I am very much agreeing that the UC Berkeley Campus as whole would benefit from having more politically conservative students. As much as I really do despite the current Republican platform, we benefit from the ability to discuss with and learn from differently minded individuals. <br /><br />As a TA, I relished the opportunity to speak with and indeed learn from from students who brought view points I&#39;d never considered. Some of these were senior english majors comparing CS to writing, others were women sharing their general college experiences. I&#39;m not going to totally address the importance of diversity, because this is long enough, but there are numerous reports about &#34;the business case for diversity&#34; that provide a good starting point. Furthermore, we can&#39;t blame a lack of diversity on individuals or on external factors. At some point, this has turned into the &#34;pipeline problem&#34;, which ultimately comes down to family choices and circumstances of upbringing, and since no one can control those - blaming the pipeline leads to the logical conclusion that this is no one&#39;s problem to solve. No one has ownership of the pipeline, because we&#39;re part of the collective pipe-circle (?) of life. Many studies have shown that the reason there are less women in CS fields is not because they are less interested, but that they self-select out due to various cultural reasons. These women (or young girls in many cases) show interest in science long before they choose another field.<br /><br />These town halls are important, because these issues that are being described have been prevalent for a long while. They are now coming to a head because I believe there is a critical mass of marginalized individuals. In my 5&#43; years, this was the first time I&#39;ve seen a discussion as large as this, and one that is sincerely interested in making progress. In my own experience, the number of students with disability accommodations in CS is way lower than you would expect based on campus statistics. I&#39;ve had many remarks made to me about accommodations giving me an unfair advantage despite there being legal mandates and procedures which are (for the most part) internationally consistent. (Not all accommodations are, but mine are fairly standard.) Yes, I got 1.5x time on exams and sat in a different room. Usually. No, it&#39;s not as glorious and you think, and no you most certainly do not want to specifically schedule every freaking exam. Nor do you want the SATs to take two days, for example. I&#39;m grateful that faculty are accommodating and in most cases willing to learn. But it&#39;s an uphill battle. Sometimes it&#39;s far easier to just forgo any legally mandated accommodations and pretend to be normal, nasty headaches or lower scores be dammed. <br />I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m complaining, but I&#39;m not trying to. My visual impairment is very manageable and even the awkwardness that it does impose could be far worse. My point is that most people cannot see this.<br /><br />I cannot see, nor can I truly understand all the struggles that some people may go through to attend Berkeley. It may be the many additional jobs (for which my lazy ass probably couldn&#39;t handle), or it may jus be the way that others are treated by their peers or something else. <strong>It is entirely within our control, however, to create a place where these factors are mitigated and where we learn to address them. </strong>This doesn&#39;t mean affirmative action necessarily, or any particular policy - but by doing nothing would be systematically harm a bunch of different individuals in a bunch of different ways.<br /><br /><br />As a point of clarification: As it stands right now CA Prop 209 passed by voters in 1996, an anti-discrimination law, forbids affirmative action policies by higher education institutions. (Among other things). So, yes, considering race for admissions is currently illegal. But, consequently, allowing discrimination is also illegal. While I&#39;m not aware of any codified department policies that would constitute illegal discrimination, I do believe that we have a social culture which allows such actions to continue. We have course policies and course designs (both implicit and explicit) that can lead to unintended discrimination.<br /><br />It&#39;s also simply unfair to equate improving diversity with lowering bar. Many of the (often small) gains that STEM departments and tech companies have seen in improving diversity are not through changing standards, but simply doing more to reach out to and search for groups that are typically not included. We can go to black students, or disabled students, or women or whomever and say &#34;I think you might enjoy computer science. It&#39;s a really interesting subject that you probably haven&#39;t had a chance to explore, but here&#39;s why it&#39;s awesome. If you like it, I want to make sure that we&#39;ll do what we can to make sure you feel like a part of the community.&#34; It might feel like awkward special treatment at first, but the goal isn&#39;t to do this forever, necessarily. The goal is do this until we have an equitable community. The reason accommodations for disabled students exist, is to level the playing field - so to speak. Many of the marginalized groups come from backgrounds where they never had access to computer science, for any number of reasons. Though not a physical or learning disability, a lack of access to the traditional support structures is very much a handicap in one&#39;s education. If we believe that discrimination is immoral, then so would it be immoral to not address these systemic problems. <br /><br />At the end of the day, some of these resources we are talking about (such as time and money) are finite. And if we are talking about moving money from one student org to another, you&#39;re right to be concerned about the opportunity costs such a move would present. In the case of funds, I think there are two things consider:<br />a) every financial allocation is a different story, a different beast with different trade-offs. It&#39;s not worth too much effort considering the abstract case here, because the implementation is vitally important. There are outcomes which might benefit everyone in unexpected ways.<br />b) On principle, if we assume that money is to be spent in a way that is equally beneficial to all students, then we need to examine whether we are currently achieving that goal. Some folks have very clearly demonstrated that existing structures (a la HKN) do not support their needs -- and they are just as much entitled to XYZ as we are to HKN.<br /><br /><em>Edit: The last section was eaten by\u00a0Piazza.
