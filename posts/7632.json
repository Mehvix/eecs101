Undergraduate Laboratory at Berkeley (ULAB) is a STEM education startup that gently introduces new students to research at Berkeley as well as provides a social/mentoring experience for advanced undergraduate researchers to learn from each other and develop professionally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ULAB is looking for student researchers for their Data Science Lab to develop and execute independent data science research projects. We are looking for students with an interest in Data Science. Classes like Data 8 are strongly recommended, or any basic data science skills. Students will learn how to conduct research in a professional group setting, along with basic lab networking skills. Students should be willing to commit 4-5 hours per week. Specific work hours are flexible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested, please fill out this Google Form.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/3i65TnssYYvpDAEh2\">https://goo.gl/forms/3i65TnssYYvpDAEh2</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more information regarding ULAB and applications, please visit the website at <a href=\"http://ulab.berkeley.edu/\">ulab.berkeley.edu</a> or email inquiries to nehav&#64;berkeley.edu.\u00a0Thank you. </p>", "created": "2018-09-18T02:49:20Z", "subject": "Undergraduate Data Science Research Opportunity", "uid": "j6mlc0ribwz3d3"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "jm74dwvl9uj5op", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7632, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548604074, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jco46dbav86l4": 1521782523}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "itq8vftgnlo5ol", "name": "Mike Lawrence", "photo": "1540075074_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/itq8vftgnlo5ol/1540075074_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["itq8vftgnlo5ol"], "tags": ["announcements", "cs-intended", "lscs", "peer_directed", "research", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 356}
