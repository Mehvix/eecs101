Yes the math and material you&#39;ve seen before through some other classes which could even be more complicated or harder, but 16B really forces you to think through the perspective of engineering. Why are these choices/decisions made? There&#39;s the design aspect that is not taught through other classes in topics such as Phasors and Filters, or controllability matrix through the perspective of minimum norm.

I know there is a lab component, but I have already seen all of the mathematical concepts. For reference I will be a senior next year and I have already taken all courses required for the math major, as well as math 202A-B (analysis) and plan on 250A-B next semester (algebra). Also for the circuit stuff, I have taken many physics courses, including 5B&#43;5BL (electromagnetism &#43; lab). If this is not possible to waive the course, could I take a more advanced class that would satisfy this degree requirement?
