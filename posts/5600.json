Unfortunately, funding and the building or new classrooms has not kept up with the increase in student interested in EECS. Staff and Faculty do a lot to try to accommodate as many students as possible, including writing grant proposals to industry partners to acquire more\u00a0TA funding. We know it&#39;s frustrating.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it looks like you prioritized three non-EECS courses for your phase 1, and the course you tried in phase 2 is already at 70% capacity.
