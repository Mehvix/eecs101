It will be a little difficult to compile a list of all the data structures and algorithms you need to know for 170, but I can do that if you wanna try studying them over a week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, more important than just knowing these data structures and algorithms deeply understanding the point of each data structure, which you only get by writing some code for each data structure, through 61B homework and projects. As Anon. Mouse pointed out above, it may be possible for you to do if you study up on 61B material on your own far in advance. But IMO, it&#39;s just unrealistic to be able to study so much material in so little time and get a deep enough understanding to be able to fully follow all 170 material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, just the first couple of lectures of 170 is going to go over asymptotics and runtime. Though these lectures are relatively easy to follow, even they assume some intuition from 61B. And this intuition only builds over a few months of taking 61B, as you follow along with algorithms and data structures and understand why runtime matters and how it is connected to data structures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For this reason, I would (personally) strongly recommend NOT taking 170 concurrently with 61B.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As far as interview questions are concerned - I think it would be far more useful for interview prep to take 170 after 61B for 170. The point of 170 is not to memorize common algorithms. It is to help build intuition for algorithmic thinking and optimization, which only comes after understanding 170 material deeply.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the same time, 61B material also helps a lot with interview prep. Understanding what the use case for each data structure is, and the advantages of one data structure over another is one of the most basic things you need to have down for interview questions. In my experience, 61B was way more necessary for interview prep than 170. Because once you understand data structures, you can use your own creativity (in addition to practicing questions leetcode, etc.) to find algorithms to problems. 170 just helps you refine that algorithmic intuition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So I think taking 61B before 170, and prioritizing just 61B, is the way to go if your goal is interview prep. And if you really want to get started on interview prep early, I would recommend starting with leetcode.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke0lmltpadt7ci", "name": "Jonathon Webster", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke0lmltpadt7ci", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jyl6vrdwz3u6ag", "updated": "2021-08-25T09:44:16Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 8/22 - 8/28", "bucket_order": 21, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-08-25T10:15:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ksrcd2t5kdj6d0", "subject": "<p>Also, I just checked that 61B is not enforced as a prerequisite for 170.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke0lmltpadt7ci", "name": "Jonathon Webster", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke0lmltpadt7ci", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "jyl6vrdwz3u6ag", "updated": "2021-08-25T10:15:39Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/22 - 8/28", "bucket_order": 21, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-08-26T03:41:05Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kssdpin6fcgu5", "subject": "<p>meh ive been on course staff before and I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to have taken 61b before.
