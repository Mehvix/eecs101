If you&#39;re graduating this semester (Fall 2014), and would like to make sure you&#39;re clear to graduate, please feel free to book an appointment as well.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><b>2. IF YOU ARE A CONTINUING STUDENT:</b></div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Please use the link below to register for\u00a0one of the faculty group advising sessions.\u00a0 Sessions are filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so I highly recommend that you register immediately.\u00a0 Because we are experiencing an unprecedented surge in majors, it is entirely possible that the sessions before your Phase I appointment will fill quickly; please act accordingly. \u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>IMPORTANT: If you do not register for a session in time for your Phase I appointment, then you will have to register after your Phase I begins. There are NO exceptions to this and we cannot provide an advisor code until after you have attended a session.\u00a0 It pains me to see students miss their enrollment period and have to wait for a later session, so\u00a0<i>please</i>\u00a0be proactive.\u00a0 There are two sessions this coming Thursday; beat the crowd and\u00a0<br /><br />System idiosyncrasies: While we are working on a new, superior system, please keep in mind that this system is dated and has some issues.\u00a0 PLEASE Write down/take a picture/print your session time and location because there is no way to check later (except to email me and this doesn&#39;t scale well).\u00a0 Also, please register just once.\u00a0 Sometimes students accidentally register for multiple slots which adversely affects your peers. \u00a0</div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\"><a href=\"https://buffy.eecs.berkeley.edu/PHP/lscsugrad/startup.php\" target=\"_blank\">Register for a session here, now!</a></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\">OTHER COMMENTS (missing sessions, double majors, and triple majors):</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\">If you miss or don&#39;t register for a session, and are unable to at a later time, you will definitely miss your initial Phase I window.\u00a0 Make-up sessions will not begin until after ALL faculty advising sessions have concluded (no sooner than October 29 and possibly much later); please don&#39;t find yourself in this situation. \u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:&#34;arial&#34;\">Double majors will receive two digits of their advisor code from each of their two major departments.\u00a0 To repeat, you&#39;ll receive half of your advisor code from us and the other half from your other major.
