Since your question about\u00a0OP&#39;s proposed schedule\u00a0was already answered (i.e. its fine), it may be good to chime in for others reading this that double majoring comes at a greater cost than one thinks (money wise its around $20-30k in units and about a year of your time, considering one who doesn&#39;t double major, who is willing to take medium semesters and who isn&#39;t really interested in classes from a bunch of different departments/learning a language/etc.\u00a0can easily graduate in 3 years). This is significant, graduating early is smart for a lot of people who really don&#39;t want to take those other classes and who want to get industry experience asap. Double majoring forces you into the other option of taking the full 4 years and often longer, and you still don&#39;t get to take any of those other misc. courses (unless you\u00a0want to have\u00a0around 20 units a semester). Double majoring has a lot of stress involved too,\u00a0since every major has at those least 1-3 required courses that\u00a0one\u00a0isn&#39;t really interested in but has to take, and this might just get shoved to your sr. year when you may already be starting to regret doing the double major.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am personally double majoring (so don&#39;t think i am totally against it) only because my freshman/early sophomore year i found myself often not being able to do my CS homework because I would go to main stacks to do a project and end up just spending the whole time reading books on the topic I&#39;m double majoring it. It got to a point where it was hurting my ability to do CS as\u00a0much as I could before, and that&#39;s when I realized I really wanted to do that other topic and not CS (I am still in CS though, since honestly its kind of a shame to drop a CS major at berkeley, and since its such a good program and there are infinite possibilities for how to apply CS to other fields CS makes kind of an exception, Haas isn&#39;t the same way though). Anyway, sorry if it sounds like I&#39;m trying to dissuade you, I am really not, but like Atom said above, I wouldn&#39;t be super hasty to do it unless you like highkey like business more than CS or only saw CS as a supplement to something else, or your job/grad school\u00a0really required your diploma to say Haas on it (i\u00a0personally can&#39;t think of anything like this).\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwv9nnux6wn2gv", "name": "Kendrick Sharpe", "photo": "1570492206_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwv9nnux6wn2gv/1570492206_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwv9nnux6wn2gv"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-04-07T18:04:57Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/5 - 4/11", "bucket_order": 42, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-10T03:13:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k8tm8leqfv16qf", "subject": "<p>op here, thank you so much for this well thought out response.
