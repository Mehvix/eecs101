Firstly, I am wondering if 126, 61C and either 16A or 188 will be too much work. If so, I&#39;ll be taking 16A, 61C, and 188 instead. For choosing between 16A and 188: I haven&#39;t started the 16 series yet but since I am currently in 110 my friends tell me 16A shouldn&#39;t be very difficult. My older friends advise me to take 188 because it doesn&#39;t have a high workload but will help me figure out what I&#39;m interested in. Not sure what to do ):</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve taken 61A, 61B, 70, 53, and 110 so far in terms of relevant technicals. Currently, I&#39;m taking 70, 61B, 110 and I have a significant time commitment to my fellowship (10 hours a week) and I&#39;m also involved in a different club (~5 hours a week).\u00a0110 has been more of a struggle because I had almost no prior exposure to linear algebra before, but I&#39;ve been doing okay after I caught up in the beginning of the semester. I&#39;ll probably make A-&#39;s if I&#39;m lucky, B-&#39;s if I&#39;m not but I&#39;m really sick of having no free time this semester so I&#39;d like it if my next semester wasn&#39;t so work work work in general.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ALSO, what should I phase 1?
