This is because 61C teaches you low-level programming/C, and quite a few jobs require that you know it (or C&#43;&#43;). There are also a lot of concepts that are relevant if you&#39;re going for software internships, like cacheing and parallelization. However, 170 and 61C together will be hard and unless you think you can handle it, I&#39;d say not to do it. 170 has weekly problemsets (~10-15 hours), and 61C has projects pretty regularly (on the order of small-medium 61B projects). This is because you won&#39;t get to engage with the 170 material as intensely. I didn&#39;t take 170 with 61C, but took it with another hard upper-div stats course, and felt I didn&#39;t understand it as well as I should have. Depending on whatever suits you- if you like programming and want to balance out your CS/Philosophy load, then 188 might be nice, or if you&#39;re really into philosophy, go for 12A.</p>", "created": "2018-12-24T07:40:51Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I recommend CS 188 or Philos 12A for your third class. 170 is great for internships.
