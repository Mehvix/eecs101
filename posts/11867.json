I&#39;m an alumnus who had a very similar experience to you because I too had (1) another major which I did much better in (economics), (2) felt bewilderment as to why I was underperforming on exams, (3) test anxiety, (4) lots of units every semester, and (5) had a tough time in the 61A/B. All together, it&#39;s a frightening mix, but it can be solved. Let&#39;s break down how to improve things in three stages: before the exam, during the exam, and after the exam. <strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>it&#39;s important not to try to nail all of these habits down at once. Pick up one habit, master it, and then move on to the next one. It took me most of junior year to incorporate some of the things mentioned below. If you can master two a month, that&#39;s pretty good.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before the exam:</p>\n<p>-Understand the tradeoffs in your schedule. You&#39;re going to have minor bumps in your GPA if you add &#34;easy&#34; classes, as I know you&#39;re trying to improve your GPA. If you know what you want to do for graduate school, narrow your focus on neurobiological classes and experience. I don&#39;t think any double major will require you to take 18-20 units a semester, so something tells me that you can hone your focus.</p>\n<p>-Attend lecture. Professor Dragan in CS188 often quoted that people who attend lecture have ~30% better retention and understanding of material. I only learned this my senior year, but I didn&#39;t feel lost in even the most confusing of classes. In a similar vein...</p>\n<p>-Develop routines. It convinced a night owl to start sleeping before 2 and to feel refreshed when hiking all the way across campus for my 8AM. Even during quarantine, when everyone&#39;s sleep schedules are out of wack, try to maintain a consistent sleeping routine because you can.</p>\n<p>-Review lectures within 1-2 days. I wish I could say I did this consistently, but my roommate can vouch for it. <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-memory-techniques-for-long-term-remembering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> is the retention rates of memorization. The way I looked at it is you could either (a) spend an hour now to understand a difficult concept or (b) spend 2-3 hours understanding a difficult concept a couple weeks from now. That&#39;s a pretty solid return on investment.</p>\n<p>-Develop a study schedule and stick to it. Start studying maybe a week in advance, so it doesn&#39;t feel like a crunch. A solid study schedule, with a one day buffer before the exam, prevented me from falling into panic mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Test yourself when it matters least. If you don&#39;t think you understand a concept while studying, quiz yourself then and there. You can either learn the material before the exam, or during it (can&#39;t say I fully remembered the Regex rules from CS61B...)</p>\n<p>-Express any questions or concerns with TAs, professors, or on Piazza. Same reason as the above point. You learn faster collectively, and when I lived in OH during CS189, I picked up mistakes I was making that I couldn&#39;t have predicted until too late.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During the exam:</p>\n<p>-Do the easy stuff first. Plain and simple, all points are weighed equally, and you can build momentum.</p>\n<p>-Remember your first cause while spiraling. I&#39;ve spiraled during exams. My thought process went from &#34;This is hard&#34; =&gt; &#34;I don&#39;t know this&#34; =&gt; &#34;Everyone else around me is writing vigorously&#34; =&gt; &#34;They must know the answer&#34; =&gt; &#34;I&#39;m gonna fail&#34; ...and so forth. I&#39;ve spiraled, just like anyone else. But what you can practice is what\u00a0<em>caused</em> you to spiral. It&#39;s because you didn&#39;t know the problem. Which leads me to...</p>\n<p>-Take it back to first principles. This is a tree problem, what are similar ones I know? How were those solved? What general strategies were used? Chances are, you&#39;ve learned how to solve something similar, and there&#39;s an underlying lesson in each similar problem: use recursion, think of the base cases, can we memoize our results, and so forth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Write down what you do know. Don&#39;t waste energy trying to organize all your strategies and thoughts. Write down leads or ideas you have, so you can at least demonstrate partial credit.</p>\n<p>-Clock management. I had poor clock management because I would wrestle problems in order. You have to know when to move on or not. This is best practiced by locking yourself in a room, simulating test conditions, and timing practice exams. All of this comes with practice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the exam:</p>\n<p>-Remember how you did via clock management and where studying helped and hurt you. Hindsight is useful for improving mistakes. &#34;The definition of\u00a0<b>insanity</b>\u00a0is doing the\u00a0<b>same thing over and over again</b>, but expecting different results.&#34; -Albert Einstein</p>\n<p>-Review your mistakes for final exams and interviews. Try cataloging them, as one could do with Leetcode or general algorithms problems.</p>\n<p>-Understand the big picture. I&#39;m still not a great test taker, but I&#39;m still able to land interviews because I don&#39;t get asked about my GPA much. As for graduate school, someone who has applied can give better advice than me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6e9lx8x7gb1uy", "name": "Shaviv Hoffman-Lowitz", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jlpihhme1ha2fk", "name": "Yebin Seo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhs0v5c944c", "name": "Richard Privalov", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6e9lx8x7gb1uy", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jlpihhme1ha2fk", "jzqdhs0v5c944c"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-04-17T19:05:04Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/12 - 4/18", "bucket_order": 50, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-17T19:11:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k94kj6ti3n42of", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I\u2019ll share some thoughts from my own experience in a technical major (not EECS/CS).

Ultimately I decided CS wasn\u2019t for me because I didn\u2019t enjoy it and only worked hard because I worried about my grade/future, rather than out of interest.
