Just part-time was incredibly draining and took extensive time management and sacrifices. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s probably not the best idea unless it\u2019s a situation where you have no choice\u2014e.g. you have to work to pay for school. Working part-time would be a better option; school is more feasible. I found it incredibly rewarding and I learned a lot.

Readmission after withdrawal is not automatic, and I have no idea what the processes are for an international student. There are also requirements, specific to college and department, regarding what you may take in a term. You may not be able to take all PNP classes. You may also be able to petition for a reduced course load for reason of employment, but usually they require you to prove financial need to work.
