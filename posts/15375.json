We were fortunate to get an Active Learning room which has more materials and resources for classes such as ours.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>What is CS370?</strong></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>CS370 is our course on adaptive teaching in CS which meets the mandatory course requirement for TAs--though it can be taken as early as the semester following your completion of one of the following: Data8, CS10, CS61A, or EE16A. This is a 3-unit course on teaching that can be taken as P/NP or for a letter grade.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>The course is designed to be highly interactive with everyone participating in designing materials and resources to help you as a tutor, mentor, and/or TA\u2014also, most of the material translates effectively to other contexts in industry and academia. CS370 emphasizes adapting your teaching techniques based on student feedback and data to optimize for student mastery of material.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>It&#39;s also equity-oriented which means you will learn how to apply different instructional methods and assessments to address factors that can disproportionately affect certain student populations over others.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Unlike CS375/EE375 this course is 3 units and requires tutoring each week (1-3 hours per week depending on your potential course staff roles; most non-TAs complete 2-3 hours per week). This is often one of the favorite components of CS370. </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>If interested in a more detailed description, please read it on the application website.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Thank you and please spread the word to those who might be interested!</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>PS Email me at cthunn@berkeley.edu with questions; just put CS370 in the subject line.
