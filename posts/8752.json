However, I also would love to further my studies. After some time of researching, I found MENG program in Berkeley and in some other schools are a great fit to me. As they are more industry-oriented, only one-year and help you strengthen your skillset and knowledge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 However, now is near the time to apply, I find that I am lacking one crucial recommendation letter. I believe that I can successfully secure two recommendation letters from my two internship experiences. But I never once have the opportunity to do research with faculty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 I&#39;ve been keep improving my skills and applied to URAP for the past 3 consecutive semesters, and got rejected every time. I&#39;ve been emailing many professors I took class with, and barely got an reply. The class in always so huge here and sometimes I have to wait in line for a long time before I can speak with a professor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 There is only one semester left until application to graduate school. I find it impossible to find a research opportunity to get a valuable recommendation letter. I think I can find a TA who knows me well to write a letter for me. But with thousands of students applying for a program, hundreds of them with strong recommendation letters from a faculty, I find the odds of being accepted into my ideal Master program nearly zero.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Under the circumstance, should I give up on applying to graduate school? I have a relatively strong resume and two previous internship experiences. While it is hard to get a job as soon as you graduate, maybe it&#39;s worth trying?
