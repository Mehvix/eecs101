So basically the reason you haven&#39;t heard great things about it, in my opinion stems from the disconnect between the assignments and what you learn in class. In lecture you&#39;re taught things like typography and color theory, and in discussion they talk a little bit about android. But then they give you these crazy android assignments (hw 2 used like 4 or 5 different APIs and interacted between the phone and watch). People spend so much time getting SOMETHING to work, so there&#39;s like no time to focus on anything design related when it came to the homeworks because the points were mostly in the functionality of the hw. To be fair, the TAs really made an effort to improve the experience of the class from fall 15 and spring 16 and it really helped. The watch code would have been so hard without their help. I guess the best way to describe the class (in my opinion) is like a semester-long hackathon where you learn android. It&#39;s a hackathon because you basically teach yourself android and then make something (an app that&#39;s a group project). If you get a good group, then it&#39;s really cool. I had an amazing group and loved what we made.
