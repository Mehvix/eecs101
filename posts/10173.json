First half of semester was ok because you have slip days, but I used all the slip days in the first half and the second half of semester was horrible... Weaver&#39;s 61C is a lot of work, trust me... The projects are hard and office hours are like 1 TA with 100 students waiting. The first projects in C were really hard and you are unable to finish them without going to OH. The last project was in Go, which was nearly impossible to debug by yourself. Imagine a semester with all Hilfinger styles&#39; projects and due once every two weeks. Shewchuk&#39;s 189 was less work than 61C actually, but the coding homework in neural network took a lot of time, since training neural network takes\u00a0hours and you need to try many parameters to train it to achieve the accuracy. I dropped 153 because I had no slip days left that day the neural network homework was due and I bombed the exam without reviewing, and I think 161 is more work than 153.
