Just because you are unable to get the grades needed to declare CS truly DOES NOT mean that you are not cut out for a career in software engineering or any computer science-related field. I learned that I actually had a lot to contribute in CS organizations on campus or in internships, often outperforming my peers even though they were declared (they did better grade-wise in those classes).
