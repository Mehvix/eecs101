I think you should talk to faculty or doctorate students if you can.\u00a0The only way I could begin to get a sense of the kind of thing I wanted to commit to doing (I&#39;m sure\u00a0are well aware of the kind of a commitment financially, physically, mentally a PhD is), was to talk to people who had been through it and had a good sense of the people, programs, and research involved. Just applying is a process on its own, but since you have been doing research you probably have at least the acquiring LoRs, some connections, people, etc. component down. Make sure you consult with your faculty connections if you have them, or make them now as much as you can. The professors I&#39;ve spoken to and continue to consult with regularly help me figure out what I am interested, who to talk to, what concepts to learn, and where to apply. I wouldn&#39;t stress this as much were you to, say, do the 5th year MS program, as while there is a strong research component to it,\u00a0applying to and doing a PhD is\u00a0typically a much greater effort. Also, keep in mind you would have to identify a research interest that you can commit to over 4-5&#43; years, invest money into it, use your passion for this particular research question to get people to give lots of grant money to you, appeal to professors who get a lot of demand from grads who want them to be their adviser, etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It seems from your questions about classes that you have some time but also some way to go in terms of identifying this interest: I would say talk to professors (from other schools as well, if there is someone elsewhere who aligns more with your research interests), get them to recommend research, dissertations, etc. scholarly texts that you can read to\u00a0get a sense of the current academic/industry climate in ML and the open questions you are interested in answering. Then go back to those people and discuss this, and they may even become invested in you enough to write letters of rec., and provide other misc. support (which you will need for a PhD). Your application and career as a PhD will likely be dependent on other individuals and specific areas of ML research--try to insert yourself into this space now if possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR: Talk to people, read stuff, talk to people.
