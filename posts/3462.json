In its place, students will instead take four technical units. The reason for this change is that the EE16A/B sequence (which is already required for EECS students) covers 90% of the content included in Math 54 (and in fact expands beyond Math 54 in certain areas, specifically SVD and DFT). Please note that students who have already taken Math 54 or 110 will have satisfied the requirement.</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Technical units may include courses from the following departments: Astronomy, Chemistry, Earth and Planetary Science (other than 170AC), Integrative Biology, Molecular Cell Biology, Physics, Plant &amp; Microbial Biology, Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, and any Engineering department (including EECS).\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>These technical units cannot include: any course taken on a P/NP basis; courses numbered 24, 39, 84; BioE 100; ChemE 185; CS C79, 195, H195; Des Inv courses (except Des Inv 15, 22, 90E, 190E); Engin125, 157AC; IEOR 95, 172, 185, 186, 190 series, 191, 192, 195; ME 191AC, 190K, 191K.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gro4nnkuub\">&#64;Elad Alon</strong> \u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>#pin</div>\n</div>", "created": "2017-02-28T22:25:36Z", "subject": "Changes to Math Requirement for EECS Major", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "izq3qm6ebc93j5", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 3462, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552886871, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"ij26t89ebgo13n": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy5cby5q1ok", "name": "Alex Krentsel", "photo": "1473009784_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/icguy5cby5q1ok/1473009784_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["icguy5cby5q1ok"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "instructor-note", "program_updates"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 2575}
