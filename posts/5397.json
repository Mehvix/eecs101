But it&#39;s the fact that 189 as a class is not meant to teach you the fundamentals of probability and optimization in the same ways that 126 and 127 are, that nudges me towards recommending you take 126/127 beforehand. You shouldn&#39;t sit through lecture trying to learn the math you already should have known, you should be connecting the dots between the already-familiar concept of log-likelihood and its applications in machine learning.</p>", "created": "2017-10-25T09:55:41Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I\u2019m currently in 189, and I have not taken 126, 127, 110, or 16B.
