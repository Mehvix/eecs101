I started learning a bit in high school, so I didn&#39;t find 1A and 1B too hard (though memorizing characters gets more difficult as you go). Regardless of how easy you think it is, it is an immense amount of work. You have homeworks literally every day, a quiz every week, a test every two weeks, with oral exams/reports and discussions sprinkled throughout the semester, not to mention the hour-long class every weekday and a 30-minute tutorial &#34;discussion&#34; once a week. Even if each assignment takes you half an hour (low estimate), you still have to study quite a bit to keep up with the questions and conversations in class, and writing characters takes a while to get ingrained (at least for Chinese, but I think Japanese requires you to memorize characters as well?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is not to say I wouldn&#39;t recommend you taking the course. I find it very fun and I&#39;m only one data point, but beware of how much work it is.\u00a0 It is easy to let other difficult 4-unit techs take a backseat for too long, and while I haven&#39;t personally taken the other two classes, I have heard they are difficult and a lot of work themselves, so you might not get a super high grade. Of course, your mileage may vary. I took Chinese for a grade every semester, so if you PNP, it might not be as difficult, but I would argue you&#39;re really not gonna learn a language well if you PNP. You need to be doing at least as well as the rest of the class to keep up with discussions.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfivqsei4f2", "name": "Nicholas Berberi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvfivqsei4f2"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2020-05-09T10:00:23Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 5/3 - 5/9", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-09T14:43:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9zqnavi1jh3v8", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<md>I've taken Japanese 1A-100B, and I would say the workload is not that bad compared to a CS class. I'm not saying its workload is low. It is still a 5-unit class, so prepare to spend 12-15 hours on it every week: 1 hour of lectures every weekday, about 1 hour on homework almost weekday, some extra time studying for oral presentation / essay / midterm / reviewing / etc. The total amount of studying is not low, but the structure of the course forces you to spread it out. Whereas CS courses just usually demand much more work than 12 hours / week and the workload in every week can be quite uneven...\n\nAs for the language itself, I would say it demands a different set of skills from CS, but it is not too bad. In addition, almost all the teachers in the Japanese program are quite nice (including one being the nicest teacher I've ever met), so you will have a good time learning the language.\n\nNote that for Japanese 1A, you need to memorize about 100 symbols (hiragana and katakana) in the first 2-3 weeks of class. This usually makes a lot of people to drop the class. If you are sure you want to learn Japanese, I would recommend you starting to memorize them over the summer. Also note that I speak Chinese and you will need to memorize Chinese characters (kanji) so my estimate of workload could be on the low end (tho not off by too much for first-semester Japanese imo). </md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnpfrl2qk2e6"], "type": "followup", "uid": "j6l0q8u46ag7a4", "updated": "2020-05-09T14:43:16Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/3 - 5/9", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-09T15:25:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9zs5cwzx9xzh", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Having taken Japanese 10A-100B, I would highly suggest learning some of the language before you even begin in the class just for fun.
