My favourite parts of the course were actually controls and signals, which I didn&#39;t even know were a thing before taking the courses. And even the circuits module is taught in a much different way from what most high school students are used to seeing. The rules of how to solve circuits are laid out in a very clear, logical way, and the professors take every opportunity to tie circuits concept back to linear algebra.

The problem I was working on had something to do with quantum algorithms. I realized that the problem could be solved using the Discrete Fourier Transform, which is one of the big topics in EE 16B. I&#39;m pretty sure that was not the intended way to solve the problem, but my knowledge of 16B material helped me do it anyway! And there are countless other examples of places where EE 16AB material will come in handy, such as the Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis in CS 189 and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm in CS 170, to name a few. Not to mention the fact that 16AB will give you experience working with IPython notebooks, which have been an immensely useful tool for me when doing data-analysis type projects.
