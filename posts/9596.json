Basically, I want to take an extra semester so I can be able to take more CS classes. I&#39;m thinking 7 computer science upper divs minimum. I could graduate on time but my need for the extra semester is based on my belief, whether true or untrue, that exposure to different sub-fields within CS is very important. Before I get to my main reason for posting here, is there an advantage in taking more CS classes than the 5 that are required to walk out with a CS degree? Personally, I seem to think that 5 classes are a little too few and I won&#39;t be making the most of all available offerings in terms of CS classes here at Cal. Hence the reason for taking the extra semester. Cost, for me, is not the issue but rather the thought of graduating with an inadequate set of skills required for the tech industry at the moment. Now, various other people, including faculty have expressed the opinion that the lower division classes are all one needs to work in industry, which while true, beats the purpose of coming to Cal to study EECS in the first place. Will I end up a half-baked graduate if I just take the minimum 5 CS/EE upper-divs required, or is it perfectly okay to just get 5 upper-divs done and call it a day? This will help me decide on whether or not taking the extra semester is necessary. In general, i&#39;ll feel bad if I don&#39;t at least explore the various classes here. As an international student, and like everyone else, I want to get the full value of the education that am paying high dollars for. Are there any perceived advantages in people who graduated having met the bare minimum requirements versus those who took, say, 8 or even 9 upper-div classes? Does anyone else feel like 5 upper-div requirements is maybe too lenient.....?</p>\n<p>Now, onto my main reason for posting:</p>\n<p>I&#39;m considering the Computer Systems track, and I plan on having the following schedule for, well, the three semesters that I intend on being a student here:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>side-note: Am also enrolled in CS61C for this summer, and I feel like I shouldn&#39;t take any other class alongside it.
