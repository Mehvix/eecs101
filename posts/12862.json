I figured out what lab(s) I was interested in working in at the end of the summer before sophomore here. I considered what I wanted to do and what would be interesting. At this point I was just out of 61B with no (and I mean n o) real coding experience and no research experience (I didn't even have an internship that summer). Once I figured out what areas I was interested in, I signed up for the mailing lists that those labs are on. If you are into AI for instance, BAIR has a general mailing list and most sub areas have their own mailing lists too. I started going to as many talks and meetings I could manage. This serves in two ways - firstly, you understand what people are actually doing in that area. What research is actually going on in Berkeley and other institutions? People don't really update their websites that often but people always present on the newest and most exciting part of their research. Go to these meetings and write down what they are saying and look it up later. You don't need to understand how they do what they do - you need to understand what they do and why. The why is important because most grad students talking to each other don't get into the gritty details of their project. The idea is everyone already kinda knows how research is done and how things are built. They talk about the thing that they are doing and why they are doing it. Once you have gone to these talks for a couple weeks, you need bravery. This will probably be harder online but you need to talk to people! This is a bit like dating I guess, if you go into it just trying to find any grad student to take you, you'll probably not find it. Instead, talk before and after these meetings, email grad students who you've seen at these talks. Discuss what they are doing on a high conceptual level and if you find something interesting, express it! Grad students are where they are because they are excited about what they are working on, so if you show that same energy it will be easier to get to know them. Once you find someone who you vibe with and who's research you like, just ask them if you can work with them. Even if they don't have time or whatever, they will be able to direct you to other grad students who have similar interests and give you a leg up in getting their attention. I disagree with a lot people that you need to know everything before you start research. You should be exploring these topics on your own and have a general understanding of the field but the whole point of being an intern is to learn and the people you'll work under will know that. </md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j51gxcqxjxc1zy", "name": "Ganeshkumar Ashokavardhanan", "photo": "1600371218_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j51gxcqxjxc1zy/1600371218_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jwqtfewkosp36u": 1565939539}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "joxuc64phf6zu", "name": "Alexander", "photo": "1583657790_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/joxuc64phf6zu/1583657790_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh19bukde2t2", "name": "Zeyi (Jackson) Yan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jivw8jkn7ig1lu", "name": "Jamie Hong", "photo": "1610660535_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jivw8jkn7ig1lu/1610660535_200.jpg", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k5k3fsp6g1u6lv", "name": "Dayne Tran", "photo": "1595720343_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/k5k3fsp6g1u6lv/1595720343_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1584487673, "jz3nrud5bim5td": 1576367081, "k5iux9o5vvc5c9": 1587836161, "ke845vklu6nlh": 1601676703}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jc8a4c4dl3u6dc", "name": "Bijan Fard", "photo": "1529342919_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jc8a4c4dl3u6dc/1529342919_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kaww3dlpw6n2fg": 1597045529}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpumlqaf2qb", "name": "Esther Cai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kaww3dlpw6n2fg": 1596584152}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k0enjpttx8h1he", "name": "Cathy Han", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdiyimfab4tr", "name": "Nathaniel Lum", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1574134997, "jwslfmrdirb540": 1565228726, "jym2724oqrk2bm": 1568516245}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji3ybsgdzii5h7", "name": "Vivrd Prasanna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j51gxcqxjxc1zy", "joxuc64phf6zu", "jzdh19bukde2t2", "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "jivw8jkn7ig1lu", "k5k3fsp6g1u6lv", "jc8a4c4dl3u6dc", "jzlnpumlqaf2qb", "k0enjpttx8h1he", "jzqdiyimfab4tr", "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "ji3ybsgdzii5h7"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-08-11T18:15:40Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/9 - 8/15", "bucket_order": 39, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-08-12T00:51:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kdqnr3aj7kz4b9", "subject": "<md>Thank you so much for your advice!!!
