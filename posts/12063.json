EECS16A has no prerequisites other than calculus and is designed with freshmen and incoming transfer students in mind. It is designed to be taken alongside 61A. Furthermore, we reserve seats for freshmen and incoming transfer students in the class, so you are essentially guaranteed a spot in the class your first year. It will be harder to get into the class as an upperclassman.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q2: Should I take EECS 16A and EECS 16B before or after CS 70?<br />A2: EECS16A and 16B were specifically designed to help ease the transition to CS70 for incoming students. These classes provide an introduction to proofs and the kind of mathematical thinking that is very useful in a class like CS70. We recommend you take 16AB before taking CS70, this should help you have an easier time in CS 70.</p>", "created": "2020-04-29T03:45:58Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Seems fine to me...
