These differences have been traditionally assessed qualitatively -- for example, some tumors will appear brighter or darker than normal tissue. In recent years, there is a strong trend in making MRI quantitative, i.e. putting numbers, which relate to the physical mechanism of the tissue. This has a potential for better sensitivity, and the ability to perform automatic diagnosis with modern machine learning tools. Unfortunately, quantitative MRI still suffers from many shortcomings. One of the most significant is standardization and calibration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this project we are aiming to create MRI &#34;phantoms&#34; made of calibrated chemicals, with shapes mimicking anatomy. These will enable calibration of quantitative MRI scans across multiple platforms and different sites.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are looking for students with experience, or strong will to learn quickly CAD tools and 3D printing to design, test phantoms for MRI.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Project 2: \u00a0MRI receive coils</p>\n<p>MRI receive coils are near field antennas, which are used to sense the MR signal. We are looking for students with experience or strong will to learn quickly in CAD, 3D printing, and analog Radio frequency circuits to participate in several exciting project in this area.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students will \u00a0also get to learn and operate MRI scanners.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please contact me by email with subject [MRI instrumentation research project] mailed to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:mikilustig&#64;berkeley.edu\">mikilustig&#64;berkeley.edu</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- Miki</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2020-02-18T03:34:46Z", "subject": "Looking for keen undergraduate students for 2 MRI instrumentation research projects", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k6rc3m3rlbc280", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11417, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544470422, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6levlfacj825w", "name": "Matthew Zurek", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6levlfacj825w"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "instructor-note", "research"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 584}
