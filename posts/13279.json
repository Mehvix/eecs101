Even if you do, academic excellence is not the sole focus of a PhD program (and not even the primary focus, frankly), and research and LORs are both crucial. Triple majoring is not going to be a game changer for PhD committees and I advise against pursuing it if that&#39;s the goal you have in mind; instead you should only pursue it if you have an active interest in all three fields and can make time for the course load while still exploring extra curricular avenues.

I&#39;m a junior who is most likely heading towards a PhD and most people who I knew freshman year who were into the idea of a PhD have realized by now that it isn&#39;t for them (not that no one sticks with it). What you should realize is that you should do a PhD if you find an area that you genuinely have a lot of interest and excitement in AND you enjoy doing research. Considering you have taken very little CS so far, you probably don&#39;t know which area you will love, or even if there will be such an area. Think of it this way - if you want to get a PhD in an area, you should be so excited about it that you are willing to take a significant pay cut for anywhere from 5-10 years to\u00a0<em>just focus on that area\u00a0</em>(keep in mind that applying to PhD is done by area of study/professor so Stanford sounds fancy but they may not have a professor interested in what you want to do or they might have a professor but they are not looking for students that year). It&#39;s a big commitment and it&#39;s not worth it for the vast majority of people. I recommend trying to get research as early as next semester, just to dip your toes in (don&#39;t get your mind set on any specific lab already - as a freshman you may have to email a lot of grad students to get something). Anyway, if you still are sure you want to do a PhD I cannot recommend enough dropping to one major, maybe two. I&#39;m a double major, but double majoring in CS and math is brutal and will honestly probably hurt you more than it will help. Keeping a high GPA will be very difficult and both majors will take up a lot of your time which would be better spent doing research. And it&#39;s not that impressive to colleges, they don&#39;t really care about how well you take tests because a PhD program is not college pt.2 it&#39;s basically a job.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_5", "updated": "2020-10-13T19:51:20Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11033": 6, "12752": 9, "1603": 4, "3889": 5, "4185": 3, "4379": 0, "4907": 8, "7246": 1, "8523": 2, "8732": 7}}, "created": "2020-10-10T02:53:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "research", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a freshman considering triple majoring in Applied math, Stats, and CS, and plan to apply for PhD in EECS/Computational Math/Stats at Stanford (ICME) and MIT (EECS).</p>\n<p>Does A&#43; on transcript matter for PhD application?
