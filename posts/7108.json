The combination of hard &#43; not interesting/motivating really fucks with your ability to cope with the stress. This may not apply to you if end up becoming more interested in the subject - for example, my fall schedule is as hard or arguably harder than what I took this past spring but the difference is that I am excited for these classes - I chose them. [also I appreciated the material I learned in 61c much more after I finished the class. It was hard to see the point of it all in the midst of the pure misery, but afterwards I was like &#34;wow I actually know how a computer works now&#34;]</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have not taken ee16b so I cannot comment on it</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In all honesty, if you have the schedule flexibility, take 70 by itself without any other major tech class (except maybe math 54 - I think that would be doable but then again I LOVED 54). That way you can really put in the time the course deserves to understand and empathize with the material.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you don&#39;t have the flexibility (or just want to get the reqs over with like I did [I wholeheartedly regret that decision]) (or anticipate yourself adapting to the material well), then take mine and other classmates advice as you will.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is9ein4lpno52m", "updated": "2018-05-31T03:16:54Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/27 - 6/2", "bucket_order": 141, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-31T17:52:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhuu7bggnqn230", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "I would highly recommend not taking 61C and 70 together.
