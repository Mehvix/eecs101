I think we spent a whole week talking about how git and github works,\u00a0and it talks a lot about file structures and things of that nature. You&#39;ll mostly be learning about how R works as a language and how to apply it to very basic problems (like rolling a dice, using pretty basic packages to plot\u00a0data) as opposed to real data analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#39;s quite easy for people who have CS skill to get a good grade in the course, though.
