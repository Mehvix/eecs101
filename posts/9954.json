This seems like the most relevant class I could take for that. On the other hand, my only experience with linear algebra is ee16a last fall. I did very well in that class though, and how I handled my spring schedule leads me to believe I could probably do well in 127 if I put in the effort, especially if I start self-studying the last few weeks of the summer.\n\nHowever, I want to focus on internship recruiting and interview prep in the fall, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good idea to burden myself with a pretty heavy schedule. I&#39;d replace 127 with either math 110 or stat 135, and I&#39;m pretty confident I could handle 170/61c/{110/135} fairly well (in that it&#39;d be comparable to my spring schedule).\n\nHow hard and time consuming is this class compared to something like cs70?
