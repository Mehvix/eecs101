The DOJ is asking that Berkeley either make the materials compliant with the ADA or pay a fine. Compliance for all past lecture videos would be in the realm of a few hundred thousand dollars.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The thing about the ADA that&#39;s annoying is that it&#39;s mostly implemented and enforced in a zero-sum sort of way. i.e. If X group can&#39;t have access, then no one should. On the other hand, I can&#39;t think of a better way. If the government never requires businesses to produce content or build physical spaces or software or whatever that are accessible to the disabled, then there&#39;s very little incentive for businesses to ever produce such things. Most people, in fact the vast majority, of people do not need wheelchair ramps. They cost an outsized amount to build for the number of users they serve.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this case we&#39;re dealing with closed captions, primarily intended to be used to deaf people.
