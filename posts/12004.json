Would some of the students be on zoom on the instructor&#39;s laptop while the rest of the class is sitting in desks? I guess this could work if the projectors get used to allow the in-person class to see the zoom students, but participating and lag may become an issue, esp. with everyone on the same Airbears network. Or would instructors just have an in-person section and then another virtual section? That seems infeasible bc that&#39;s twice the work for instructors... I can see this working for CS classes since many students don&#39;t really show up to things even in a normal semester, and multiple TAs means you could have some virtual discussions and some in-person ones. But I plan to take language/other classes next semester too, which may just not work out well with the in-person/online combo, so I&#39;m wondering if I should even try to look for housing...</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-04-24T22:58:52Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-24T06:01:13Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9dse6d2i486a7", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Im in a similar situation housing wise, but I expect this is a question instructors have yet to deal with.
