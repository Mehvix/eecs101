Even though it has other components, like taking classes and, sometimes, teaching classes (as a TA or lead instructor), research is intended to be and almost always is the primary focus. You are essentially accountable directly to your advisor(s), in an arguably unhealthy way, so you can generally expect anything you do outside of research, especially once you&#39;ve satisfied your core course and teaching requirements, to be monitored (at best) or intensely scrutinized (at worst). This is even more the case when you don&#39;t have backing from external funding (e.g. fellowships). Hypothetical: Imagine you were an advisor who hired a student (this is literally the phrasing used) using your own hard-earned research funds (typically from grants written by other students) and they spent their time taking random useless classes instead of doing the research you were paying them to do!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Anyway, up until about your third year, you have some leeway to take courses that interest you, as long as they can satisfy degree requirements and are vaguely related to your research. The EECS PhD at Cal used to have an &#34;outside minor&#34; in which you were forced to take at least one grad class in an entirely different discipline, but this has been phased out in favor of an &#34;elective requirement&#34;, in which you take one &gt;100 level class outside of EECS and and one &gt;100 level class from any department (including EECS).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want an idea of what the core curriculum looks like for an EECS PhD, in integrated circuits (&#34;INC&#34;), incoming PhD students are essentially required to take EECS 251&#43;251LA (ASIC lab) and EE 240A in their first semester. Advisors typically caution against taking more than two courses in a semester, in general. In the second semester, these students will then take EE 241B and EE 240B, before doing their oral prelim exam near the beginning of the third semester (it&#39;s kind of like an intense technical interview for the right to stay in the PhD program). Preparation for the prelim is the most important thing up until it is passed, which is why students generally take the classes which have content listed as &#34;fair game&#34; for the prelim. You have two tries, or even three, if they like you -- meaning that you are doing good research. Afterward, research becomes unequivocally the most important thing, although it still was very important to begin with.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;d like an idea of what the experience looks like for another program, I have a friend who chose to enroll in Stanford&#39;s CS PhD program instead of Cal&#39;s. From what I can understand, that program doesn&#39;t seem to have any core course requirements (outside of the number of units required for graduation) and doesn&#39;t have any prelim requirement either. There are actually breadth requirements, but students are given freedom to select courses as they&#39;d like. There&#39;s also a qualifying exam (research presentation &#43; controlled grilling), but Cal has that too. I guess I can understand why my friend chose Stanford.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tl;dr: The PhD in STEM is about research. Qualified &#34;no&#34; to the second question. Third question: generally 2, ideally fewer, if possible, so that you can put more effort towards research.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "name": "Owen Bai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgw2lrsc5g2", "name": "Aditya Ramkumar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "jktvgw2lrsc5g2"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-01-08T19:44:16Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10801": 3, "1083": 1, "11075": 2, "11988": 5, "12931": 8, "7751": 6, "8813": 0, "8932": 7, "9630": 4}}, "created": "2021-01-06T09:27:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "research", "faculty_advising", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>How does PhD in STEM work?
