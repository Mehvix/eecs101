Feel free to take what is useful to you and ignore everything else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, I want to just discuss some of the points you brought up specifically :)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&gt;\u00a0Does anyone ever feel that Berkeley pushes the limits of human productivity?<br /><br />Yes, and I think that&#39;s why a lot of people are here!\u00a0<strong>However</strong>, there is a difference between pushing the limit (we should always aim to push ourselves to grow in whatever ways we desire) and unhealthily trying to do too much. --&gt; You can do anything, but not everything! Find the few things you really <em>want</em> to do, and focus wholeheartedly on those things.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&gt;\u00a0I&#39;m only take 4 classes(EE16B, Stat 134, Math 53, and a breadth; and auditing CS 70)<br /><br />This is... a lot!!!! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve taken 4 full classes in a long time, and I think I&#39;ve only done three techs a semester about twice in my time here (I&#39;m a senior). Plus you&#39;re auditing CS 70! This is hard work!!! Don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re &#34;not doing much&#34; compared to others. Also, while some people are able to take many classes, do research, extracurriculars, etc. I\u00a0don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever\u00a0found someone who can do\u00a0<em>everything.\u00a0</em>We all make sacrifices and have to choose what to spend our time on. Plus, you shouldn&#39;t use other people as goalposts, but simply as inspiration. Pick and choose from the people you admire and try to emulate what you like, but you don&#39;t have to do everything everyone else is doing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&gt;\u00a0\u00a0I really enjoy going to live lectures/discussions because I somehow find a beauty in the concepts taught, but if I can achieve that same understanding on a webcast at 1.5 times the speed, am I actually spending my time wisely?<br /><br />If you enjoy it, I think it&#39;s a wise use of your time. Fist, going to lecture/discussion is objectively a productive use. Perhaps it is more effective to watch a lecture at home, but really this only amounts to minutes of your day. Is the joy worth it? Maybe it feels like work, but going to lecture can be a treat as well. Sometimes when I&#39;m overwhelmed by other stressed in life, I go to lecture just to treat it as time that I can be 100% focused on academic topics rather than worry about other things. Maybe it&#39;s the same for you too.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&gt;\u00a0I&#39;ve been habitually staying up for over 36 hours at least once every week to do work/study for exams while balancing everything else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please sleep :) You know it&#39;s good for you and ultimately increases productivity, and is generally very important for your health and sanity.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some advice on productivity/time management that has worked for me, and maybe you can try it out:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul><li>Keep track of how much time you&#39;re spending on things. How much time on homework? How much time on extracurriculars? Socializing? Work? etc. Do this for about a week, then look at how you&#39;ve been spending your time and see where you would like to re-allocate your hours. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Sometimes you have to spend less time with friends to do work, or\u00a0<em>sometimes you have to skip a couple questions on your homework to make time for friends</em>. The second part may sound silly, but sometimes we have to make a decision between these. In the long run, neither is more wrong or correct than the other! It&#39;s just up to what we want to do; we have to find the things we actually care about.\u00a0</li><li>Schedule your day-to-day routine rigorously. Not just a to-do list, but\u00a0block out the times you will spend doing whatever activities\u00a0on your Google calendar, planner, or whatever. Allocate about 1.5x more time for things than you think it will take. Be realistic about what you can accomplish on any given day.\u00a0</li><li>&#34;Research&#34; your own habits -- what times of day are you most productive? Where are you most productive? Don&#39;t be afraid to try something new every day. If it doesn&#39;t work, give it one more try, then scratch it off your list of &#34;experiments&#34;. Keep on trying until you start converging on what works.</li><li>Don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. I&#39;ve often let a bad day ruin my entire week, thinking things like &#34;There&#39;s no point in trying, since I can&#39;t ever keep up with other people&#34;. We are always surrounded by amazing people here, but everyone is amazing in their own ways. Some people are just able to work seemingly forever. Some of us aren&#39;t; so what?\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#43;1000 the student answer, to find what you love to do or what you really care about and focus on that. Maybe find ways to merge certain passions together! And sometimes (often!!) those things change from semester to semester, if not week to week. I think it&#39;s just about making constant adjustments to get what you want out of life.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck!\u00a0<br /><br />(And don&#39;t forget to sleep!!!)\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd0ebjf50lh"], "type": "followup", "uid": "ijkkcj71l3912c", "updated": "2019-02-28T08:11:12Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/24 - 3/2", "bucket_order": 100, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-02-28T15:05:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jsorg43ppm22dz", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>&#64;8109</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-02-28T15:05:12Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/24 - 3/2", "bucket_order": 100, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-01T04:14:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jspjn8pcqxx60o", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I walk a very thin and dangerous line.

This has been more or less my schedule for the past 4 years, having somewhat questionable time-management skills. Has it been hard? Extremely. How do I do it? One noticeable thing I&#39;ve done is\u00a0that I&#39;ve stopped caring about grades. I sought to really focus on my learning and forget about someone else&#39;s opinion about how much they think I know. I&#39;m happy with my usual\u00a0Bs and Cs; I think it&#39;s good enough personally. I think this really takes off a mental load/more work off my plate and I think the sacrifice is worth it.\u00a0I don&#39;t go to lectures or discussions because I&#39;m a slow learner and\u00a0I often don&#39;t find people who teach technical classes good\u00a0at teaching/giving advice (imo).

My Tuesdays and Thursday schedules have lectures from 8am to 6:30pm while I have 3 discussions and a lecture MWF. My question is, how exactly do people do this on top of research/internships/running decals/exercising/personal leisure or any other extra curricular? At times, I feel like people just don&#39;t go to class, yet professors stress the importance of going to lecture and keeping up with the all material that seems like a 20 hour/week task.
