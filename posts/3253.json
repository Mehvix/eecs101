You need to understand the core idea of something before you can understand other manifestations of the idea as well as extensions. EECS courses aren&#39;t cookbooks with recipes for you to follow. And in the lower-division at least, many things are taught to you in a way that does double or triple duty --- you are not just being taught about X, but also how to think more generally, as well as learning ideas that are more broadly applicable.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For error correcting codes themselves, EE229B talks about them in more detail and brings you closer to the state of the art. This is not to say that the codes taught in 70 aren&#39;t\u00a0useful today --- many modern implementations take the ideas of Reed Solomon codes taught in 70 and make things more efficient by exploiting ideas of extension fields (taught in EE229B and Math 114 I believe). There are also other qualitatively distinct code families, namely the polar codes, LDPC codes, and turbo codes, that are increasingly popular today in cutting-edge applications. To understand LDPC and Turbo code constructions and implementations, you need to understand more about message-passing inference algorithms as well as things like linear programming and optimization. To understand polar codes, you need more information theory (EE229A) as well. These modern families build more directly on the material in *core* EECS courses like 126, 127, etc. rather than on the algebra and algebraic geometry underlying other codes in the Reed Solomon style.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember, a Bachelor&#39;s degree gives you the education you need to be an apprentice that learns on the job, and can keep on learning for the next 4&#43; decades. It cannot make you a master at anything without sacrificing your long-term future for an ephemeral gain in the present. Lower-division is designed to help you build a solid foundation to prepare you for *learning* more advanced material.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-01-24T07:34:22Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "iyb7hnxws1n5xv", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hqh2601nec6eo", "name": "Roman Wright", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "ireb05q4pq01oe": 1, "irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "name": "Nitzan Orr", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iau5w7l6tv98u", "name": "Nathan Pham", "photo": "1480669160_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iau5w7l6tv98u/1480669160_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"inpjqrbfv3n67o": 1, "is95g1whduc4c8": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijkkwqgtu6j3vj", "name": "Gigi Lu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hv91iivr1r15z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "name": "Ross Teixeira", "photo": "1414220212_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hkkhvv2dy9f4kl/1414220212_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icu2xhmuxxk2ub", "name": "Pei Yong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idriks20rqg42v", "hqh2601nec6eo", "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "iau5w7l6tv98u", "ijkkwqgtu6j3vj", "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "icu2xhmuxxk2ub"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-23T06:37:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>After learning most concepts, I feel inadequate because I know in the real world, they&#39;re not using this concept: They&#39;re using something much more sophisticated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, Error Correcting Codes (CS 70): The ECCs we learn were discovered in the 1970s.
