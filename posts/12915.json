Personally I think cs70 is not that great of a course, however the level of rigor is puts you through for critical thinking skills is really important for many courses (like 170, 189, etc), not to mention it teaches you the basics of probability and proofs needed for those CS courses as well. If your really sharp you could maybe pull off 170 and 188 without 70, but I would recommend this for like 98% of people, its just unneeded stress.\u00a0 61c is also really important because it unlocks most course paths that have to do with anything below application level programming (like 162, 152, 151, 168,\u00a0 etc) . I think once you take those courses, you would have a much better idea of what kind of courses you might want to take, and which ones you would like to avoid.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I was looking for courses to take, I would peek at the upcoming schedules (CS:<a href=\"https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html\">https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html</a>) (EE: <a href=\"https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html\">https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html</a>), and see what interested me. Currently taking a look at the CS one, I can see that you could maybe pull off CS160, but that class is notoriously difficult to get into unless you a senior. You might want to try CS169, however I havent really heard good things about that class in previous semesters, but supposedly they are restructuring it from the ground up, so you might wanna do a little more research to see what they&#39;ve changed, and if that type of course suites you. I would snoop around the EECS101 Piazza about certain classes for more information. I also recommend you draft some sort of temporary schedule for yourself, trust me it makes figuring out courses and dealing with unexpected course situations a lot easier. It also lets you plan our what prereqs you need to complete.
