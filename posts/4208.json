Personally, I think the issue here is something more than just the difficulty of those lower div CS classes. Its an issue with over enrollment and just how the declaration system works. As far as I know, we are the only UC with an LSCS program and when people are admitted to the college of letters and science, they are not being judged for their major. This means a prospective history, English, computer science major etc are ranked against each other regardless of intended major and with a large number of students intended CS, with the current system, there is no way to distinguish between them. I&#39;ve heard that the average EECS admitted student ranks higher than an average engineering admitted students and I would think the same applies for LSCS intended compared to other majors in letter and science. And with 61A last year being larger than some whole departments on campus, there is a serious issue in our system and because of the budgeting crisis, we admitting nearly 2000 new freshman next year, many of whom I suspect will also be LSCS intended. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if enrollment in 61A goes past 2000. Once solution would be to dissolve the CS major in letter and science and join in into the college of engineering as another major and admit directly when applying rather than declaring, but I doubt that will happen. The other option is to make the courses harder. This isn&#39;t the greatest option, but given the position that the university is in, its the path of least resistance, given the budgeting crisis and overal campus issues. I think the points that you bring up are definitely some that people should think about when deciding where to go. The reason I say all of this is to try and think about the larger picture and what is going on at a university level. Professor Hug, Denero, Rao and other don&#39;t take joy is watching students get wrecked on midterms and finals, they want their students to learn, but are put in an unfortunate situation because of what&#39;s going on at a university level. And I don&#39;t think this is something that can be changed with funding. We are a university supporting all fields of research and thinking, and having half (exaggeration) the university dedicated to CS or EECS is not the ideal.

For some, that climate alone makes it worth it. Others probably have their own reasons, I know a couple friends of mine were attracted by the idea that Berkeley has a reputation in academic rigor (i.e. being challenged extensively). And I have my own reasons for wanting to study EECS here. Would you and I, and many others have an easier time at a CSU or another UC in terms of workload/stress? Definitely. I have no issues making that statement, not only from my experience, but Sahai has made some very good points about this, and not only regarding UCs, but other schools as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So to the point about &#34;worth it&#34;, I think that depends on one&#39;s expectation.
