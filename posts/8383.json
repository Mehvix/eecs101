In each class there are seats reserved for declared CS majors. As far as I am aware, the adjustment period starting on Jan.7 allows everyone to enroll in these classes, ignoring the reserved seating and allowing the waitlist to &#39;funnel&#39; in. In this case, I would not be able to enroll in each class because I am in the back of the waitlists. However, if my CS major application is processed before then, and I am accepted I should be able to get into each class. Am I interpreting this correctly? I just want to make sure I meet the minimum unit requirement and can take classes I need. Any help\u00a0would be greatly appreciated, thank you!</p>", "created": "2018-12-15T21:25:32Z", "subject": "Reserved Seating vs. Adjustment Period", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jppz0c1gp0q6v6", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8383, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547880318, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["iy2fd7c99x41w5"], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 375}
