Some past semesters have been 162/127, 161/186, 170/126, etc. all of which I've found pretty manageable tbh. \n\nIn terms of difficulty levels, I expect 189 to be the most time consuming/difficult. 188 I'm assuming will be the easiest since my roommate took it a few semesters ago and I remember him barely having to spend time on the projects for it. Not really sure about the difficulty level for 182.
