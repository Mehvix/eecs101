As a former TA, especially in office hours where we can talk to students one-on-one, my goal was always to meet students where they are (whether that&#39;s totally lost in lecture or pushing the limits of my own understanding), and go from there. There isn&#39;t any amount you are expected to know beforehand. It is very helpful if you explain what you think you do understand, and where you might&#39;ve gotten stuck.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Examples of things you can ask:</p>\n<p>- I understood lecture up to this point, but then I got lost when the professor said this. Could you explain that?</p>\n<p>- I was trying to figure out how this thing worked, and this was my thought process, but then something seems to have gone wrong. Help?</p>\n<p>- I&#39;m confused about the solution to this problem on discussion/homework. Where did this particular step come from?</p>\n<p>- I understand the solution to this problem on discussion/homework, but I couldn&#39;t come up with it myself. How should I approach this kind of problem?</p>\n<p>- How is this thing we&#39;re learning now related to that other thing we learned before?</p>\n<p>Of course you can also ask about how to do current homework problems, but honestly that&#39;s the least interesting kind of question that you learn the least from...
