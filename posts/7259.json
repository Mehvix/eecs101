I would recommend moving 127 up earlier in the rotation and 126 a bit later if you can; 126 is going to be pretty difficult as a rising (?) sophomore, and although you won&#39;t necessarily gain anything directly relevant for 126 from 170 or 188, you&#39;ll gain probability and proof-solving maturity. You probably also want to take 61c earlier; if you are doing any practical ML programming then the coding concepts emphasized in 61C (namely the last 1/3 of the course which focuses on efficiency, parallelism, distributed computing) will be very relevant. 170/188/61C -&gt; 126/127 -&gt; 189/168 (168 is only offered in the fall afaik) -&gt; 161/162 is a permutation of your proposed schedule that I think could work better for you.</p>", "created": "2018-07-23T08:45:56Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6pa2e9c481b9"}], "id": "jjy10yr6pbg33n", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1557211355, "j6ipkhtdol54dw": 1, "jcfrsqcwoyyi5": 1523820522, "jiow4wnlt5e4v9": 1536690148, "jpdq1epqrr3231": 1557544831, "k5ccgxwqsc126b": 1582933242, "k5oggml4hjtu9": 1581048462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6srsl4o5no", "name": "Benson Yuan", "photo": "1548892164_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6srsl4o5no/1548892164_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p6srsl4o5no"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/29 - 8/4", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/29 - 8/4", "bucket_order": 90, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-30T06:26:46Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jk7w4xyal6o4x3", "subject": "<p>or sorry, it is the same time slot as 170</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-07-30T06:26:46Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-30T06:26:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jk7w4peec534u9", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>as an update, the student&#39;s answer doesn&#39;t make any sense... if they didn&#39;t know, 188 is not being offered this fall</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-07-30T06:26:35Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-23T03:04:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["research", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>For some background, I&#39;m a declared cs sophomore (done with 61ab70 &#43; 16ab &#43; math53) and planning on doing 4 yr masters on the ML track.

If not, which EECS classes can help supplement that, and if not in EECS, what stats/IEOR classes should I take? Also, if there are any order changes in my schedule that you&#39;d find more appropriate to balance / any other classes and advice please let me know!
