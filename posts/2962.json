For example, I got through most of my classes using Microsoft Word&#39;s built-in equation editor, which basically functions exactly the same way that LaTeX does (including having mostly the same set of commands). I only switched to using LaTeX in my last year, mostly because I was already used to it when writing homework/exam problems for 170 / answering questions on Piazza, and Microsoft Word lags massively when you fill up an entire page with equations.</p>\n<p>Other than submitting homework, I&#39;ve found it useful even when working out computations / as a scratchpad, if the computation becomes too complicated to easily read in Notepad.</p>\n<p>Just don&#39;t handwrite your answers.
