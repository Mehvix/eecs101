This is largely up to the student and how they choose to engage with the support being provided.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The goal of all courses and the curriculum as a whole is to make you stronger. Different people come in with different backgrounds and different skills. The combination of support and challenge provided in the early lower-division is designed to help everyone, regardless of their background, come up to the same common level. Once you&#39;ve reached that level, you should need less support. After all, the goal at the end is to make you relatively autonomous as a professional engineer. This happens in stages. It can be scary, but this fear must be navigated and overcome. Step by step.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having experienced what CSM has provided to you in some courses, you should be thinking how you can do that for yourself with your study group. If the HW being provided is not enough, ask yourself how you could *make* more for yourself. If you don&#39;t know how, ask the TAs and the faculty members in office hours how you could help yourself get more practice. They can help you. You can also try to grow these meta-learning skills by volunteering for CSM or being on the course staff for a lower-division course that you now understand well. Helping others understand for themselves something that you yourself had difficulty understanding can help you help *yourself* understand something that you have difficulty understanding. \u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-07-13T04:32:17Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "jjjhk886wus18o", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i5anwjhkfuvw1", "name": "Vrettos Moulos", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrin4yxhispa", "name": "Lakshya Jain", "photo": "1474747210_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idrin4yxhispa/1474747210_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ij26t89ebgo13n": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1mmd6kyj41x", "name": "Elena Herbold", "photo": "1429504496_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1mmd6kyj41x/1429504496_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["i5anwjhkfuvw1", "idrin4yxhispa", "hzd1mmd6kyj41x"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-07-12T22:04:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;ve taken CSM for cs 61a/b 70 and ee16a, and doing weekly worksheets in a more one on one environment was extremely helpful.
