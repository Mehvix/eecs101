A while ago when I did my course planning I was very set on taking CS 189 in this current semester. However I didnt realize until now that since I created this plan the prerequisites for this class have changed to include EECS 126 and 127. I took Math 110 and I feel confident in my linear algebra, however my only experience with probability was with CS70. I think it would be best for me to take 126 this semester and take 189 in Spring to better prepare. I was planning on taking\u00a0CS 170 in Spring 2019. I know that taking both of these courses at once is not recommended, however there is a rule that allows seniors in their last semester to have a reduced course-load if they need less than 13 units to complete their requirements, so I would be able to take 170 and 189 with no other classes. I would really like to take both classes since they are both applicable to what I would like to study in graduate school. I would really\u00a0appreciate any input from other students who have taken these courses if they think this plan would be manageable.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>", "created": "2018-08-28T02:27:30Z", "subject": "Taking 189 and 170 in the same Semester (with no other classes)", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jld3cy5tlau214", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7552, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548666756, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 803}
