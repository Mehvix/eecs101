I think it&#39;s really amazing, constructive, and perhaps the best choice I made in my time here. I wanted to become part of course staff since my first year here, and I became a TA in junior year. I found it legitimately challenging to get noticed, and it took several years of effort. The unfortunate fact is despite the many qualified and very passionate teachers among Berkeley EECS, the actual number of TA positions is not that large. I remember some semesters I applied had an effective 10% acceptance rate for TAs.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CSM and academic interning are a really great way to learn\u00a0techniques for teaching; I took any opportunity I could to teach. CS 370 is also really good, you don&#39;t need to be a TA to take it. The one-on-one tutoring experience I got from that class was fun and invaluable. I also recommend forming relationships with course staff, TAs, head TAs, and professors so they know who you are. Talk and interact with them, say hi to them. You have reason to do so, you&#39;re investing a lot of effort into their course! If you&#39;re able to do this\u00a0and do a good job,\u00a0then\u00a0after a few semesters on a course staff as an AI/reader you will hopefully be offered a TA position. What happened for me is that it took several years to get off the ground, and then everything happened all at once. However, I never feel &#34;finished&#34;, even now I make mistakes as a TA, handle things incorrectly, and there are still many things to learn and improve on.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p95tfsldfi", "updated": "2019-08-09T00:01:18Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-08T21:06:36Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi, I am a recently declared CS major who is really thankful for all that other students (TA&#39;s, course staff, tutors) have done for me in terms of helping me out and teaching me.
