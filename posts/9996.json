Good luck!\n\n--\n\nEveryone has their own approach to learning the material in 70. I disagree with the first poster; in my experience, the notes were all I needed to learn the material. You&#39;re absolutely correct that the notes are difficult to internalize, but be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to them. Reading math takes a lot more time than reading a story, and you shouldn&#39;t be surprised if it takes you multiple hours to learn the notes. Go over them slowly, convince yourself that each step in the proofs/explanations is correct, and don&#39;t move on until you have everything down thoroughly. Imo you&#39;ll get a lot out of the notes.\n\nAs for the midterms/finals, the best strategy is probably just to do practice exams. I noticed especially with the T/F and short answers very similar questions tend to be repeated across years, and you&#39;ll get a lot faster at stuff just by practicing.", "created": "2019-08-10T17:57:03Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>You&#39;re right, the notes don&#39;t do a good job by themselves teaching the content.
