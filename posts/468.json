The Fall offering was super impacted and we were sadly unable to let more than a handful of intended-CS freshmen into the course --- or for that matter, even declared CS students. The Spring offering is both bigger and we expect that most of the pent-up EECS demand will already have been satisfied in Fall. So, quite a few\u00a0seats should be available for L&amp;S students.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, our initial estimates say that 16A in the Spring might still be oversubscribed and because of lab-space limits, the size can&#39;t grow significantly beyond what is on the schedule.
