You may have gotten an A, and simply received a &#34;P,&#34; which may as well have been a C, or you received a C but reported a &#34;P&#34;, and they can&#39;t tell whether that meant you did well or not. The one conclusion they can draw in any case is that you didn&#39;t feel confident, and took the easier route. Plus, the average for a lot of these classes is around a B, and that means most people would receive a &#34;P&#34; anyway, so it doesn&#39;t differentiate you from the competition in any way. But they will probably not\u00a0take the benefit of the doubt,\u00a0so they will assume your &#34;P&#34; means you were on the lower end of the spectrum, unless you can defend yourself right away, which isn&#39;t likely since you&#39;d probably send in your transcript before speaking to anyone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think they would rather see you put in effort,\u00a0but got a B- or perhaps worse in a single class which slightly damaged your overall GPA, than see that you received a &#34;P&#34; in a class and took the easy route (as far as they are concerned). And a &#34;NP&#34; would really turn them off, but it may still be better than getting the letter grade equivalent. Someone who has experience applying to grad programs can confirm, but this is at least what some advisors would tell you.</p>", "created": "2019-10-05T19:07:20Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k1dxj1odk5i419", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/29 - 10/5", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-05T23:14:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k1e6cl50ko3ju", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What about non techs?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-10-05T23:14:15Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-08T00:14:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Bear in mind that graduate school applications are read by human beings, often only one human being.</p>\n<p>That human is subject to all of the random variations that come with having a stochastic biological processor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I were to see a P/NP on a transcript it wouldn&#39;t bother me at all.\u00a0 Others might reject you just based on that one factor.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s not deterministic.</p>", "created": "2019-10-08T00:14:23Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxkz7s1dqu77nq"}], "id": "k1h3dm39zr64k2", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jd6a0pbr7r16ad", "name": "Andrew Shi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jq44ivlnyun5jd": 1557997940}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isj3p2myEtU", "name": "Dre Mahaarachchi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "name": "Jason Xie", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvh2vkpf85nj", "name": "Sang A Park", "photo": "1550445945_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvh2vkpf85nj/1550445945_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jd6a0pbr7r16ad", "iscem14kbsu5vi", "isj3p2myEtU", "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "jktvh2vkpf85nj"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-05T00:37:09Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>As title.
