The goal isn&#39;t to survive the upper-division, it is to thrive there and learn a lot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are plenty of technical courses that can/should be taken while you finish the six lower-div prereqs. For example, lower-division courses in Physics or other sciences. If you have spare cycles, you can also give back by joining course staff or CS Mentors and support 16A, 61A, and 61B. All that will make you stronger.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In rare cases when a student already has the maturity, then depending on the kind of maturity, the question you are asking resolves to the knowledge being assumed. This seems to be where your question is coming from. Now, if you already have a lot of mathematical maturity, then you can just try to take 16B and 70 concurrently. So in that case, the question you are asking has an obvious answer: take 70. The fact that you are still asking suggests that you consider yourself extra mature/strong in some dimension other than the mathematical maturity one. This is tricky.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, this leaves three major maturity dimensions related to this department: software design maturity,\u00a0 hardware design/analysis maturity, and physics maturity. Taking any non-mathy software-oriented course without 61C under your belt is probably not a great idea. But if you&#39;ve got a lot of prior background (and you find 61B a breeze), then that could be possible. On the hardware side, if you have the background, then it might be possible to take 105 in parallel with 16B. This is especially true since the lecture/discussion content on circuits is largely limited to the first few\u00a0weeks of 16B. (Lab skills keep getting exercised throughout however, so this assumes you are strong in lab from other experiences in your background...) If you already have strong physics/chemistry (and at least a vague understanding of probability), then 130 also might be possible. 130 will lean less on the material in 16B than 105 will. Especially if you are willing to self-study a bit ahead regarding the first couple of weeks of 16B.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope this answer helps, but the right answer probably remains to not take upper-division courses until your lower-division is completed.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-11-21T00:51:41Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "ja8wn7vtl486lm", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j52tuayf2uf7om", "name": "Dev Ojha", "photo": "1504021332_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j52tuayf2uf7om/1504021332_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j52tuayf2uf7om"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-11-21T00:59:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>You can try taking CS 186 next semester.
