There&#39;s currently a lot of reserved seats for new freshman and new transfers in the Fall, though I don&#39;t think people can even take 16B their first term if they haven&#39;t taken 16A. If you look at past enrollment for the fall semesters, basically nobody enrolls during the times that new students get to phase 1. So my guess is these will open up to juniors and seniors eventually, and that the class will also expand later since the class normally has more than 300 students (the current capacity) and because the waitlist is really big too</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-04-21T17:23:28Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10889": 3, "11784": 0, "179": 4, "186": 6, "2256": 1, "2331": 8, "5172": 2, "546": 7, "6530": 5, "7454": 9}}, "created": "2020-04-21T09:36:05Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "enrollments", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I was planning on taking 16B in Spring 2021, as a second-semester EECS senior.
