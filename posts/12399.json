I definitely found it to be very doable, since 16A is more structured in terms of having weekly problem sets while 61B is project-based with a more variable workload. I personally spent much more time on 61B particularly because of the difficulty of the projects, but 16A tends to be more conceptually-involved in terms of the actual content if you don&#39;t have any prior linear algebra or circuit-related experience. Other than that though, I found the balance between the two classes to be pretty nice and would definitely recommend it!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kae5mj1snlw61y", "name": "Sharvil Trifale", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jwslfmrdirb540": 1563401585, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1576411252, "k509eg2kx302ol": 1588914914}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "name": "Parth Gupta", "photo": "1567400054_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwu0ujo2fbl4tc/1567400054_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kae5mj1snlw61y", "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-06-03T17:44:09Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11910": 0, "12063": 2, "4219": 5, "5769": 7, "5770": 6, "6902": 4, "6958": 1, "9600": 3, "9822": 8}}, "created": "2020-06-03T17:33:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Can anyone advise on the difficulty and coursework for taking both 16B and EE16A for the 2020 fall semester (after taking 61A this summer)?</p>", "created": "2020-06-03T17:33:35Z", "subject": "coursework and difficulty for taking both 16A and 61B for fall semester?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kazmqmk7a2c7e1", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12399, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654543372683, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 224}
