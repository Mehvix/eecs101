Sorry for the long post! I need some advice/tips for breaking into software engineering. I&#39;m currently heading into my senior year and really have had only one internship experience in an EE related industry I don&#39;t intend on getting into in the future. I accepted that role with the idea that I just needed to get &#34;something&#34; that summer, which was probably the wrong mindset. As far as this current summer, COVID has somewhat limited my opportunities, only managing to secure a couple of interviews but not getting any further than that. So, I&#39;ve been taking summer courses in the meantime. However, I would really like to increase my competitiveness as a student/applicant for the upcoming recruiting season (and throughout the year) so I have a chance at snagging a software engineering related opportunity upon graduation, or maybe even the spring semester, if that&#39;s realistic. For some background, I did not have programming experience before attending Berkeley and I don&#39;t have any personal project experience due to having to devote a lot of my time to my coursework, and other personal issues. I&#39;ve taken courses such as CS170, CS186, and planning to take CS169, CS162, and CS168 (among other EECS courses like 126 and 151) in my final semesters. However, this summer, I&#39;ve been trying to increase my skillset by learning web and iOS development. So, I guess my question is, what would be pertinent tasks to prepare for the upcoming rounds of recruiting? Reviewing 61B and 170 material? Practicing coding challenges on LeetCode and HackerRank? Working on a personal project? (Insert advice here)? \n\nThank you and, again, apologies for the rambling post!", "created": "2020-07-25T23:17:23Z", "subject": "Advice for Upcoming Senior", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kd29x1q8sgq5mk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12762, "num_favorites": 8, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542967419, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzsvx3bhj3rkl", "name": "Wenjie Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh19bukde2t2", "name": "Zeyi (Jackson) Yan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0uuvtahc53y", "name": "Eknoor Kaur", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9s6omub10j", "name": "Jeanelle Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrza1aae94l7", "name": "Ju Sheen Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdjl24y7f5nf", "name": "Amritansh Saraf", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3zadxpy7594", "name": "Viraj Attre", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyf20y5pyas38e", "name": "Keeyou Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzsvx3bhj3rkl", "jzdh19bukde2t2", "jwu0uuvtahc53y", "is6p9s6omub10j", "j3nrza1aae94l7", "jzqdjl24y7f5nf", "j3l3zadxpy7594", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jyf20y5pyas38e"], "tags": ["eecs", "other", "student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 440}
