My impression is that almost everyone supports sourcing candidate from as many avenues as possible (this includes \u201cless prestigious\u201d colleges, HBCUs, bootcamps, etc) as long as the hiring standard isn\u2019t lowered for anyone. Companies outwardly promote this view of their hiring practices. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m only going to comment only on this view, not the view that some candidates should get preferential treatment based on lived or historical discrimination.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two mechanisms that I know of which seem to lower standards for certain applicants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. Application purges</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April of 2017, Google\u2019s Technology Staf\ufb01ng Management team was instructed by Alogna to immediately cancel all Level 3 (0-5 years experience) software engineering interviews with every single applicant who was not either female, Black, or Hispanic and to purge entirely any applications by non-diverse employees from the hiring pipeline. Plaintiff refused to comply with this request.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/ex-google-recruiter-i-was-fired-because-i-resisted-illegal-diversity-efforts/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given that the plaintiffs refusal to comply with the request in this article aggravated all his coworkers, we can only conclude that this isn\u2019t an isolated incidence. I\u2019ve heard of another such purge of non POC applicants from one other anecdotal source (not for entry-level positions). I have no idea how widespread this is, just pointing it out. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2. Grace hopper style interviews</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is more obvious. Basically *some* companies give easier interviews at conferences meant for underrepresented applicants. The company I\u2019m thinking of has a much shorter interview and applicants bypass the onsites which are pretty long and rigorous.

The SAT is a classist test. MCAT and med-school is designed to disfavor the poor (who has money to live for\u00a03 months studying for an exam full time? Not the poor).

And sometimes that bring innovative solutions to problems. But there is no discussion of how enforcing racial and gender quota on admission helps to create that environment. In fact, qualified engineers, each with sufficient skills and profound knowledge of the materials, can build innovative products despite them having the same race and gender. Examples can be found in the rising Chinese technology giants.\u00a0Almost all of the engineers working in companies like Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance or Baidu are of Chinese origin. (They are all Asians.) Compared to politically correct U.S. companies, they don&#39;t have a diversified environment. However, they are spreading new 5G technologies, building fantastic games, maintaining billion-user apps and creating many innovative products. Two Asian males, who are both qualified for the work, are in no way less innovative than an Asian working with a Black. Each individual, even from the same race and gender, grows up differently, thinks differently, and has different approaches to problems. ENFORCING gender and racial diversity in a company doesn&#39;t necessarily bring innovation to the company. What it does is to create a good image of the company, making their costumers feel good about\u00a0its products. I mean, no\u00a0company wants to be politically incorrect in public. That is just commercial suicide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0With that being said, what truly helps\u00a0an industry the most, is to hire people based on only their academic and industrial achievements, giving interviews to people who impress them with their abilities, not their race and gender. That is what I think the OP supports, the traditional merit-based system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0To clarify, I am never arguing against women or POC other than Asians entering tech industry. I am arguing that they should be held the same standard as Asian and White males. What really hurts innovation and progress, it to recruit underrepresented people who don&#39;t possess the same skills as their peers. In fact, it is perfectly normal for a female engineer to be as qualified, if not even more so, than a male engineer. I have seen countless examples of friends of mine, who are amazing female engineers. I also have TAs who are POC other than Asian, that I believe are clearly qualified for any technology industry. No one should ever question their qualification to get the jobs they deserve. However, many &#34;underrepresented&#34; people, clearly without such skillsets, also get way more interview opportunities than white/asian males who work much harder than they do. The reason for this is because currently, tech companies can&#39;t find enough qualified &#34;underrepresented&#34; individuals to boost their image. They have to do some &#34;diversity hire&#34; to reach their quota. I hope that with improved educational system, one day the companies don&#39;t have to enforce a quota to hire enough &#34;unprivileged&#34;. But before that day comes, hiring &#34;underrepresented&#34; individuals who are not as competent as their peers is REVERSE DISCRIMINATION.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 You can argue that\u00a0these individuals are unprivileged in\u00a0terms of race and gender. That even though they are not as competent, they deserve to be rewarded for the injustice done to them. But the way to do it is not to HURT the Asian males, who have never in history contributed to any of the unjust policies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0And when it comes to universities, by saying that affirmative action is illegal so we don&#39;t consider race in admission is really hypocritical to me. (I am definitely not responding to one of the posts above. In my opinion, Cal has done an amazing job of accepting people based on merit, not race and gender.) To support this claim, the university in question should release the data of the following: SAT scores/GPA of all the admitted students from different races, and observe whether there is a clear difference between different races. In Havard, Asian students have to earn more than 300 points on SAT to get the same chance of admission as Black students. You can argue that Asians are simply not charismatic as students from other races, that they have inferior personalities. But please give me a valid reason for this statement, because this is something I find hard to accept. When I mentioned &#34;we barely talk about diversity in terms of class or financial abilities&#34;, I am not saying that it doesn&#39;t matter. On the contrary, I am saying that it deserves more attention! We heard about affirmative action protects people from underrepresented groups\u00a0in terms of race and gender. What about financial status? Have the private universities supported enough poor families? Do they ever give a quota s.t. only 50% of the admitted students should come from top rich families? Interestingly, they talk every day about their diversity, how they accept people from all races. But they never talk about how many poor people they accept, how they give the poor students a chance to get better education. (Cal does great in this regard. Go bears! But the universities I have in mind are really hypocritical in this regard, in my opinion)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Now I will talk about diversity in a broader sense. What I am arguing is, if we want diversity, then we should talk about diversity in all professions. We say that there are not enough women CEOs and engineers, which I totally agree. Women really do have a hard time break the glass ceiling. But we should also talk about firefighters and police officers. These are the professions that endanger the life of employees. We are perfectly happy to let the working environment in these professions be male-dominant. And we don&#39;t think that&#39;s an issue. Because men are more physically equipped than women to handle danger? I don&#39;t think so. I think there should also be diversity programs in these professions. About NBA, I will never deny how hard the black players work, how much social pressure they face. But we never talk about diversity in NBA. Why is that? So it is OK to not have enough Asians in NBA, but it&#39;s totally against the rules of diversity to have not enough black people in technology industries. Yet the media coverage focus heavily on the latter, and barely on the former.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0In my mind, I sincerely hope for a world in which we are never judged on what we are born with, where we come from, what race and gender we have, but only our merits and virtues. However, a limited scope of diversity is a reverse discrimination against certain groups. And diversity should never becomes the reason we give up on more qualified individuals.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_15", "updated": "2019-03-21T03:55:43Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-13T07:39:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jt6w8y6zqrt6fi", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>First, I don&#39;t believe that companies will lower their hiring bar to meet some quota for certain races/genders.

Anecdotally, I haven&#39;t seen any reverse discrimination in tech.

Just look at the gender disparity within EECS (<a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/16/forget-techs-bad-bros-stanford-berkeley-boost-female-computing-grads/\" target=\"_blank\">22% female in 2017 compared to 11% in 2010</a>).

As a CS/EECS grad coming out of Berkeley you should have more than enough opportunities presented to you so that you don&#39;t have to ask or whine about reverse discrimination.

And you have every right to be pissed off about this post, for all the reasons you described.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But I also empathize with OP&#39;s frustration. Felt this a lot when applying to colleges too. No matter our background, we&#39;re taught that hard work pays off - and even if people like me and OP have been given incredible privileges in life, we&#39;ve still had to work incredibly hard to get to where we are now. We&#39;ve made incredible sacrifices just to get to Berkeley - social life, sleep, and unfortunately, sometimes mental health. Often, it feels like that hard work is not paying off. Our burdens are very different in nature, but it&#39;s hard to quantify whose struggles are worse - it&#39;s a value judgment, and lots of other factors, like family dynamics or support networks, can ease or intensify our stress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of the women/POC I&#39;ve worked with are incredibly talented, often the best you can find in the room. However, tech still attracts mostly white/Asian men because of lots of societal factors that we&#39;re well aware of.\u00a0The dilemma arises when\u00a0there&#39;s a cap on how many people are allowed into a certain space, and there&#39;s many more qualified people than there are spots. In these cases, companies/colleges/etc will choose to diversify that space instead of making it 100% reflective of the applicant pool. This is fine to me, and is better than the alternative - I 100% agree that diversity of perspective is beneficial and necessary, so that the things we make benefit everyone. That said, I hope you can see how for white and Asian men, this can be a frustrating position to be in - we&#39;re denied opportunities to use our skills to contribute to society solely because there are too many people like us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m much more educated about these issues, and in a much better place, than senior year of high school when I was rejected by every college I applied to that used affirmative action and accepted by every college that didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been fairly successful in achieving my goals and am satisfied with my life. And OP could certainly seem to benefit from new perspectives. But no matter how well you understand what&#39;s going on, this can still be a frustrating position to be in. Just as OP should think about other perspectives, I ask that you keep\u00a0OP&#39;s perspective in mind as well. Phrases like &#34;Are these the people we&#39;re training?&#34;, to me, reflect a fundamental disdain and lack of empathy for people like OP. Maybe OP doesn&#39;t know about the struggles of others; that&#39;s not entirely on him. But now, he knows better.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I disagree with OP&#39;s ideas and agree with yours. And I don&#39;t claim to understand your struggles as an underrepresented POC, since I was never in that position.

Within the past couple of years there have been some serious screw-ups in the tech world (Google misclassifying blacks, &#34;The Gaydar&#34;, etc.). If we&#39;re not training people to be empathetic (which btw, is a VERY hard skill to have), you&#39;re more likely to hurt people and be less conscious\u00a0of it. Other departments have required science and tech ethics classes. Why aren&#39;t we moving forward into this?\u00a0The rest of the world is not this bubble of privilege. I just wish this school did a better job of teaching that in the sciences (than having to rely on students to voice their opinions and educate others).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m not trying to play the who-worked-harder-game. But on my side of the spectrum, I&#39;ve been denied positions because I didn&#39;t have the qualifications that people with greater opportunity could afford (for jobs and schools). Applying to the Ivy Leagues, I remember one interviewer asked me to give an example of something I did that benefited a community or group. When I told him I was in charge of successfully hiring my college counselor at my school, he told me that wasn&#39;t good enough. Then preceded to tell me an example about another interviewee he had that was going to the olympics for figure skating and all the charity work and inspiration she had done to her fanbase...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the most I can sympathize for the OP. I didn&#39;t choose to grow up POC, and neither did those with privileged backgrounds. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like being Asian nor having money/opportunities growing up. But I do know what it&#39;s like being denied because of something you&#39;re born with, which is something the OP and you expressing. We all had to work hard given the tools we were born with to get here. But you have to understand that if you grew up privileged, you have more of a chance of making it/success than POCs did. When you experience something outside your privilege comfort zone, you get frustrated? You think it&#39;s unfair? I&#39;ve had to deal with being uncomfortable all my life. That&#39;s a slap to my face. This is what gets me angry. As a privileged individual, you have a lot of power. Use it to expand your mind, not close it, not to blame others.

This is bad, and I agree with you that this is not okay. However choosing to hire for a variety of perspectives isn&#39;t a bad thing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The point of diversity is about getting different types of people in a room who think a certain, yet different way. Ask recruiters why they care\u00a0about diversity, (I have, and the good ones usually say this:) you don&#39;t want a room of 1 certain type of thought and of one certain type of person, do you? If you can bring a different type of positive mindset into the room, thinking outside the box, you&#39;re already standing out. You can bring an opinion to the table that can benefit the company that no one else has.

Were there coding opportunities in your middle/high schools? Were you ever hired a tutor? How much did your parents care about your education/success? Did the rest of your neighborhood go to college? This is stuff people take for granted that make a difference in how you succeed. You complaining about 1 advantage that POC people have does not sum up to the scale the privileged\u00a0over-represented have. Do you know how insulting that is to me?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And do POCs really get better offers? Do some more research than just the sources you&#39;ve put up. Don&#39;t bias it up. There&#39;s mountains of studies, statistics, and research about this stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My 2 cents: Take an ethics class. Learn about how privileged you are in life.
