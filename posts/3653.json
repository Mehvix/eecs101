The goals and nature of the course is very different than 16AB. 16AB are first and foremost *freshman* courses intended to provide a grounding in how to think systematically about systems, including both mathematical modeling and connecting to/from the physical world. *Information* and in particular, linear-algebraic perspectives on\u00a0its nature, are at the core of the subject matter in 16AB, and 16AB are intended to form a foundation upon which a great deal more can be built --- courses like 189, 70, 105, 120, 127, 106AB, etc.... \u00a0While in a parallel universe, ME students could conceivably also take 16AB early in their careers (as freshmen and/or sophomores) and the ME curriculum could adapt to rely on the material and perspectives taught there (e.g. feedback control is also a core concern in ME so the material in 16B is conceptually very relevant), just taking 16A as a junior is really not a great idea for serving the needs of an ME student who needs to work with mechatronic systems. \u00a0A service course that is aimed at being the first-and-last course that someone might take in an area is very different than a foundational course. \u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-04-01T00:11:02Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>The EE100 (note the number might change) being developed for ME is very different from what the old EE100 was\u00a0- the class is essentially brand new.\u00a0 The name of the course will be &#34;Electronics for the Internet of Things&#34;; a draft description is below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:&#34;Times New Roman&#34;;font-size:medium;color:#000000\">Electronics has become a powerful and ubiquitous technology supporting solutions to a wide range of applications in fields ranging from science, engineering, healthcare, environmental monitoring, transportation, to entertainment.
