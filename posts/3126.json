Additionally I have heard rumors that 61c is switching the curriculum to be based off of ARM\u00a0instead of MIPS\u00a0which will mean that all the projects will be new or ported to a new platform\u00a0and your TA&#39;s will also be as new to ARM as your are (unless they had other prior experience that most EECS/CS students don&#39;t get). I wouldn&#39;t advise taking 170 before 70 since 70 teaches you how to do proofs and you learn a lot of useful things in 70 that come into play in 170. I personally wouldn&#39;t take 61c and 70 together because of their workloads. I found 61c to be the most workload intensive class I have taken at Berkeley by a significant margin. I have heard pretty positive things about 162 but I can&#39;t speak to it personally. I would advise\u00a0waiting on taking 61c because of the switch to ARM and being cautious about the workload of your other classes the semester you take it.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2017-01-12T08:42:03Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/8 - 1/14", "bucket_order": 169, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-12T08:47:41Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixu4tq5mw9b7jr", "subject": "<p>I actually already took 61c and 70 together last semester :) I am tentatively planning on taking 162&#43;170, so i wanted to know how the workloads compare against each other, so I could see how much time I should expect to spend on work this semester.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-01-12T08:47:41Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/8 - 1/14", "bucket_order": 169, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-14T01:50:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixwksgg3hfc7fs", "subject": "<p>I&#39;ve taken 61c&#43;70 together as well as 162&#43;170 together.

I ended up sacrificing a lot of time from 170 for 162 (in hindsight, I probably shouldn&#39;t have taken them together), but the workload of 162 is dependent on how good your group is. They have also reduced the amount of work required from when I took it (one less homework and less code you have to write in projects), so it shouldn&#39;t be too bad. As Anon posted above, 170&#39;s workload stems from its problem sets and is more conceptual than 70, so look at the problems when they&#39;re released and think of solutions in the back of your mind.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hkn0lwn020s17v", "updated": "2017-01-14T01:50:08Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-12T03:41:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixttvnz1qy53zh", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>&#43;1, also interested in knowing this.
