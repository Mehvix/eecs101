For example, Google recommends you don&#39;t submit a cover letter when applying to their positions.\u00a0<br /><br />________<br /><br />Cover letters are meant to allow you to speak directly\u00a0to why you are a good fit for a specific position. They are different than your resume in the sense that they let you address\u00a0specifically\u00a0how your skills and experience pertain to the\u00a0position itself. Look up cover letter examples to get an idea of how they tend to be written. Cover letters generally are only relevant when you want to apply to specialized positions. The reason I bring this up is that you are probably applying to new grad software engineering positions (I&#39;m just assuming based on how this is EECS 101 piazza) which tend to not be very specialized positions. If this is the case it is likely unnecessary to write a cover letter. I would say however if you were applying to what you consider to be a specialized\u00a0position then\u00a0you should\u00a0write a cover letter. In the future you will likely specialize more and for future jobs it is likely a cover letter will be important. If they ask why you want to work at the company and it seems like they only want a few sentences I would write something. That won&#39;t take too long and companies do really like to see that you are specifically interested in them.
