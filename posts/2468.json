Below is the enrollment of both classes from this semester. You can see that 188 had a higher enrollment but eventually leveled out during the adjustment period. Reasons could be that since Hug was teaching 188 this semester, popularity peaked for that class. Also, Papad was teaching 170 this semester so that could also account for high interest in 170 this semester. Since neither of those professors are teaching next semester, it is hard to predict which class will be more popular. On a personal experience level, I was able to enroll in CS170 during the adjustment period but experiences may vary from person to person.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyq0br1u3kx7dg/i54jwbkyl3j2nc/iupxe87uf7or/Screen_Shot_20161025_at_1.09.19_PM.png\" /></p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "created": "2016-10-25T20:12:08Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i54jwbkyl3j2nc"}], "id": "iupxhn71sjk5m0", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"iiklg7j9ggf2vl": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idgojxedj4j411", "name": "Andrew Campbell", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idgojxedj4j411"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-25T19:57:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Next semester I am planning to take CS 170, CS 188, and Physics 7B as my techs; historically, which 2 of the 3 should I phase 1?</p>\n<p>Looking through the Piazza, there have been mixed opinions regarding whether to phase 1 170 or 188.</p>\n<p>I would like to phase 1 7b, so if I had to choose one of 170 or 188 to phase 1, which should it be, or should I phase 1 both 170 and 188?
