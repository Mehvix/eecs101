I would describe this combination (AI + private tutor) as a bad idea that isn't forbidden. Academic Intern positions aren't paid course staff positions and primarily exist for the interns to learn about teaching. Therefore, it's not the department's place to put restrictions on your external employment or time. That said, the goal of an internships is to integrate you into the course staff and give you that experience. As a result, I'd recommend that you avoid anything that would be viewed as a conflict of interest if one were in an official course staff position (reader, tutor, or GSI). If that's not clear enough, please use your judgment: would students in the course view a private tutor relationship with an AI as an unfair advantage? I think they could, so that's why I'd recommend against it.</md>", "created": "2021-08-02T18:44:46Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ixkvrxp4cro10j"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>You should ask John DeNero about the ethics of doing this.
