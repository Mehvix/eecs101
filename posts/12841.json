So I think this may be a good sign that they\u2019re gonna take off. However they still call themselves a startup. So if I graduate early I can probably get a return offer here with 110k, which is not high, and I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s sign on bonus or stock or any other compensation. But they say they\u2019re gonna go public in two years, and the growing speed of this company looks quite good. I can also wait a year to graduate and try for FLAG, but that will cost me one year of OOS tuition. I know startups may boast a bit, so idk whether their plans will come true, but they\u2019re visibly growing quite quickly for sure. Just wondering whether it is good to just join this company? (Part of the reason is that I\u2019m lazy and don\u2019t wanna grind through leetcode lol)</p>", "created": "2020-08-07T06:46:26Z", "subject": "Graduate early for growing startup or shoot for FLAG?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kdjv8r1gqyv6sr", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12841, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542879547, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1596323170_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1596323170_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jlju5sx7fao6dp", "name": "Yiyang Yuan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhcjpozd5xg", "jlju5sx7fao6dp"], "tags": ["enrichment_opportunities", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 498}
