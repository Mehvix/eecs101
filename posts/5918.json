You&#39;re totally right that ugrad research roles vary significantly. The more your role requires\u00a0creative thinking and understanding of the material you are working on, the better. Broadly speaking, research requires you to come up with new ideas and test them rigorously. Ideally, you would like to be able to point to specific\u00a0experiences where you can say that you contributed to generating ideas and testing them. So for example let&#39;s say you are working in an electronics lab and the group is trying to test a new idea. Let&#39;s compare two possible roles. One where\u00a0you are soldering\u00a0circuits for a test from a design that\u00a0someone else made verses a role where you are given the open ended problem of designing a test for this theory and you design and solder the circuit yourself; the later role would be better. This is because the later role required you to demonstrated greater understanding of the material and the ability to come up with original ideas where the former demonstrates that you have lab skills and that you were exposed to research. The later is closer to a research role where the former is closer to a lab tech role. Both are\u00a0good\u00a0but the later is better if you are looking for research experience. \u00a0\u00a0<br /><br />Of course you are an undergrad and you will be doing at least some level of (and more likely at first a lot of) &#34;undergrad work&#34; which generally is work that other people would prefer not to do. That is ok and to be expected (you are after all an undergrad). A typical trajectory for a ugrad student is to begin with work that is less interesting and then as you prove yourself your group will give you more interesting work. As you progress you should be open with your professor if you feel that you aren&#39;t learning from your assignments. Most professors who take on ugrads to begin with care about their ugrad students and will do their best to get you work that you find valuable, of course there are limitations which they need to work within. I would suggest that when you initially start doing research in a new lab you don&#39;t do it for course credit or pay. That way if you feel that the lab you are working in turns out to not a good fit, it is easier for you to leave. If you know you love a lab, by all means work in it for pay or\u00a0course credit (disclaimer most labs won&#39;t pay you but course credit is generally easy to arrange). You should always be up front with the professors you are working with and prompt to let them know if you are planning to leave the lab. You should always have complete and polite closure with them if you decide to leave. They won&#39;t hold it against you. The worst thing you can do is sort of &#34;fizzle away&#34; without communicating with them. That gives ugrads a bad rep. I hope that better answers your questions about role, let me know if you have other questions.<br /><br />As the other anon said it is important to be passionate about what you are working on but I think it&#39;s important to keep in mind that sometimes it is difficult to find a group\u00a0that exactly matches what you are looking for. At Berkeley you should be able to find something that is close enough to what you want that you will be happy and will gain valuable experience, even if it isn&#39;t quite what you see yourself doing long term. You should also make sure that the fit with your group is good. You will get more out of your research if you have a supportive group that is a little further from your research interest than you would in a less supportive group that does work exactly aligned with your research interests. \u00a0<br /><br />Publications are a bit of a tricky subject. Unfortunately bc publications are valuable there is a lot of bad science that people try to push through publication.\u00a0If you are trying to go to grad school it helps your chances significantly to publish, so if you want to go to grad school you should make publishing\u00a0a focus. It is difficult to get a publication however, and the quality of what you publish matters so I wouldn&#39;t focus on &#34;churning out&#34; publications but I would certainly make sure that what you are working on has a realistic potential of being published. Often times publishing is &#34;long-run material&#34; so I don&#39;t know what specifically you are referring to with regards to that. For many undergrads getting a publication is their long-run goal. If you get a publication, you will have an advantage over\u00a0many undergrads when applying to grad programs. But again just like the anon above said, you should make sure you are trying to get into grad school for the right reasons. Generally speaking in EE/CS\u00a0going to a phd program\u00a0hurts your finances long term (I don&#39;t know about masters). For most people you will be financially better off if you start working straight out of ugrad and save properly than if you go to a phd program, even accounting for the pay increase from having a phd (this isn&#39;t always the case but it tends to be true). Grad school is difficult and if you are going for a phd it takes a really long time, you should only be pursuing this if you really want to do it for the right reasons. \u00a0\u00a0<br /><br />Whether your research is more applied or theoretical will be determined by whether your interests are more in applied work or theoretical work. Research for theory and applied material can be quite different, even within the same field. Where your work will lie on the spectrum between application and theory will be determined by your interests (sorry if this is also a cop-out answer).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2018-01-09T23:57:36Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/7 - 1/13", "bucket_order": 115, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-10T00:14:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jc8bbqcehb596", "subject": "<p>People\u00a0successfully do internships, graduate on time, and get into great phd programs. It can be helpful to spend a summer doing research instead of doing an internship, particularly if you start doing research later in you ugrad career, but it isn&#39;t a necessity. Your decision of whether you plan to go straight to industry or do a phd program should be based on what life path you see making yourself the most happy, there is no catch-all\u00a0right answer and no one can make that decision better than\u00a0you can.\u00a0<br /><br />No program requires a specific number of papers to get in. I know you are using hyperbole but basically no undergrads are applying with 10 publications. Very few apply with 3 or more. You should talk to professors here about what makes a good grad app since Berkeley has amazing, competitive programs and our professors are the ones admitting students. The number of publications is no where near as important as the quality of the publications and your contribution. A first author paper will be viewed with higher regard than a paper with lower authorship. Letters of rec are also very important.\u00a0<br /><br />I also caution you from ranking phd programs. While there are definitely better phd programs than others, what is most important for a phd program is the work that the group you are joining is doing. Chasing name and ranking rather than looking for the right fit is a great way to make you hate your experience and that is very bad since 4-6 years is a long time to be unhappy.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2018-01-10T00:14:18Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/7 - 1/13", "bucket_order": 115, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-01-10T00:25:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jc8bq1drnvo2as", "subject": "<p>And I also want to add that people go on to lead very happy, financially strong, successful lives where they contribute significantly to society, their families, their communities, their countries, and the greater scientific\u00a0community whether they\u00a0went to grad school or not.
