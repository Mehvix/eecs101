I got a comfortable A&#43; in 61b with Hug (and in most of the other lower divs as well) and found that leetcode medium was much, much harder than anything I saw in his class. The very hardest algorithm / lab challenge questions he gave were leetcode medium-level roughly, except often we only had to give the general algorithm instead of implementing it fully.\n\nI think the interview difficulty level comes down to a few things.\n\n1) You can get a lot better at these questions with practice. I did close to 300 problems over the summer (I didn&#39;t have much else to do and I kinda enjoy leetcode lol), and I went from struggling a ton with mediums to being able to do new mediums in 20-30 mins and maybe half the hards in &lt; 40. Once you learn the common &#34;patterns&#34; it gets a lot easier. You also get a lot better at coding the implementations. \n\n2) What I hear is that many, many interview questions are ripped straight from leetcode, and even if they&#39;re not they&#39;re probably similar to something you&#39;ve seen. Given the amount of money these companies offer, it&#39;s created a &#34;race to the bottom&#34; where people do more and more leetcode, and so the interviews get harder and harder to differentiate. Some of the harder questions are just &#34;well-known questions&#34; that you should know. Median of two sorted arrays is one of these; it has nearly 5k upvotes on leetcode. Unless you&#39;re a straight genius, I don&#39;t think someone who&#39;s never seen this question would be able to code it up in 30ish mins, because although the concept isn&#39;t too too tricky it&#39;s a hard implementation.\n\n3) I think internship interviews are much, much easier than full-time.\n\n4) Maybe cal students get the benefit of the doubt on interviews? (There have to be a crazy number of false positives for these anyways given how common leetcode cramming is.)

For example, you may encounter a problem that is not that &#34;puzzle&#34;-y but requires substantial coding, and the interviewer is looking to see your thought process, how you break down the problem and choose to organize your code. I&#39;ve personally found success in practicing for interviews by, well, doing interviews- it&#39;s most realistic when there&#39;s another person on the other side that you have to explain your thought process to clearly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to get an offer from every company you want, you just need to practice.

Are interview questions always this hard? I saw from one of the poll on EECS 101 piazza that many people didn&#39;t even practice many leetcode questions and successfully land on an internship, and Berkeley students normally can successfully find a good CS job\u00a0before\u00a0graduation. Does this mean the interview questions are normally not that bad?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0I really appreciate any\u00a0advice and help!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2019-09-02T08:28:57Z", "subject": "Feeling leetcode questions difficult?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k0256yt76y13mh", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10178, "num_favorites": 17, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545804357, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhopc26l6a8", "name": "Laiming Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6levcg63q20t", "name": "Henry Leou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1548797126, "jkjt85cc6fc4jx": 1541740603, "jko89qm4qo732a": 1543432634, "jqr7hfmf4v74e": 1552945044, "jr6wgkg4hqh19q": 1548796612}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhrzrklubu41ah", "name": "Hamza Qadeer", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j62qn8lp70n2wj", "name": "Nick Bourlier", "photo": "1506810236_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j62qn8lp70n2wj/1506810236_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyatitqleci3ey", "name": "Truong Le", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkfr8wxmo61w9", "name": "Ana Nelson", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgw2lrsc5g2", "name": "Aditya Ramkumar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1574134997, "jwslfmrdirb540": 1565228726, "jym2724oqrk2bm": 1568516245}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji3ybsgdzii5h7", "name": "Vivrd Prasanna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "name": "Jason Xie", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9s6omub10j", "name": "Jeanelle Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhopc26l6a8", "j6levcg63q20t", "jhrzrklubu41ah", "j62qn8lp70n2wj", "jyatitqleci3ey", "ipkfr8wxmo61w9", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jktvgw2lrsc5g2", "ji3ybsgdzii5h7", "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "is6p9s6omub10j"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 620}
