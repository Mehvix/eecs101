EE 16A focuses largely on linear algebra and proofs, two concepts that can be relatively challenging when applying them for the first time, and circuits (especially the labs) also tend to be fairly time-consuming to understand. CS 61A, on the other hand, is more conceptually intuitive once you get the hang on programming, while Math 53 is often just plug-and-chug of equations into different problem types (at least, my semester was taught somewhat like that). Because of that added rigor, I&#39;d estimate EE 16A to be perhaps 1.5-2x the workload of CS 61A if you&#39;ve done programming before, but maybe a similar workload if you haven&#39;t. Personally (I&#39;ve programmed before, though), I spent maybe 5-10\u00a0hours outside class/discussion/lab for EE 16A, 3-6 hours for CS 61A, and 1-2 hours for Math 53, but that was just me.</p>", "created": "2018-05-18T09:27:28Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jhbrg5dltf5677", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/13 - 5/19", "bucket_order": 106, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/13 - 5/19", "bucket_order": 106, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-18T17:30:00Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jhc8oowgijh50f", "subject": "Approximately 2/3 of ee16a is linear algebra, so if you have taken 54, it should be easy to go through that part.
