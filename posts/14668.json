These are just going to be general interest/learning classes as I won&#39;t have any issue hitting the grad requirements. I&#39;ve taken D100, 162, 170, 188, 189 and I&#39;m trying to optimize for general learning and future industry work.</p>\n<ul><li>126: I <em>feel</em> like I want to take a probability course for general statistical thinking knowledge and perhaps for recruiting purposes, but I&#39;m not sure if 126 is overload for that purpose and likely the recruiting timeline will be already started and I won&#39;t get to leverage the knowledge from this class fully. Are there other easier/lower workload probability classes that you&#39;d recommend instead? Thoughts appreciated.</li><li>161: How is this and what&#39;s the workload like? Is the content useful or interesting? I&#39;ve taken 162 and 168 already for context</li><li>164: seems interesting in the sense that it covers low-level language design stuff, but it also feels like a big workload. I also wouldn&#39;t have friends/team to take this with. Is that a dealbreaker?</li><li>182: I probably want to take this (really interested in subject matter), unless it&#39;s just a terrible class or too much work</li><li>184: seems interesting and it would be cool to make pretty pictures with. How technically and mathematically challenging is this?</li><li>186: Databases are important to know especially in industry. But this class seems overkill if I just want to know how to use databases (ie. with sql or graphql), and am not actually designing them myself.</li></ul>\n<p>Any advice on good parings of classes also recommended (eg. content complements each other or workloads are manageable together). thanks in advance!</p>", "created": "2021-04-06T23:55:11Z", "subject": "Thoughts on these upper divs?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kn6ojvrx9g75yl", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 2, "nr": 14668, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654540859101, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 824}
