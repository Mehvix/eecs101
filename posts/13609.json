Here is an email a friend of mine received from David:<br /><br />&#34;First off, thank you for your interest in the course.<br /><br />Overall, I don&#39;t know yet whether I will be able to take undergraduates. It&#39;ll depend on how many grad students show up. I limit the size of the course to enable us to have productive discussions, and graduate students have first priority for enrollment. So, it will depend on how many graduate students sign up. I will decide on the first day of classes, based on how many graduate students show up. (It is hard to predict in advance, because grad students sometimes sign up quite late.)<br /><br />If there is space available, I might take a small number of undergrads (e.g., 3-5). I will prioritize based on preparation. I usually look for undergrads who are doing well in relevant CS upper divs (e.g., A&#39;s in 161 and some subset of 162/168/169). I&#39;ll take relevant research experience or teaching experience into account as well.<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested, I suggest showing up on the first day of classes. Don&#39;t sign up in Phase 1 - don&#39;t waste your limited Phase 1 slots on this, as I will be using preparation rather than waitlist position for prioritizing enrollment.<br /><br />If you can&#39;t get into 261, you might also be interest in CS171 (Cryptography) and/or capture-the-flag cybersecurity competitions (e.g., <a href=\"https://berke1337.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://berke1337.berkeley.edu/,</a> if they&#39;re still active).<br /><br />Thank you for your interest!&#34;</p>", "created": "2020-11-03T17:43:19Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6levraiass2e1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kh29ghb6de178b", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvi1yqigu6o4", "name": "Alan Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvi1yqigu6o4"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11067": 0, "13252": 8, "13498": 1, "3641": 3, "3647": 4, "4082": 7, "5582": 6, "6407": 2, "6539": 5}}, "created": "2020-11-03T05:06:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it possible to enroll in CS261 as an undergraduate?
