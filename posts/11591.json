You will work a lot with matrices and their decompositions, specifically the SVD. Be really comfortable with invertibility and diagonalization. Half the time I felt like our problem sets involved using some form of linear algebra to prove something. \n\n2) Probability/Statistics (upperdiv level). This is also really important, but not the combinatorics or problem solving part; focus on notions like basic notions of priors/posteriors, Gaussian densities, covariance and correlation, OLS. IMO if your prob/stats background is good, then 189 will be much much easier for you than your fellow classmates. \n\n3) Optimization (math 53 level): Knowledge of partial derivatives, gradients, and basic knowledge of convexity. I&#39;d argue that optimization is probably just as important as the above two, but ultimately you don&#39;t need a high level of understanding to do well in the class.\n\nI think that generally speaking, the students who have the hardest time are those who walk in with the bare minimum prerequisites or have no prior background in statistics.
