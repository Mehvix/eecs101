It can take anywhere from same-day to 2 months. Companies vary wildly in their processing times. But do know that intern positions at large companies are often filled by early to mid october. It always arrives faster than you think so approach recruiting season at full speed! Medium and small companies finish recruiting a month or so later, with some still recruiting until late Feb., rarely end of march. Summer research also close applications by late Feb and sometimes end of march.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At-home coding tests may be given immediately or within a couple weeks usually, and need to be turned in within 3-5 days typically, but feel free to ask for extensions. Though the actual coding test time limit will still be the usual 30-90min (but if you receive learning accommodations at school, feel free to ask companies for time extensions on those tests). After the at-home test it can take another 1-14 days to get a response from the company. Basically, the key takeaway is that things can take a really, really long time, but it&#39;s also okay to email the recruiter if the deadline they&#39;ve told you has passed or if about 2 weeks have passed and you haven&#39;t heard anything. They&#39;re busy people and/or they lose track of people/paperwork sometimes.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "updated": "2019-08-27T22:05:04Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-27T20:45:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "Hi guys, as the application season is coming I have some questions regarding to the application process.\u00a0<div><br /><div>How long does it usually take to get a reply after submitting resume at on-site career fairs and recruting web sites?</div><div><br /></div><div>And when would it be that I have to expect to take coding tests after receiving a reply that I passed the document phase?</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I am asking these questions to be prepared by the time when I take the interview.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Thank you!</div>", "created": "2019-08-27T20:45:35Z", "subject": "First Internship Experience", "uid": "jvjy8h9m8yw45l"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jzuav6de2uo4ko", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10128, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545875624, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "ireb05q4pq01oe": 1, "irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "name": "Nitzan Orr", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ir6sjtqw2e51rf"], "tags": ["eecs", "other", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 408}
