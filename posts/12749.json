I took it in S20, so I can attest to the difficulties of doing teamwork remotely but not internationally. It is certainly harder to organize consistent meet ups and it is easier for work to get put off. This might be more true if members are spread across many timezones. As long as your group consist of at least 1-2 other people you can count on to carry their weight/come in clutch during heavy workload weeks, you should be fine. With that said, try to schedule coding sessions frequently and don&#39;t cheese the design docs.
