EECS 127 helps quite a lot, unlike the student response suggests. It gives a lot of useful insight into how SVMs work, convex optimization in general, as well as applications for a lot of useful facts in linear algebra (like spectral theorem, SVD, etc.). It also gets you really familiar with matrix calculus, which is used a lot in 189. In fact, I've found it to be more useful than 126 so far. 126 is still useful though. The probability intuition is really helpful for things like bias-variance decomposition, etc. I would recommend taking 126 instead of stat 134. I have not taken the latter but I am sort of familiar with the material since a close friend of mine took the course (and I helped him with some of the assignments).
