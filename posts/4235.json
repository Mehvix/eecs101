There&#39;s a breadth class I&#39;d like to take that&#39;s most likely going to be filled by my Phase 2 appointment. If I were to drop 61C right now and add it during Phase 2, how likely is it that I&#39;m going to get into the class? Will 61C be expanded to accommodate more students? I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with CS enrollment, so any insight would be great. Thanks.</p>", "created": "2017-05-18T13:44:12Z", "subject": "Safe to Drop CS 61C from WL (For P2) and Add a Breadth?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "j2ugwdhdoyqm4", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 4235, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552096280, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 328}
