Hamming is talking to people who want to advance any field as far as they can and get as much low hanging fruit as possible. Nothing wrong with this (\u201ccontributing to the sum total of human knowledge\u201d sounds slick), but you should be <em>certain</em> that you want that <em>exactly</em> and not some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1279532354499821568?lang=en\">adjacent</a> goal. See also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W9mnxeO_mNc\">Denero\u2019s final CS61A lecture</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 7 year rule is decent advice if it aligns with your goals. Unlike most advice, it\u2019s an easy heuristic to remember and apply: if I\u2019ve been thinking about the same problem for 7 years, pivot to a subfield I don\u2019t have much experience/reputation in, which might have insights or metaphors that might get me unstuck in some other field. It\u2019s still just a heuristic, though, and focused planning is a better idea. I\u2019d recommend spending a few days thinking through <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PBRWb2Em5SNeWYwwB/humans-are-not-automatically-strategic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(a)-(h) of this post</a> to make a plan. Then test your plan and revise: if a time traveller told you that you failed to achieve your goal, which part of the plan would you guess failed? Fix it and repeat. Then go test your plan. We really <em>aren\u2019t</em> automatically strategic, and dispassionately thinking about and testing plans seems like it would go a long way.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I recommend Francis Crick\u2019s autobiography, <em>What Mad Pursuit</em>. It\u2019s a lot less serious than Hamming\u2019s talk, but Crick also hopped between disciplines a few times in his life. Biology is famously unintuitive (evolution doesn\u2019t care about the simplest or most elegant solution!), and Crick\u2019s explanations of how the field developed different hypotheses and experiments is a great primer in how to approach research.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvg5rtq4e4uz"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jktvh8i561k5t7", "updated": "2021-01-28T22:02:28Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-29T01:35:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Just chiming in here to say that I think this thesis would be a fantastic basis for a panel discussion with some people who have taken different approaches to their careers.

Isn&#39;t that kind of a much more broad problem of fame? What can one do? <br />Hamming: 2<br />\u00a0Some things you could do are the following. <em>Somewhere around every seven years make a</em><br /><em>significant, if not complete, shift in your field.</em> Thus, I shifted from numerical analysis, to hardware, to <br />software, and so on, periodically, because you tend to use up your ideas. When you go to a new field, you <br />have to start over as a baby. You are no longer the big mukity muk and you can start back there and you<br />can start planting those acorns which will become the giant oaks. Shannon, I believe, ruined himself.

I said, ``Yes, he&#39;ll be just as smart, but that&#39;s<br />the end of his scientific career,&#39;&#39; and I truly believe it was. \u00a0<br />You have to change. You get tired after a while; you use up your originality in one field. You need to get<br />something nearby. I&#39;m not saying that you shift from music to theoretical physics to English literature; I <br />mean within your field you should shift areas so that you don&#39;t go stale. You couldn&#39;t get away with forcing <br />a change every seven years, but if you could, I would require a condition for doing research, being that you \u00a0<br />will 4<br />\u00a0change your field of research every seven years with a reasonable definition of what it means, or at the<br />end of 10 years, management has the right to compel you to change. I would insist on a change because I&#39;m <br />serious. What happens to the old fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on using it. They <br />were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There&#39;s the new direction; but\u00a0</p>\n<p>the old fellows are still marching in their former direction. \u00a0<br />You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints, and 5<br />before 6<br />\u00a0you use up all the old ones. You can do<br />something about this, but it takes effort and energy. It takes courage to say, ``Yes, I will give up my great <br />reputation.&#39;&#39; For example, when error correcting codes were well launched, having these theories, I said,<br />``Hamming, you are going to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to ignore it completely; you are<br />going to try and do something else other than coast on that.&#39;&#39; I deliberately refused to go on in that field. I <br />wouldn&#39;t even read papers to try to force myself to have a chance to do something else. I managed myself,\u00a0</p>\n<p>which is what I&#39;m preaching in this whole talk.

I&#39;m not saying that you shift from music to theoretical physics to English literature; I <br />mean within your field you should shift areas so that you don&#39;t go stale. You couldn&#39;t get away with forcing <br />a change every seven years, but if you could, I would require a condition for doing research, being that you \u00a0<br />will 4<br />\u00a0change your field of research every seven years with a reasonable definition of what it means, or at the<br />end of 10 years, management has the right to compel you to change. I would insist on a change because I&#39;m <br />serious. What happens to the old fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on using it. They <br />were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There&#39;s the new direction; but\u00a0</p>\n<p>the old fellows are still marching in their former direction. \u00a0<br />You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints, and 5<br />before 6<br />\u00a0you use up all the old ones. You can do<br />something about this, but it takes effort and energy. It takes courage to say, ``Yes, I will give up my great <br />reputation.&#39;&#39; For example, when error correcting codes were well launched, having these theories, I said,<br />``Hamming, you are going to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to ignore it completely; you are<br />going to try and do something else other than coast on that.&#39;&#39; I deliberately refused to go on in that field. I <br />wouldn&#39;t even read papers to try to force myself to have a chance to do something else. I managed myself,\u00a0</p>\n<p>which is what I&#39;m preaching in this whole talk. Knowing many of my own faults, I manage myself. I have a\u00a0</p>\n<p>lot of faults, so I&#39;ve got a lot of problems, i.e. a lot of possibilities of management.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My question is, to what extent is this good career planning advice? How can, indeed, one adapt his words to the current state of industry/research/EECS? His logic is sound, but somewhat non-mainstream.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>P.S. What are some other great articles on long-term career/research planning?</p>", "created": "2021-01-28T01:09:30Z", "subject": "To what extent is Richard Hamming&#39;s seven-year prescription good advice?", "uid": "kduvrrlqqk63qu"}], "history_size": 8, "i_edits": [], "id": "kkg5todrn8o1s6", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 14350, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541210991, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jxe5fr1xbyh10k", "name": "Kyle Zhang", "photo": "1600390869_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jxe5fr1xbyh10k/1600390869_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jydxjqxcuyd39a", "name": "Megan Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdz53y6yw0i1yq": 1603179564, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611580617}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c1yhm3zy7o", "name": "Ayah Ahmad", "photo": "1620709911_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ke2c1yhm3zy7o/1620709911_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrx7lxeqz3e4", "name": "Tsai-Jwu (Judy)", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jxe5fr1xbyh10k", "jydxjqxcuyd39a", "ke2c1yhm3zy7o", "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "j6lrx7lxeqz3e4"], "tags": ["research", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 453}
