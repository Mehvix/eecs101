EE 16A/B are really unique classes with a mixture of topics from various disciplines (Linear algebra, circuits, materials science (they began teaching about physical properties of semiconductors), differential eqs., etc.). In community colleges you may find some of these topics covered\u00a0singularly in a class (Diff eq. class, or a circuits class, etc.) but not all in one.\u00a0I don&#39;t think they accept coursework for this class outside of Berkeley, and this is generally true of the EECS lower division requirements. I think, in rare cases, coursework is accepted for 61B, but\u00a0anyone you ask will probably advise you not to take a requirement elsewhere as this is one of the best schools in the world for EECS.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-10-05T18:54:05Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-05T18:15:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is there any community college where I can take EE 16B and transfer it to Cal?</p>", "created": "2019-10-05T18:15:52Z", "subject": "EE 16B in a Community College", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k1dvouzob606w5", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10354, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545698037, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4v1umgas6rl", "name": "Kevin Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrz5qj7ff4j8", "name": "David Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6d4v1umgas6rl", "j3nrz5qj7ff4j8"], "tags": ["eecs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 282}
