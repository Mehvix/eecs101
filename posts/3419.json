For 162, there was either a homework, design doc, or project due every other week, and it was perfect because 189 psets were due in the weeks in between 162 assignments were due. Of course this basically meant I was constantly working.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>189 had 1 midterm, 1 final last semester, and 162 had 3 midterms.
