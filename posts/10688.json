If this gives you any reference, I used to TA for a class with discussions and labs. Discussion TAs that were hired for 8 hrs did 2 hours of actual discussion per week normally, with 1 hr office hours, 2 hours prep (for both discussion prep and office hour prep), and 3 hrs allocated for general exam prep, such as writing the exam, debugging, proctoring, and grading (this number would be much higher closer to exams but then drop once the prior exam was graded, with the goal of averaging to 3). Even with all the lab TAs as well, exam prep still took a long time. Even with all this, I saw plenty of TAs averaging many more hours to try and make everything the best as possible for students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For 15 hours, it would be\u00a0double discussion and office hours, with possibly more responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Some examples of other tasks:</p>\n<p>-Creating discussions/labs and debugging them</p>\n<p>-Maintaining course resources and notes and such</p>\n<p>-Review sessions</p>\n<p>-Piazza (I&#39;ve met TAs whose main job was piazza)</p>\n<p>-Managing readers</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The readers are also a big factor here. In big courses with weekly homeworks, readers grade your homework. I&#39;ve seen readers hired for 3 hrs to 12 hrs depending the course and amount of readers, so this is also a factor too</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you wanna try to model this with a function, look at big webcasted courses and look at the following numbers:</p>\n<p>-Total number of TAs, plus the breakdown between primary tasks</p>\n<p>-Total number of readers (harder to find out)</p>\n<p>-Max size of discussion and lab sections, along with the number of hours for each per week</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR: EECS course staff (TA&#39;s and more) are ridiculously hard working and do more than just teach sections, so limits can come from many sides. We never have enough money to hire all the TAs needed, but professors often try to get more to expand the course, so we don&#39;t even know what the max number of TA&#39;s is. Max number of students to enroll though is just whatever it says on classes.berkeley.edu until they change it, in which case that will update</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_6", "updated": "2019-11-02T01:52:30Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-11-01T00:21:42Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k2fe7h5x70p4ok", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Follow-up question: What is the upper bound on the number of students that can enroll?
