I\u00a0sat a lot in office hours for help. Then you also have the time spent in lectures and discussions (which I found useful both courses, so definitely attend).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Math110, I went to every lecture. The textbook was pretty good, but there was still some proofs that I couldn&#39;t quite get while reading, and the professor (who was not Paulin so people might say differently) did a good job of explaining things. In my semester of 110,\u00a0we didn&#39;t actually turn in the homeworks, so I would spend about 2-3 hours trying the problems on my own, but I wouldn&#39;t stress if I couldn&#39;t figure one out, because when the solutions were released, I&#39;d spend about another 2 hours reviewing the solutions for the problems I couldn&#39;t figure out. Then I also went to the once a week discussion (because of required quizzes) and stayed for the problems in the last half because they were helpful.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>So 110 was definitely the least workload if the same homework policy is in place next semester (I don&#39;t know whose teaching).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One note: be prepared that 127 will be a bit harder in the beginning of the semester. It requires a more proof based understanding of linear algebra than simply 54 gives you. I took 127 the semester after 110 and felt perfectly comfortable with the material, but expect that if you&#39;ve only had 54 you&#39;ll need a few weeks at the beginning of the semester to get use to thinking about linear algebra in a more abstract way. I love linear algebra,\u00a0 so I really enjoyed 110&#43;127 - they really teach you a TON of linear algebra.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is9ein4lpno52m", "updated": "2019-12-20T04:12:13Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-12-20T02:31:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k4djf0bpzvv5e1", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thank you ou for the in-depth answer!
