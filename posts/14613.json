I personally also don&#39;t need the course to teach any special material (e.g. codes for storage in data centers) -- I work in applied communications (integrated circuits) and would just like some fundamental coverage of the material listed in the course description, as it isn&#39;t really covered substantively in any of 120, 123, 126, etc. I&#39;m not going to get into why telling undergrads to take graduate-level coursework just because the corresponding undergraduate-level course is basically never offered is problematic... but it is problematic. And then there&#39;s the issue that 229A is not even a like-for-like substitute for 121.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The justification for most of the weird undergraduate curriculum manipulations and omissions this department engages in is that there simply isn&#39;t enough interest in EE at the undergrad level, and that this is a result of external factors rather than the policies of the department. But I think the problem is very clear, and it&#39;s that undergrad EE admissions are lumped in with the most competitive undergrad admissions process at this university (&#34;EECS&#34;). I can give n many examples of EE being perfectly popular among undergrads at other universities (and among graduate students at this university), but if what I&#39;m saying is falling on deaf ears (and it is), it literally doesn&#39;t matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The department has basically gerrymandered and/or vote-suppressed undergrad EE majors away, and this would be hilarious if it wasn&#39;t so depressing and in violation of the university&#39;s charter (<a href=\"https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/CalHistory/charter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">end of Section 1 here</a>). But I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, considering that, for the greater part of a decade, the department has seen undergrad CS enrollment boom and has legitimately thought it would be more or less temporary, apparently without the slightest bit of introspection on the state of this country (and its economy) and the material conditions of its people. /endrant (lol)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jq7jsbycx8b7ke": 1549340056}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6h4hugwlvg6cg", "name": "Eric Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jykoiw12p0p400", "name": "Prachi Deo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzccscx0iwb5wb", "name": "David Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6h4hugwlvg6cg", "jykoiw12p0p400", "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "jzccscx0iwb5wb"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-04-01T14:02:14Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/28 - 4/3", "bucket_order": 56, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-01T19:48:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kmzajkabjzi7ey", "subject": "<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the fault of the school nearly as much as us, the students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you talk to new EECS freshmen, a surprisingly large number of them come in undecided and will tell you they&#39;re interested in a mix of EE and CS. What happens very quickly is that they realize:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. EE doesn&#39;t pay very well and isn&#39;t &#34;cool&#34; (no mind-bogging 6-figure RSUs or company shuttles or arcades at work)\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. EE is harder than most non-HFT/quant software jobs</p>\n<p>3. EE requires not only being decent at coding, but also troubleshooting electronic hardware (some people find out in 16 that they&#39;re absolutely terrible with their hands)</p>\n<p>4.

A lot of modern EE is basically coding and algorithms for electromagnetic applications, but if you&#39;re already passable at coding, why wouldn&#39;t you become a SWE for double the pay and hype? To many people, EE seems like extra work for nothing more than intellectual satisfaction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That said, the department is doing a decent job of still offering the EE core (which I would personally consider 105, 117, 120, 123, 126, 130).

The argument I&#39;m making is that the department has a responsibility to select students to study EE that will legitimately want to study it. Sure, the mechanical engineering and chemistry departments see a lot of their students switch to CS as well. But why aren&#39;t those departments basically empty like EE? The simple answer is that they have autonomy and can, for the most part, select students that will stick with their majors through undergrad.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the commitment isn&#39;t binding, plenty of freshmen will &#34;express interest&#34; in EE and then never actually follow through with studying it. It&#39;s a bit like trying to get someone to attend an infosession: if they don&#39;t actually want to attend, they won&#39;t bother. At the moment, the department is trying to &#34;convince&#34; otherwise uninterested students to take the EE path through the 16 series, which is one linear algebra course spread out over two semesters, with just enough circuits material thrown in to thoroughly confuse and disorient most students. Not only is the 16 series not representative of real EE (as seen in the upper-divs), but it fails at this core goal of convincing students to study EE as well. This is because the &#34;convincing&#34; strategy just really doesn&#39;t work in practice, or at least not at levels necessary to yield robust enrollment. I would even argue that, for all the plaudits CS 10 and the 61 series get for making CS exciting and accessible or whatever, if software suddenly wasn&#39;t as lucrative a field as it is now, enrollments and general interest in these classes would plummet.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And while having the EE faculty outnumber the undergrads is nice in some ways, it leads directly to course offering issues like this one. I&#39;ll also mention that, even if the courses you mentioned are offered on an annual (or close to annual) basis, there is basically no effort placed to schedule the offerings so that undergrads can take them in a coherent manner (e.g. just about every professor wants to teach in the spring). In any case, I just don&#39;t think this is a problem you can pin solely on the students. All I&#39;m saying is that, if the department wanted more EE undergrads, it could have that -- all that is required is that EE uses the same admissions process as just about every other field out there (at this university and most others).</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["k1zl10wlpt9gd", "jzqdhqjfxui43k"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-04-01T20:34:21Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-01T06:54:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kmyivxgefwh1xn", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I had the same question as you two years back, and at the time the best answer was @3851 (which was posted four years ago).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A quote from the post: &#34;currently, those of us who can teach it are in high demand to teach other things that have higher priority&#34;.
