There are ~100 seats that are open to all majors, which have all been filled at this point. All the unused reserved seats for EECS, COE, and LSCS juniors and seniors will be released on December 11 and the waitlist will process automatically by position. It&#39;s up to you if you can wait it out and if it&#39;s worth using your Phase I over other classes you want to take for spring. Regardless, I would absolutely monitor the enrollment and waitlist through to December 11. You can adjust your schedule during Open Hours.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "ibtip4ceues3g0", "updated": "2015-10-30T22:40:22Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-10-30T22:37:48Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ige8qgg6gn95pp", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>&#64;593\u00a0does\u00a0not appear to be available; did it get deleted or hidden?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h", "updated": "2015-10-30T22:37:48Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-10-30T17:57:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["16a"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Not sure if I should go for another class or stay on the waitlist.
