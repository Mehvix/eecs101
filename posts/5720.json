I did take cog sci 1 though, so I&#39;m not the perfect person to answer this question. IMO It&#39;s more so the mindset of how to approach human cognition rather than having prerequisite knowledge.\u00a0 If you&#39;ve taken something like philos 3, mcb 61/64, cog sci 1,or anything along the lines of mind/cognition you will be fine.\u00a0 That being said, I would imagine that it&#39;s not really necessary to do well in this class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Content-wise this class is a 10/10, I enjoyed every second of every lecture. The professor is a reallyyy good lecturer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Workload is virtually none, there was one paper that was 3 or 4 pages max that was designing your own hypothetical experiment based on some perceptual phenomenon you&#39;ve experienced and are curious about, or something like that.\u00a0 The grading on that is all about your gsi so make sure your gsi likes your idea and you are good on that. I don&#39;t\u00a0remember if there were any other assignments other than that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Exams are 100% multiple choice and are\u00a0pretty nit picky on the details but it&#39;s definitely doable.\u00a0 One thing I&#39;ll say is that he mentioned in the beginning of the semester that &#34;98% of the exam material is based on lecture&#34; and he is not exaggerating in the slightest when he says this. Every bit of detail he gives in lecture is fair game and most likely will appear on the exam. With that, he does do webcasts (audio only) so 200% of your studying should be just listening to those.\u00a0 Even though he does do webcasts it is very very important that you still go to lecture because a lot of the material is on videos and visual demos given in class so pay extra attention to those so you remember what they are when you re-listen to the webcasts.\u00a0He only uploads slides (in black&#43;white which can be annoying for things involving color) but doesn&#39;t include any of the videos and stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tl;dr it&#39;s an amazing class, take it if you can get in. Make sure you go to all the lectures</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>P.S My GSI told me when I took it that the professor doesn&#39;t respond to emails basically ever so don&#39;t count on that one.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-12-10T07:35:35Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jb0gft6wzjw19m", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ja1ym0oeuey71s": 1521850327, "jcfrsqcwoyyi5": 1525368792, "jtg9c0ed8yh13k": 1557600730}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy9vp1dhyxfpl", "name": "William Curtin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijkkw63x8n73by", "name": "Cindy Yuan", "photo": "1493576917_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ijkkw63x8n73by/1493576917_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1525153666, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1527030308, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1525109355, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1539234857}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9v8jj8x141", "name": "Mohammed Shaikh", "photo": "1515230849_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9v8jj8x141/1515230849_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jikxm3bf5jw5sl": 1533923983}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz5sg0uyjusd", "name": "David", "photo": "1444890456_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hz5sg0uyjusd/1444890456_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ij3pfeuht2js", "name": "Kachi Onyeador", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iy9vp1dhyxfpl", "ijkkw63x8n73by", "is6p9v8jj8x141", "hz5sg0uyjusd", "j6ij3pfeuht2js"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/10 - 12/16", "bucket_order": 129, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 5/6 - 5/12", "bucket_order": 108, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-06T06:26:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jgufouggptn15v", "subject": "<p>Taking this class now, can attest completely accurate.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hz5sg0uyjusd", "updated": "2018-05-06T06:26:13Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-10T07:47:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jb0guzmljpv2a2", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thanks so much for your detailed response!!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2017-12-10T07:47:23Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-12-07T05:43:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Has anyone taken Cog Sci c126 Perception (as a non cog sci major)?
