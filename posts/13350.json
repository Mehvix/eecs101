First, I want to acknowledge that I&#39;m not playing dramatic or pretentious here. Before I took 16B, I heard very bad comments on the course like many of you did. But while I was taking it, I have to say that it&#39;s a legit introductory EE course that has enlightening aspects. Even the labs were indeed notoriously tedious when something didn&#39;t work and I had to debug and rewired or ran after my little deviating car around my house seemingly that I was taking PE rather than EE course. But the remote labs were still managed very well and accessible. The staff paid a lot of attention to us and tried their best to accommodate our needs. To many students that 16B may be a class with very boring and basic materials, but to me who had no prior experience on EE and signals, forgot most Physics stuff and just focused on CS sides and originally took the class only to fulfill the requirement, 16B really led me to a new understanding of the world of EE (but I still decide to focus on CS since EE is still too hard for me). Most importantly, after spending too much time on the Digital side with 0s and 1s, 16B reminds me of the beauty of the Analog. Maybe I didn&#39;t answer your questions well but I still recommend you taking it sooner than later even under the remote setting.</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrzcn2opc4m9", "name": "Dany Itani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j3nrzcn2opc4m9"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-10-16T05:40:50Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11401": 4, "11953": 9, "12414": 6, "12728": 0, "12772": 3, "2223": 8, "3372": 2, "4338": 7, "556": 1, "959": 5}}, "created": "2020-10-14T17:57:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope you are all hanging in there.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Can current 16B students please tell me what the atmosphere looks like in 16B?
