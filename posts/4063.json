Their response basically amounted to &#34;be patient, keep an eye out for open spots- we will see what we can do&#34;. It&#39;s definitely not an issue of space- there are 425 seats in 2050 VLSB compared to the class capacity of 325. I think the reason why there&#39;s no waitlist for 110 (or any math class with discussion for that matter) is because they also ran into enrollment issues with kids getting stuck on the waitlist indefinitely while not knowing that their discussion was full.</p>", "created": "2017-04-29T20:51:50Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p><a href=\"https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/advising\">https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/advising</a></p>\n<p>Looks like all the math department staff is on floor 9 in Evans.
