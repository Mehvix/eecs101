There are definitely still lots of companies looking for interns. For summer research, I&#39;d go with the usual advice of trying to email some professors and grad students whose projects you find interesting. You&#39;ll probably get a higher response rate from the grad students than the professors, but it&#39;s still worth trying to email the professors as well. For research at other universities, you could perhaps try applying to some NSF REUs, but I don&#39;t know much about them. Best of luck!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "ijbyyqoowfj720", "updated": "2018-02-27T04:35:48Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-02-26T23:03:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs", "research", "peer_directed", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I can&#39;t find an internship lol (pls advice) so I&#39;m gonna take classes and stay in Berkeley and try to be productive. of cs160, cs188, and cs189 which combo or solo one of these classes would be good to take during the summer?
