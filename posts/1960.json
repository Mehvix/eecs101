I&#39;m one of the course staff for Data 8 so maybe I can help. We do recommend that Data 8 won&#39;t be completely worth your time if you have done more advanced coursework than just CS 61A, however, our focus isn&#39;t completely on the computer science side of things, but rather statistical analysis of data and using programming to help you develop insights about data and trends. If this sounds like something you&#39;d be interested in, you can definitely take the class, though you might find the assignments themselves on the easy side for at least the first few weeks.
