I\u2019m planning to get the applications done to become an L&amp;S student in addition to my home college sometime early this coming semester. I already completed 61A, 61B, and 70 with a 3.3 average last summer, but I did not submit a declaration application nor join L&amp;S at the time because I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to commit to a simultaneous degree, but now I am sure that it is what I want. After reading the CS declaration policies on the EECS website, I was confused if I am still allowed to apply and get approved for a CS major once I join L&amp;S, since the website mentions that the deadline to submit the CS declaration is the semester when one completed the last of the 61AB/70 requirements, which was last summer for me. However, I\u2019m not sure if this applies to me, since I wasn\u2019t even in L&amp;S at the time.<div><br /></div><div>In short, as long as I complete my paperwork by the end of this coming semester, will I be able to declare L&amp;S CS?
