We&#39;re still in the very early stages of figuring out what might be in this class, but here is a brief description:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tiny.cc/data-engg-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a><a href=\"https://tiny.cc/data-engg-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a><a href=\"https://tiny.cc/data-engg-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://tiny.cc/data-engg-info</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the highest level, the goal of the class is to act as a systems complement to algorithmic data 100, and to act as a user-facing/data sci-lifecycle complement to more database internals-y cs186. So there will definitely be some overlap with cs186, but the exact extent of overlap is not clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Edit: I spoke to Joe this AM, and our current take is that we are\u00a0<strong>discouraging</strong>\u00a0students who have taken cs186 from taking data engineering.\u00a0 In the future, there may be less overlap between the two classes, so a typical sequencing might be to take data engineering and then cs186.\u00a0 But for now, this will allow us to factor out whatever we think is most important for the data engineering class without worrying about the overlap.</p>\n<p>&#34;&#34;&#34;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>", "created": "2020-10-13T18:55:58Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j3jn0rk05ds5jm"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kg8bt0s2ox779", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdjl24y7f5nf", "name": "Amritansh Saraf", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzqdjl24y7f5nf"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-10-14T01:35:46Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kg8q35n68tx3jy", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Prereqs are Data 100 or CS 189 or some info grad classes (I don&#39;t remember the specifics) and basic programming like 61A or 88.
