As you learn more about probability and estimation, you will be able to understand things better. But in a nutshell, the policies are such that in this context, there is no value in strategizing in any way vis-a-vis graduate school admission.\n \nJust do the simple thing: be well and take care of yourself. Try your best, taking things day by day given your evolving local circumstances. As far as the class goes, focus on understanding and learning the material. If you can keep up, keep up. Attend everything that you can possibly attend --- we are providing ample capacity in the lectures, discussions and HW parties for people to get help. If you fall behind, try and catch up as you can --- go to HW parties and get help. But don&#39;t stress about anything. We understand that in this chaotic era, anything can happen and everything could be completely different for you in a few days (we have already experienced these shifts!). So just do your best as you can, the world will do its thing. \n \nNow, on to your specific question. (Fully answering it properly is a shade out of the scope of 70, because you need the maturity of 126 to really understand this properly in a quantitative way.) You will be learning about the idea of posterior distributions (after you&#39;ve observed something) as well as prior distributions (the state of your knowledge before you have observed something). Graduate schools will observe your entire transcript, in which CS70 is just a tiny thing and even this semester is just a small part of your total record. 70 is also a lower-division course, and so the nature of the course is such that there is a serious limit in how much positive persuasive power good grades can have. (In that even an exceptionally good grade here has almost no persuasive power.) Under the policies that have been adopted, a &#34;P&#34; or &#34;NP&#34; on your transcript in 70 has essentially no negative persuasive power as well. Why? Because of two things:\n \n(a) they see a bunch more grades on your entire transcript --- think of them looking at your grades in an order in which they look at all the other grades first, and look at the 70 grade last. (Order doesn&#39;t matter, but this can help you think about this more clearly.) Is the grade in 70 going to matter? The chance of it being able to push you over the top into the admit category is extremely tiny. So the only question is whether it can get you vetoed. \n \n(b) As far as they are concerned, maybe you got this &#34;P&#34; or &#34;NP&#34; because your Internet connection died for a critical week, maybe you got it because a family member or you got sick, maybe you got it because you had caregiving responsibilities, maybe you got it because you were completely freaked out along with a large fraction of the population, and maybe you got it because you don&#39;t understand the material that well. There is very little negative persuasive power of the 70 grade of &#34;P&#34; or &#34;NP.&#34; So in the context of the Covid-19-induced chaotic era, they aren&#39;t going to care at all.\n \nIf they want to know how well you know probability, they&#39;ll just look at your grade in 126. They won&#39;t care about a &#34;P&#34; in 70. And if you&#39;re going to grad school in any related area, you&#39;re going to be taking 126 anyway. So just relax about your grade in 70. Focus on understanding the material. If you&#39;re not going to grad school in any related area, they don&#39;t care about your 70 grade anyway except as a general measure of strength. But for the reasons above, seeing &#34;P&#34; or even &#34;NP&#34; this semester tells someone very little about your strength. It&#39;s like it isn&#39;t even there. \n \nThe people who are really going to be hurt by this chaotic semester are primarily going to be people who just don&#39;t understand the material that well because of everything that is going on. And that is unfortunate, but it is not about grading or grades. The material is important, but it isn&#39;t more important that your health or the well being of those around you. So our policies are designed to eliminate all the downsides to you that we can actually control. \n \nThis is a long answer that boils down to: relax, focus on living day by day, sincerely try to learn the material as best as you can in the circumstances that you face, and trust that we thought all these things through. You&#39;re a student, enjoy being a student. Let the Professors take care of our side of this. &#34;\n \n </md>", "created": "2020-03-26T08:54:04Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jzuizc8yyyt5bw"}], "id": "k88isr3awqm49y", "is_tag_endorse": false,
