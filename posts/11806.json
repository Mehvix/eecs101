It&#39;s not an ideal answer, but it&#39;s likely that since we don&#39;t have enrollment priority, we can just phase 1 and hope for the best, or stick with classes and see if people drop, or just accept that we won&#39;t be able to use the super popular/smaller classes/things that typically don&#39;t get expanded to complete our minors :/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since you&#39;re trying for EECS, I would imagine the upper div caveat is somewhat identical, but if there are EE specific classes you&#39;re interested in, it might be worthwhile to check out their enrollment history on Berkeleytime or poke around piazza with a search for &#39;phase 1&#39; and see if there are any trends you can find on which EE classes are more likely to have open seats for students that don&#39;t fit into any of the reserved categories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>good luck~</p>", "created": "2020-04-14T01:59:50Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jzikr5mlo9k42"}], "id": "k8z9d86j6vw7ad", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-14T03:52:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>The student answer is good.\u00a0 There are also other warnings on the minor homepage.
