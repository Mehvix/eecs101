From what I saw of the class, it\u00a0seems like taking it without 120 would be a very bad idea. The class (at least what I saw of it) kind of\u00a0breezed through 2D Fourier Transforms and 2D filtering, and didn&#39;t explain them in much detail (maybe they were covered in more depth later in the class?), certainly nowhere near how much 120 guides you in understanding 1D filtering.\u00a0I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s partially by the nature of it being a graduate course, so there&#39;s\u00a0little if any hand-holding. 16B really doesn&#39;t\u00a0do Fourier/LTI stuff justice because it doesn&#39;t have the time to (yes,\u00a016B covers DFT and LTI systems/convolution, but at a very cursory level compared to 120\u00a0which spends the entire first third of the class on LTI systems followed by an entire month of Fourier analysis), so I can&#39;t imagine attempting to understand some of that stuff in 2D without first gaining comfort with the tamer 1D versions in 120.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>123&#39;s coverage of wavelets and other advanced SP stuff would probably be useful to have beforehand as well, but is not nearly as fundamental/necessary as what 120 gives you, in my opinion.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p8zl3nphb8", "updated": "2019-01-18T05:50:23Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-18T01:48:00Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am an undergrad who is planning on taking EE225B: Digital Image Processing.
