The logistics should be the same, you just apply online and submit the same materials as those coming in with their Bachelor&#39;s... not sure if that&#39;s helpful? But regarding the rest:</p>\n<ul><li>Generally, the most important thing the admissions committee wants to see is evidence of your research ability, which in general comes across via a rec letter from another researcher whose opinion they can gauge &amp; ideally trust.</li><li>You want at least one great letter\u00a0talking about your research experience. What&#39;s in the the rest is less crucial; I think those can just be general recommendation letters, and they won&#39;t really matter much. (Just make sure the rest don&#39;t suggest negative things about you.) For that one-great-letter though, my impression is most industry letters won&#39;t be able to do that, unless it&#39;s by (say) a researcher in industry.</li><li>I would <em>guess</em>\u00a0(though don&#39;t know) that if you apply after industry, they might want to see more recent research experience from you, so your paper from undergrad might carry less weight as time goes on. But you should confirm this with someone who&#39;s more knowledgeable about this.</li><li>Don&#39;t forget it&#39;s possible to apply and defer your admission for a year in many schools. I think usually you want to only bring this up after you&#39;re admitted, but you should chat with some people who know more about this if 1 year is a similar timeline to what you&#39;d consider.</li><li>To get a rec letter, just go up to your PI (or email, especially given the current situation) and (nicely, but no need to be over the top) ask if they&#39;d be willing to write you a rec letter for grad school. The exact phrasing (&#34;willing&#34; or &#34;able&#34;? &#34;strong letter&#34; or just &#34;letter&#34;? etc.) isn&#39;t worth worrying about IMO, though I&#39;m sure some will beg to differ... it&#39;s something you can debate for all eternity, and my phrasing might not be optimal, but unless you have some legit reason to think they would be willing to write you a weak letter but not a strong one, I wouldn&#39;t care about it.</li></ul>", "created": "2020-03-20T22:38:00Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gj3b0ds4tG4"}], "id": "k80rl8bnl0u5ud", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jw6kndsic346lm": 1562983101}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3h2nh0k3ho", "name": "Nikhil Jain", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipg4v9637934v6", "name": "Thomas Liao", "photo": "1518481246_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ipg4v9637934v6/1518481246_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6nu3h2nh0k3ho", "ipg4v9637934v6"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-03-21T04:18:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k813qszekxp5bg", "subject": "<p>Existence is one thing,\u00a0whereas finding and obtaining these positions is another.

I don&#39;t really know if there&#39;s a blanket statement that can be made here.
