I know this is highly discouraged and not necessarily a good idea but hear me out. I have sufficient knowledge of the material in CS 169A. I have experience with all the technologies used in the class i.e HTML, CSS, JavaScript (front-end) and Ruby on Rails &#43; Node.js (backend). Basically, I consider myself a full-stack web-developer and I frequently experiment with web-apps. If CS 169A is what I think it is, then am pretty certain that I will be able to do the homework and not struggle on the projects giving me enough time to focus on both CS 162 and CS 161. The other alternative would be to take a breadth class which would help me fully focus on 162 &amp; 161 but I think 169 would be a really cool class for me to take and am really just passionate about the material. In addition, It would help me get more EECS upper-div units. Am I under-estimating the workload for CS 169A at all? Here&#39;s what my schedule would look like if I did so:\n\n- CS 162 - 4 units \n- CS 161 - 4 units\n- CS 169 - 3 units\n- Ethics Requirement - 1 unit\n\nvs\n\n- CS 162 - 4 units\n- CS 161 - 4 units\n- Breath - 4 units\n- Ethics Requirement - 1 unit\n\nTl;dr?
