My feeling is that his class is more suitable for the students who already had experiences of handling side projects outside the class. You need a certain level of skills and intuition about how to debug your code and kinda enjoy the process of doing it. If that&#39;s that&#39;s the case, you will pretty much learn a ton of knowledge about data structure and in the same time gain experiences of handling large projects that will eventually benefit you when u enter the industry. However, if you consider yourself not that mature on programming and lack patience and skills of debugging the code, it&#39;s better off to either take with Hug or lower your workload next semester. I took 3 technicals that semester and suffered a lot\u00a0mentally and physically. Even though I went through it and managed a good grade, I still feel extremely shaky and unconfident about my understanding of data structures, since I spent way too long time fixing those silly, funky bugs of my code. Some of my friends scored below 50% in every exam but still ended up with an A because they put a ton of work the projects.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-08-01T16:36:58Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-07-31T20:09:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;ve heard Hilfinger&#39;s projects are notorious for being difficult and time-consuming, are they all individual or are some of them partner-based?
