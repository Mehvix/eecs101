By knowing more proofs and how more problems were approached, you will be able to improve.</p>\n<p>2. Probability. The biggest part of the CS 70 final is probability. If you have been keeping up with the homework and actually thinking about the questions, it will give you a leg up in the exam. If not, review all the homework problems and understand how to solve them (don&#39;t just understand the solution, but the approach as well). Be confident taking integrals and derivatives to convert from CDF and PDF. Know the various distributions by heart.</p>\n<p>3. Cheat sheet. Be sure to include Markov&#39;s/Chebyshev&#39;s Inequality and CLT. Be sure to write down the CDF, PDFs, variances, and means of all the distributions you covered.
