It\u2019s important to note that the course is not solely oriented around machine learning, though the latter half of the course does feature it heavily. Although the instructors went over the derivations for techniques like Linear and Logistic Regressions, they mostly stressed the high-level ideas involved, such as the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and Feature-Engineering. If you\u2019re looking for a pure ML class, go with 189.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I\u2019d say one of the more valuable things I took away from the class was that I learned to work machine learning libraries like Tensor Flow and Sci-Kit Learn, which was super fun. We had 2 labs on TensorFlow (I think) and 1 on SciKit Learn, as well as a Kaggle competition HW, where we had the chance to apply a lot of the techniques we learned. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To answer your question, yes, the introduction into ML that the course gives you should be enough to get you started on applying ML to your own work, but the course is by no means a comprehensive overview of all of ML.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would suggest looking at the <a href=\"http://www.ds100.org/sp17/syllabus\" target=\"_blank\">past syllabus</a>\u00a0to see exactly what we covered last semester.</p>\n<p>Hope that helped!</p>", "created": "2017-07-29T02:55:35Z", "subject": "", "uid": "idriliib5fi4kc"}], "id": "j5opfl24zvp6f7", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irb7tdf9t6c20y", "name": "Franklin Heng", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["irb7tdf9t6c20y"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 7/23 - 7/29", "bucket_order": 143, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-07-29T19:08:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j5po6h1yxps2ob", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>On the website it says, CS 61A and Math 54 are pre-reqs (which I have taken), do you think I should take CS 61B before taking Data 100?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2017-07-29T19:08:16Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-07-27T21:26:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "cs", "suggestion_box", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi,\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For anyone who has taken CS C100, I was wondering how much machine learning concepts the class goes over?
