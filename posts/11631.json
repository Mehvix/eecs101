I guess my frame of reference is that I was recruiting &#43; taking 186 and 16b concurrently, so relative to those it was much much nicer. I do agree that the material taught in 188 is challenging, and exams are challenging as a result. \n\nIn comparison to 170 and 186 specifically, I thought that the material in 170 was a bit more difficult than 188 and I spent way more time on problem sets each week, but a benefit was that it was only psets and nothing else.
