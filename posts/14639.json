A lot of the times EE uses a lot of low level languages like C&#43;&#43;/C for designing embedded systems and usually a high level language like Python to test/script the devices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For EE generally, <strong>take EE120 first</strong>. It is an IMPORTANT foundational class for any EE class at Berkeley or in general. Take it in Spring 2022 when Babak teaches it. Best teacher I&#39;ve ever had in Cal and you&#39;ll learn so much.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you like the circuits part of Module 1 -- Take <strong>105 -&gt; 140</strong>.\u00a0 You don&#39;t need EE120 to do 105/140 so you can slot this in whenever in your schedule. I think 105 has you to design an op-amp from transistors and 140&#39;s final project is designing a cadence amplier from scratch. 140 is enough for you to get a job in analog design anywhere. Apple sponsors 140 and recruits students from the class directly too.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you like Module 2 (controls) -- Take 128 and 106A-106B series. 128 is a feedback control class where you learn different techniques of frequency based design and some pretty cool controls in general. Kinda theoritical but the final project when I took it had you code up a controller on a drone to track differnt things. 106A-B is a robotics based class where you learn imaging, controls, kinematics, etc. 106A is mostly linear algebra and theory (pretty low workload and straightforward) where 106B focuses more on research and implementing hard theories learnt in class and from 106A. 106B is significantly more rewarding but is also significantly harder and time consuming (am currently dying in 106B).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you like Module 3 -- Take 127/189</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For signal processing, 127/126 is pretty useless as you would wanna take 123 where 120 is a prereq that isn&#39;t enforced but I don&#39;t see how you can do it without 120 (I&#39;m in the class rn). Maybe 126 can be somewhat useful since noise is present in signal processing daily and learning to deal with that is a nice touch but 126 is an overkill. 123 is a great class and the labs are awesome. You can actually do some sick signal processing with a cheap hardware 123 gives you to decode airplane locations and signals.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For digital design, look into <strong>61C -&gt; 151</strong>. 151 is regarded as THE class to take if you wanna do hardware engineer. Literally just by having this class in your resume, every hardware company wants to interview you instantly. The class is a 5 unit class where you learn Verilog and a lot of low-level design. Apple also sponsors this class by giving out free airpods for the best designs in the final project and recruits students from this class (myself and my friends in Fa20). Caution, its a really hard class since the learning curve is steep.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think outside of the EE classes, I think it would be generally useful to take CS162 to supplement the EE route. A lot of EE is system designs and 162 is pretty useful for you to learn and implement an entire operating system. Throw in CS170 too if you have time cause optimizing algorithms is also a big part of EE.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpbl6kvl2aq", "name": "Rohin Tangirala", "photo": "1600201004_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnpbl6kvl2aq/1600201004_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "name": "Anusha Subramanian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzkuyr7saqi641", "name": "Lincoln Too", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kb6v0zyfq4u3j1", "name": "Kaung Si Thu", "photo": "1634422498_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kb6v0zyfq4u3j1/1634422498_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnpbl6kvl2aq", "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "jzkuyr7saqi641", "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "kb6v0zyfq4u3j1"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-04-03T20:28:44Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/28 - 4/3", "bucket_order": 37, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-03T21:27:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kn28yuj4dy579y", "subject": "<p>For signal processing, you NEED to have 151.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Signal processing with general-purpose x86 hardware has basically evolved into machine learning, so most SP work nowadays involves real-time data processing.

I was wondering if I should swap out math 53 for ee105 instead so cs61c, ee120, and ee105? Should I try to fit math 53 in the next few semesters or just self study? thank you so much!!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-04-17T18:54:03Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-04-02T17:19:14Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kn0knaakfe741i", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What part of EE16B do you like?
