It&#39;s highly physics-based, and IMO shares more with courses in the MechE department than almost anything in EECS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>106A covers chapters 2, 3, and a bit of 4 in this book:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/MLS/pdf/mls94-complete.pdf\">https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/MLS/pdf/mls94-complete.pdf</a></p>\n<p>106B covers chapters 4, 5, and 6 among other things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Classes that would provide a useful background for 106B (in lieu of or in conjunction with 106A) are EE 128, ME 175, ME 136, ME 193B, and potentially EE 149 or 192 (I haven&#39;t taken either, but there&#39;s likely a little bit of overlap). 106B is a very difficult / time-intensive class, but is very rewarding if you push through.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Professor Sahai talks a lot about &#34;mathematical\u00a0maturity&#34; in the context of 189, and I think many of the same arguments apply to 106B. If you have a very strong background in linear algebra and differential equations, as well as strong physical intuition and a good programming background, it&#39;s possible to take 106B without 106A. We get a number of grad students (mostly controls students in the MechE department) who do this successfully every spring. However, we&#39;ve had very high drop rates every semester the class has been offered, even from students who did well in 106A, so if you choose to try it, watch out.</p>", "created": "2018-10-10T07:55:29Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i09a0mpvrV6"}], "id": "jn2v0dnm8dc4x0", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvh2vkpf85nj", "name": "Sang A Park", "photo": "1550445945_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvh2vkpf85nj/1550445945_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvh2vkpf85nj", "is6p6uis14y5ot"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-03T20:57:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Any thoughts on taking CS 106B (Robotics) without the prerequisite 106A?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If there&#39;s a website or syllabus covering 106A someone can share that would be great.
