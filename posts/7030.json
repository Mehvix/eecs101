Reviewing past course notes could also be helpful, but probably the most useful thing for me when taking the course was to go through all the information in the Task Manager (on Windows, at least) and figure out what exactly it means by committed and cached memory, paged pools, processes/threads/handles, logical processers, and so on. You can figure out the basics of most of these things through a simple Google search, but piecing it all together beforehand would probably be a useful few-hour exercise that can prepare you to understand what you&#39;ll be learning in the course. (as a side note,\u00a0comparing all of these specs between laptops in the airport computer store is a great way to get annoyed looks from the store clerks :) ).
