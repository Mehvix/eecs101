EECS leadership, faculty, and staff are doing all that we can to mitigate the impact to students and resolve this situation as quickly as possible.\n\n**Reminder**: You can see the [intended Fall 2022 class schedule here](https://berkeley.app.box.com/v/inprogressfall22). I will continue to update the list as more teaching assignments are confirmed. So, again, if you do not see a class listed, it may simply be that it's not confirmed yet. I CAN say that we do not intend to offer CS 160 or CS 169A during Fall 2022.\n\nI expect (but cannot confirm) that messaging will be sent to students directly once decisions are made. I will do another update here as well so keep checking back throughout the week for updates.\n\nCindy Conners\n\nCompSci Enrollment Manager\" @16669</md>", "created": "2022-04-11T22:47:34Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ksi0nnmoyfi79e"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "l1vb23yq2d9567", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11127": 1, "12511": 2, "13231": 7, "14280": 5, "3156": 6, "3453": 0, "5592": 4, "7687": 3, "7688": 9, "8702": 8}}, "created": "2022-04-11T22:41:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>When will there be an updated list of CS courses in the course catalog?
