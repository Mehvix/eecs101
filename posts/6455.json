Professor Shenker is an amazing lecturer, and I feel that internet architecture and networking is really difficult to learn well on your own time, and is pretty relevant in the software industry. The material covered in DS 100 can definitely be self-studied, and honestly, I feel that students either care too much about titles or overvalue how helpful a DS Minor can be when they are already a CS/EECS major (somewhat redundant). Maybe the DS major helps, but not really the minor if you are already CS/EECS just learn Python and SQL. In addition, you already took CS 186 and CS 189 which DS 100 is supposed to &#34;prepare&#34; you for.
