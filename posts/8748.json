I did everything from filmed comedy skits, to radio shows(we were in a booth reading out a story I think), monologue of smeagol/gollum, 2 person\u00a0in love skit, 2 person breakup skit lol, Tim Burton-like skit, I even made my own 2 hour play.

Being validated during improv and these plays, having that support from someone who excels in the field, made me feel like I am awesome and that I do have great communication skills(or I improved them so much during the class). So if you choose to take on improv, theater, or public speaking clubs, definitely stick with peers or an instructor who is really kind and encouraging.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that being said, there were definitely people in my intro theater class who weren&#39;t feeling it, and that&#39;s okay.
