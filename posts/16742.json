The course is probably most similar to other theoretical CS courses like 174/270 except that it has a heavy emphasis on Networks and Graphs.\n\nThe course does a lightning review of probability which leads into a unit on network structure. This mainly focused on some phase transitions that happen that cause certain structures to appear, like edges, triangles, connected components, etc. We then looked at different kinds of networks from random graphs to preferential attachment. Then we studied different processes on Networks like epidemics, random walks and page rank. It is here that Markov Chains become very important. After this, we are now looking at algorithms on graphs such as min-cut or detecting communities in networks from spectral clustering. \n\nThe course lectures are very mathematical and proofs based. The homework is released every 2 weeks, and it is pretty mathematical stuff, focusing on analysis and proofs. The first 2 homeworks were pretty difficult, but the prof toned them down as the semester went on. This is the first year that Borgs has taught the class and he is basically experimenting with the class with the goal of making it a permanent part of the CS curriculum, so this year was pretty lenient on the grading, not sure how that will change. No midterms or projects, only 1 final. The prof posts handwritten lecture notes online and is pretty good at responding to questions. \n\nOverall, the class is pretty difficult conceptually, and some of the mathematics used is beyond what the average undergraduate in CS will see in an undergraduate course. If you find networks really interesting or if you have a strong math background, then the course shouldn't be a problem.  The prof. does make time to teach any advanced mathematical techniques to the class before he uses them, but you need a pretty mature mathematical foundation to get the most out of the class. I personally enjoyed this course more than CS161, but that is mainly due to my own theoretical interests. CS 161 is probably more useful in industry and easier conceptually, tho the workload of 161 is probably higher. </md>", "created": "2022-04-12T06:55:50Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "l1vsi1j6vif73c", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpdlh77c2cg", "name": "Mridang Sheth", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzlnpdlh77c2cg", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11148": 9, "11246": 4, "11911": 6, "12584": 8, "14717": 2, "14824": 0, "15274": 5, "3551": 1, "6933": 7, "7307": 3}}, "created": "2022-04-09T10:18:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a rising senior interested to take either CS161 or CS194-198 (Networks: Models, Processes &amp; Algorithms) in Fall 22.
