I would probably advice you to take 16A (if it fits your schedule), since it seems you have the prior knowledge to make it a bit easier, but you still have much to gain from the course (plus, otherwise you&#39;ll miss out on the labs, which were my favorite part of the course, and I personally don&#39;t like EE topics!).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, I do understand the difficulty of scheduling, as I have dropped courses simply because of an awkward schedule/outside commitments.
