It is cross-listed as 289A and is generally an advanced upper-division course, expecting students to have significant mathematical maturity. There is no getting around the fact that it is a lot of work. You learn a lot, but you have to work really hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From an industry point of view, there is no doubt that it helps to have a machine learning course under your belt, at least at the very beginning. For students without a large amount of mathematical background, we recommend taking either 126 or 127 before taking 189. Both of these courses are conceptually core to the machine learning area. The probability and facility in working with probability in 126 helps you think and reason in a way that helps. The optimization intuition and problem modeling practice from 127 helps with both thinking and understanding. From a fundamentals perspective, if you have a solid understanding of 126 and 127, you can learn machine learning from books and other resources. The reverse is definitely not true.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In your case, it all depends on your facility with probability and modeling thinking --- how much did Stat 153 hit? You haven&#39;t had EE16AB that hit a bunch of optimization thinking and problem modeling.

I self-studied CS189, Math 110, EE126, and parts of Math 128A. I also took CS294-76 (communication avoiding algorithms)\u00a0and EE127.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of the classes I took, I think EE127 was the most useful as background. Additionally, having taken a paper-reading focused class (294-15) was huge as a fair share of time in industry is spent reading papers. I&#39;d estimate that I spent at least 4-5 hrs a week reading either papers from our reading group or catch-up papers. Additionally, companies like Google also have internal research summits and have some interesting work published internally, some of which are years ahead of the academia papers. The researchers will quietly push out a NIPS/JMLR/other paper every once in a while and then the rest of the world kinda forgets about it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since you&#39;re going into industry with little prior ML experience, you&#39;ll likely be on the engineering side for a bit. I&#39;ve met 2 types of engineers at Google - ML oriented ones who write the code, and performance oriented ones who accelerate it. The difference between a run of the mill piece of ML code and a well optimized one can be &gt;100x. I personally know of an engineer who went into the ML oriented side after undergrad to build her resume and then apply to grad school, so that&#39;s also a perfectly viable track. Some of the leads on different ML efforts are actually former faculty and are really helpful if you ever decide to go back to school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recommendations:</p>\n<p>ML-oriented engineer: 189/127 (I&#39;d recommend 127 since 189 was pretty easily digestible with 16&#43;110&#43;126 knowledge)</p>\n<p>Performance engineer: CS162, CS294-073 (taught by one of the gods of scientific computing at LBNL and a really nice guy),\u00a0CS 294-141 (taught by one of the guys who worked on Halide, which is used for some image processing and ML).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in going even further down onto hardware (i.e. the Tensor Processing Unit and similar efforts), then you&#39;re looking at EECS151, CS164, CS294-141.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just a final note:</p>\n<p>AI/ML is a very broad field. I&#39;ve seen groups working on fairness and interpretability (<a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3052660\" target=\"_blank\">See this paper by MPI</a>), performance in datacenters\u00a0<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04760\" target=\"_blank\">Preprint Paper</a>, theoretical bounds on ML, robotics, etc. Prepare to do a bit of coding, even if you&#39;re not interested, because you&#39;re not senior enough to get out of it (also you kinda have to empirically prove your results on live datasets). A decent amount of the theoretical thrust in industry also seems to be driven by engineering concerns; you&#39;re more often than not looking for the optimal model given strict resource requirements.</p>", "created": "2017-09-14T08:05:13Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "j7k66t3gw541x2", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1l3z09bv2n5", "name": "Nathan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hz4uczhrpbq164", "name": "Woo Sik (Lewis) Kim", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irs7j4l29v91x6", "name": "Neil Lugovoy", "photo": "1548539443_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/irs7j4l29v91x6/1548539443_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1nm9ystr6tv", "name": "Bob Zhou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icu2xhmuxxk2ub", "name": "Pei Yong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "name": "Jason Xie", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0uk9x1lgo7et", "name": "Joyce Luong", "photo": "1503349586_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iy0uk9x1lgo7et/1503349586_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ici5rjmp9on1ym", "name": "Brian Levis", "photo": "1507840593_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ici5rjmp9on1ym/1507840593_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ixj56cq4o911qa": 1, "iy7nq0jv6wu1r3": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "itek8117ve07gl", "name": "Yining Liu", "photo": "1528830792_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/itek8117ve07gl/1528830792_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567784220, "j7s01y165odq5": 1526596257, "jr0d08qbk7i3s6": 1555082786}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ipraxv6jn6h0", "name": "Aditya Jhanwar", "photo": "1568219580_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6ipraxv6jn6h0/1568219580_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhopc26l6a8", "name": "Laiming Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzd1l3z09bv2n5", "hz4uczhrpbq164", "irs7j4l29v91x6", "hzd1nm9ystr6tv", "icu2xhmuxxk2ub", "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "iy0uk9x1lgo7et", "ici5rjmp9on1ym", "itek8117ve07gl", "j6ipraxv6jn6h0", "jktvhopc26l6a8"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-09-13T04:55:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["faculty_advising", "peer_directed", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello, I&#39;m currently a senior trying to see which classes will be the most helpful in industry, as I&#39;m graduating/job hunting pretty soon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A little bit about myself: I&#39;m an applied math major with a stats minor doing my cluster in statistical learning.
