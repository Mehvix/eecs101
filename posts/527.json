Both deal with probability, but in 126, the focus is more on understanding the underlying concepts, the theory, and how they can be used to model situations\u00a0and apply in different settings. By contrast, in 174, the focus is a little bit more on technical tricks and techniques that can be used to analyze randomized algorithms. Overall, 126 is the more &#34;core&#34; supported course in the department. It&#39;s offered every term, etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My personal perspective is that after taking 126 and 170, you should be able to get a lot\u00a0of the value in 174 by reading the truly excellent textbook for 174 and then applying the ideas if you ever need to analyze a randomized algorithm. The reverse is not true. Your conceptual foundation in probability after just 70 isn&#39;t strong enough. After 126, it should definitely be quite strong. With 174 alone, it is possible to still have conceptual/intuition holes if you find yourself just relying on the techniques. Basically, if you have to take just one, take 126. If you have to take one first, take 126 first.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lily Zhang: The only additional information I have for you is that CS 174 focuses on randomized algorithms and using probabilistic processes to analyze algorithms learned in CS170.
