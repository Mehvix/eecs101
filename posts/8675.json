Last semester, we had 3 projects, each of which had two fairly independent parts. Out of these &#34;six&#34; projects, three were basically light homeworks under the name of &#34;project&#34; while the other three were actually involved projects which doesn&#39;t make it any different from 61A&#43;B. It is a tough class for most because it presents entirely new concepts that you might not have even seen in high school (unlike 61A&#43;B) but they do provide A TON of resources at your disposal. My advice would be to join last semester&#39;s Piazza and look at the resources they have in the Google Drive folder. They have literally split every single exam problem by topic so as soon as you learn a new topic (be it C programming or caching), you have a ton of test questions to help you make sure you actually understood the material.
