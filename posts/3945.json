You do not learn any actual tools or services in lecture and they are covered at an extremely high level in section--there is a large amount of self learning and hacking things together to make stuff work &#34;enough&#34; to be a good prototype in this class. The second half of the class drops the lecture format to work with your group in a studio format, where you basically just meet up to get stuff done on your own and maybe ask a TA/GSI for tips/design critiques.</span><div><span style=\"background-color:#fff\">For this reason, y</span>ou will not learn front end development in this class any more than you would for developing your own projects. The case for 160 is just that it&#39;s a project with other people that have different skillsets, and there is usually an application type that is focused on (last semester was smart watches, this semester is alexa/voice). Take the class if you would enjoy working in a diverse group like that, and need some basics in design principles.</div><div>You will still have to self teach android, html/css, etc even if you take this class. If your sole purpose is to learn something like web or android development, I would recommend you just follow along a YouTube tutorial, because that is essentially what you will have to do anyway if you take the class.</div><div><br /></div><div>TLDR; Lectures cover basic design principles, discussion covers tools at a very high level.
