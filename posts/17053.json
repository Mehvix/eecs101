This is a bit more south, and slower velocity than predicted.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Cory Hall is located at latitude 37.87 North and longitude 122.25 west. \u00a0The balloon, as of 3 hours ago was at around lattitude 47 North and longitude 64East. \u00a0Looking at the difference we get 186.25 \u2014 which means that our balloon crossed a major landmark\u2014 passed halfway around the world (similar latitude though), and is now closer to Berkeley from the west than from the east.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I had a question over email, on how we maintain radio contact with our balloon over the Ukraine, or where it is now. The answer is we don\u2019t maintain direct radio contact. We leverage an existing system of receivers that amateurs use to monitor radio waves propagation around the world \u2014 called WSPR. These stations receive our signal and report it to a database that can be probed, downloaded or displayed if you visit <a href=\"http://wsprnet.org/\">wsprnet.org</a>. \u00a0Below is a map of all the stations that received our signal and reported it. What is amazing, is that our signal was picked up not only in Europe, but also in North America and Hawaii\u2014 about 11,500KM away\u2014 remember that our balloon payload is 26 grams, is solar powered and transmits 10milli Watts!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The new predicted path over the next 86 hours is attached as well.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More updates tomorrow.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u2014 Miki</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Ff9b9135d0661903c8c8357f7fb7bd6edcb57165520006c9be3a3ef71a85d997b%2Ftmp.gif\" width=\"498\" height=\"280\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fd96c42e6fc8085c4315a21e750a2469a84755d360241260884b139b8c2fc2752%2FPastedGraphic-1.tiff\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fea2104dba883165d5302e495582d70a2abc92f329dd92275372c10467a9bd805%2FPastedGraphic-2.tiff\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>", "created": "2022-05-05T17:35:41Z", "subject": "EECS Balloons day #15: Major landmark reached -- more than halfway around the world(!)", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l2tahhk5fnd3f5", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 17053, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538247045, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ju7l6u9kuz86", "name": "Milena Mathew", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kshzthi3cka5mh", "name": "Adam Angle", "photo": "1643659602_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kshzthi3cka5mh/1643659602_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ju7l6u9kuz86", "kshzthi3cka5mh"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "enrichment_opportunities", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 326}
