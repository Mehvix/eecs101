For example, if I complete the courses named above with a 3.3 GPA, does it matter if I only scraped by on my math classes? They are on the major application form, but are they taken into consideration at all?\n\nSecondly, if I were to apply and meet whatever requirements it takes to petition, is there still a chance I would be denied on merit? Or would meeting the requirements to petition mean I would surely be accepted?", "created": "2016-01-19T21:37:13Z", "subject": "L&amp;S Prospective CS Major", "uid": "iihwxyg1zv13gp"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ijlx8jjbsx7i8", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 826, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654555940035, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 325}
