Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal. If you see yourself, however, suddenly shift down many seats at once, this could be a bug. Please email ee-scheduling&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu if you suddenly see yourself shift 10&#43; seats at once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>For questions, email at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:ee-scheduling&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu\">ee-scheduling&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu</a>.</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>#pin</b></p>\n</div>", "created": "2019-04-15T16:44:36Z", "subject": "EE/EECS, Fall 19 Enrollment Information", "uid": "jn4sudgnuyx784"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p></p><h1>Fall 2019 EE and EECS enrollment information:</h1>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enrollment Priorities for <a href=\"https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-fall-eleng-16a-001-lec-001\" target=\"_blank\">EE16A</a>\u00a0and<a href=\"https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-fall-eleng-16b-001-lec-001\" target=\"_blank\"> EE16B</a>\u00a0have been updated and are accessible on the classes.berkeley.edu website.

If your lab fills while you\u2019re waitlisted, the only way to switch it is to drop and re-add the class. This will put you at the bottom of the WL, but you cannot be enrolled into a full section.
