Every single ML system used in the world is made up of multiple parts, some DL, some non-DL. Non-deep learning based CV methods are still important in real systems. In addition, insights that we learn from non-deep learning CV can give important insights into why DL models work and vice-versa. \n\nDL is a very new paradigm, and while it has taken over the research world, heavy inertia in industry (don't fix it if it ain't broke) means that there are a lot of classical methods that are still in use. Maybe classical methods go the way of the elliptical integrals (no one does research on this anymore), but so far, classical methods till have relevance today. Heck, if you go a bit beyond normal CV to the world of videos or vision + language tasks, we see a lot more classical methods still present in research.</md>", "created": "2022-01-05T00:50:26Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ky0tqhzlust508", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ioxevb1u8ig68", "name": "Felix Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ioxevb1u8ig68", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "md", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10808": 5, "13796": 3, "13953": 8, "14675": 7, "15393": 2, "15479": 0, "6316": 1, "6912": 9, "7101": 4, "7704": 6}}, "created": "2022-01-04T07:07:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<md>Me (and some of my friends) had this kind of general question about the field of computer vision.
