Adding to what the above comments said, however, I feel like the A would be discounted even if we get all A&#39;s this semester. There is a pandemic going on and instructions are heavily disrupted. Tests are online and with other accommodations, it is overall an &#34;easier&#34; semester if you are fortunate enough to not be affected much in your personal life. Of course, not everyone has that privilege and maybe you are going through hard times and still get A&#39;s.
