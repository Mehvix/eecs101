What are some alternative course options?**\n\nSome related courses are:\n\n\\- ~~EE C128 / ME C134: Feedback control systems. If you haven't taken a similar course before, I highly recommend this. The course also covers a number of frequency-based control design methods that no other course at Berkeley really covers (even at the graduate level).~~ Doesn't look like this is offered upcoming Fall\n\n\\- EECS 149: Embedded Systems. This course is much lower level (closer to hardware) robotics. You'll be learning about microcontrollers and RTOS stuff that we don't cover.\n\n\\- ME 136: Intro to UAVs. This course covers a reasonable amount of the same theoretical material. The labs are quite different, but still very fun and informative.\n\n\\- ~~ME 193B: Feedback Control of Legged Robotics. This course is purely theoretical / software driven, and at a much higher level than 106A (closer to 106B), but the material is very interesting.~~ Also not offered in Fall\n\n**Can I take 106B\u00a0without\u00a0106A?**\n\nIf you're a grad student with some background in robotics, there's a pretty good chance you'll be fine. If you're an undergrad, there's a pretty good chance you'll struggle.
