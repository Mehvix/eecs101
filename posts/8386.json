EE16A has weekly problem sets which take anywhere from 4-10 hours, depending on how well you absorbed the material and on your ability to pattern match(applying the concept in lecture to the questions on the problem set). And cs61c has projects that are no joke and filled with information. I like 61c a lot though because it teaches you basically the intersection of hard ware and software on top of other seemingly random things like parallelism, threads, briefly networking and I/O, with some programming in C. Both manageable though and the circuits in 16a help you seduce why the hardware is a certain way so it helps with connecting the dots.\u00a0</p><p></p>", "created": "2018-12-17T07:40:40Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6lbakwzokh4ky"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Since you&#39;ve already taken math 54, you should have less trouble taking\u00a0 ee16a.
