I have not put much effort into recruiting at my time here and can provide limited insight, so take this with caution. If you have other extracurricular commitments, you&#39;ll need to balance that. If you don&#39;t, then recruiting kind of is your extracurricular so you&#39;re probably chilling. When I took this combo, I was able to log ~55 hours over the semester as an AI for 61A, spend like ~3 hours a week on a sports club, and still goof off a bit on the weekends with friends. After the halfway point in the semester was reached, I would say at least half my weekend I was goofing off. I will admit that my weekdays got pretty brutal sometimes, but I never felt overwhelmed. My prep for this semester was going through the imt decal stuff (great material, highly recommend!) and watching all of the 16A circuits lectures (I took 54 instead of 16A, imo I think this gave me a better lin alg background). I would advise not <em>only</em> prepping for 70, but also for 61b (by doing the projects/labs) and 16B (going through course notes/reader, attempting discussion/csm worksheets). If you prep for all three classes, you will spend the least amount of time in the semester trying to figure out course material and the most amount of time actually doing homework, which should leave you time for doing what you want. Hopefully this gives you an idea of how much time you can spend on things with this type of schedule!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["k1zl10wlpt9gd"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-05-10T07:12:57Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-10T07:17:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ka0q5vx9xj75h5", "subject": "<p>thank you for your input!! really appreciate it!!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2020-05-10T07:17:29Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-10T06:46:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ka0p24eg8q95lq", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Taking all three can work, and work well in my case, dependent on your background, willingness to work at it, and general satisfaction with the material; with 61b hug, it should be doable (imo less work/stress than 61b hilfinger even if you&#39;re a worse test taker). The combo works best if you actually enjoy your classes. I believe if needed to pick 2, take 61b hug and 16b Miki. Not only is 61b and 16b the department recommended combo, hug and miki are also great people in general and taking a class with them will be memorable. I also think taking a class with Rao is an experience everyone should have, as his sense of humor is unmatched by anyone in the department imo and his lectures should also be memorable but brutal lol.
