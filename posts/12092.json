I think CS 182 is a good class, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <em>so</em> necessary for grad applications that you need to take a gap semester and delay a cycle for grad apps (assuming this is what you want to do). Even though there is a lot of hype around neural networks, I think grad schools are looking for your competence in ML more generally (including research, internships, SOP, projects, etc.), and you can definitely take an equivalent class later on in grad school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In fact, most of the assignments in the course are taken from assignments of other available courses (like Stanford&#39;s 231n Assignments 2 &amp; 3, and Berkeley&#39;s CS 294-112 homeworks on Policy Gradients and Q-Learning; the lectures for these courses are also available online), so if you&#39;re worried on missing out on some material compared to others who have taken the course, then you can definitely find them and do them at your own pace (which is what I think the webcasted version of the course is anyway). <a href=\"https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1487769\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This is the link to the course website</a>, if you want to look through it yourself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Again, in the case that it&#39;s not offered I would look at the fall course catalog and pick the classes that most relate to your interests (for example anything out of CS 188/EE 126/EE 127 if you haven&#39;t taken those is probably good, or even CS 194-26 if you are interested in computer vision). Also Info 159 (NLP) is a good course, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s offered in the fall. Since you&#39;ve taken CS 189, you could also look into CS 285 (Deep Reinforcement Learning) or CS C281A (SLT), if you have the other prereqs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the design requirement there isn&#39;t really a good undergrad ML alternative to CS 182, and I&#39;ll leave it to someone else to recommend a solution for that. But ultimately I don&#39;t think the absence of one specific ML class will affect your grad school applications, and it&#39;s definitely not worth two years of your life (by delaying your graduation and grad school apps) to do it.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-04-29T19:05:23Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/26 - 5/2", "bucket_order": 19, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-30T03:33:36Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k9m7rg7jmxd5hn", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>A gap semester is not worth for 182.
