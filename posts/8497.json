If you want to go to industry, you are pretty much set for most non-research positions; just do some personal projects and you should be good. If you want to focus on social science applications, look for professors that do research in the applied areas you are interested in, and ask if they need statistical/data science help, which you can provide. \n\nIf you want to go to grad school, specifically in statistics, analysis is almost a prerequisite for getting in anywhere.
