The classes you will be taking the first couple of semesters will likely be classes that don&#39;t pertain much to anything for graduate school and will be focused mostly on setting you up with a solid CS foundation while &#34;weeding out&#34; students per the GPA cutoff. Basically what I&#39;m saying is don&#39;t think so much about graduate school programs while you still haven&#39;t guaranteed that you will be a CS major.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that said, it&#39;s always good to\u00a0do what you&#39;re doing and plan ahead for your future. I know there are talks of implementing a Data Science major, which I would guess would be your &#34;backup&#34; major if you can&#39;t make the CS GPA cutoff. Since the major has not yet officially been introduced, the prereqs are not set, but I&#39;m fairly certain Data 8 will be one of them. I don&#39;t know the status of that class in terms of enrollment capacity but if it&#39;s filled up for this semester I&#39;d recommend you take that either in the Spring or next Fall.\u00a0Regardless of whether or not it is a prereq for Data Science, and regardless of whether or not you end up declaring CS, it&#39;s probably a good class to have if your goal is to study data science as a subject while you&#39;re here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hopefully that helped. TL;DR, pay attention to any announcements regarding the Data Science major as either a potential fallback (or even double major), take your next four years one semester at a time, and enjoy the ride.
