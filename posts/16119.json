I am doubling in CS and DS rn and honestly, the overlap can be very small if you want it to. Just because they both use computers doesn&#39;t mean they are similar. It is like saying soccer and basketball are similar because they both involve balls. If you are interested in DS you would very likely to take courses that focus on a wide range of mathematic topics like stats and probability, calculus, linear algebra and optimization, and many others that I am too scared to take. In contrast for CS you barely need any math, and you would spend a lot of time understanding design choices ranging from data structures and algorithms to databases and network protocols, and you would dive a lot deeper into the lower stacks of computers (61c already takes you a long way down), and DS you don&#39;t really need to know how the code runs and can survive most courses knowing the bare minimum of python.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The only problem I see is that if your goal is to find a job rather than grad school the double major probably won&#39;t help you very much. For one thing, data science is such a new major that many companies don&#39;t have that listed as one of the majors. Also, the two majors lead toward two quite different career paths, so it is more of a way of keeping more options open than making you more competitive for either position. I am not planning for grad school so I don&#39;t know how much the double major would benefit, but at least I think keeping options open for grad school is more important as that&#39;s a greater commitment than finding a job.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jygyydummf54kx", "name": "Abel Feleke", "photo": "1616536926_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jygyydummf54kx/1616536926_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgcjtoby4zk", "name": "Anita Shen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jygyydummf54kx", "jktvgcjtoby4zk"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-11-23T09:14:37Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-11-23T20:10:05Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kwcj86fkjy63ox", "subject": "<p>Probably SWE, and I intend to work in industry after undergrad then go back and get a masters degree, most likely an MBA\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-11-23T20:10:05Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-11-23T21:20:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kwclqfgpxsd5gw", "subject": "I don\u2019t have a ton of experience but I\u2019m considering to double with DS too mainly because of how few classes it adds for me after classes I already intended to take but in that case I don\u2019t think it adds a lot of benefit for what you\u2019d be doing.
