I think that one of the worst things you can do as an undergrad researcher is to get stuck and not ask people questions - I&#39;ve been at this stage before, and you would find that nothing really ends up getting done, you and your grad student are unsatisfied with the quality of work you do, etc. But conversely, the best undergrad researchers have enthusiasm and are eager to learn more - I think it&#39;s actually not so much about what you know now, as opposed to how much and how fast you&#39;re willing to learn. Mostly everyone will need to learn some new information/tools for their research, so don&#39;t feel bad about not knowing things right off the bat (for your specific case, if you&#39;re in applied ML, you can probably pick things up reasonably quickly, and 16a/b should be adequate preparation if you don&#39;t need too much extra math for your work). So the main thing is that if your grad student wants you to do good work, and if asking a ton of questions will help you get engaged with the research and do your best work, then go ahead\u00a0- overcome the psychological blocks and ask! If they kick you out because of this (highly unlikely) then find yourself a group that actually wants to help you grow as a researcher :)</p>", "created": "2019-06-27T20:02:38Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jxf3gzckwbg443", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irv3b2d6nc5v7", "name": "Sathvik Nair", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "irv3b2d6nc5v7"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 6/23 - 6/29", "bucket_order": 39, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-06-28T10:42:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jxfywbvljpk437", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Just to add on, please ask your grad student all the questions you get!
