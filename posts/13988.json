This is not an entry-level upper-division course like 126 (probability) and 127 (optimization). Entry-level upper-division courses (sometimes referred to as &#34;junior-level&#34; courses) expect that students might not have yet completely mastered the relevant lower-division material, and so do a bit of review and take care to solidify the basics as they build forward.

This could be courses in statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, in dynamics and control, or in a host of other subjects. There are lots of ways to learn the basics. For many graduate students at Berkeley, taking EECS 227A (which is cross listed with 127 the same way that 189 is cross listed with 289A) is really excellent preparation for taking this course, because the broader scope of optimization makes is easier for most grad students from diverse areas to connect to the foundations that we build upon here. If you&#39;re finding the basic linear algebra and modeling in HW0 to be challenging, graduate students are strongly encouraged to take 227A --- either instead of this course, or in addition.
