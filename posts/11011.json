If you did poorly in these classes I would recommend taking 126/127 first and focus on understanding the material in these classes.</p><p><br /></p><p>I agree with above. Adding to it, Focus on understanding the publicly available notes for 189 and more importantly, do DISCUSSION (warm up \u2014 still hard) and THEN homework problems (hard as fuck). Doing problems is the only way to know if you understood the material. But don\u2019t think the homework is doable. You will struggle and probably need to look at solutions or do a lot of googling along the way.</p><p>Based on my experience, the Most important topics to make sure you do practice problems on (bc you\u2019ll fare much better if you clear these hurdles \u2014 again based on my experience):</p><p>1. Linear algebra. Get an intuitive understanding of what each subtopic of linear algebra is about (16A material). It\u2019s not trivial to solve problems in linear algebra if math isn\u2019t your forte (it\u2019s not my forte). The earlier you start trying to solve these hard problem, the sooner you will understand what methods will work for you. For example, I made a cheat sheet with a bunch of LA tools/identities like fun facts about LA. For example how the trace of a matrix and its eigenvalues compare.\u00a0</p><p>2. Multivariate Gaussian distributions is a big topic that takes time to internalize. Say goodbye to single random variables and say hello to vectors of random variables. 189 is a huge jump from 70 in terms of probability knowledge requires. And they don\u2019t teach it really so you\u2019re on your own or get a friend/tutor. For example I had to learn what in the world does it mean to take the expectation of a vector of random variables. No one told me you take the expectation of each element individually and then put the result of that into a vector form as well. I had to ask (once I understood that this was my question)</p><p>3. Use google. The notes are not immediately understandable. For example the notes on MLE never tell you clearly what in the world MLE is. I had to google it to get an explanation in English before the notes made any sense.</p><p>4. If u wanna take a pre-warm up step coz the discussion of hw is understandably way tooo hard, Try to look for topics that both 189/126 or 189/127 cover and then do those 126 or 127 discussions.</p><p>5. If you don\u2019t see much progress in understanding the material (coz it really is hard) don\u2019t give up. Try to just use your time to get the big picture of every note/topic during break. Once you understand the big picture, learning the material during the semester will become so much more enjoyable</p><p></p>", "created": "2019-12-25T08:25:34Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Rather than reviewing the these prerequesites in their entireity, it would be more productive to study ahead in 189 and review the particular topics that come up.
