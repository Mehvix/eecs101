CS70 and 61B have interviews where teaching effectivenss is an important aspect. CSM will (probably) give you more hands on teaching experience. Being a reader typically means that you do some form of grading for 70 and HW Party, OH, etc. This is sort of indirect teaching experience, but certainly valuable for being a TA nonetheless. I don&#39;t think 61B has readers, only tutors, who do the same thing as CSM Mentors and some more things.
