However, I want to take an upper div, probably 170, next semester and push 61c to next year. Since it is not guaranteed that I\u2019ll be able to get into an upper div from the waitlist, though, I thought about adding 61c in phase 2 just in case. I was wondering if that would be safe as I don\u2019t want to end up with just 16b in the end. I have to phase 1 another class as well, so can\u2019t add both 61c and upper div in phase 1 along with 16b. \n\nAlso, how likely would I be to get into 170, or another upper div if I have a better chance, from the waitlist if I phase 1?
