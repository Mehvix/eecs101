I feel really confused about which 4 classes I want to choose. This is my second to last semester at Berkeley. It looks like 184 and 267 are only offered in spring. I don&#39;t know if 168 is gonna be offered in fall and I think it is really useful because I am a backend/ database person. I heard 168&#39;s workload is relatively light compared to other classes. 267 is a class I want to take for my data science applied Math track. 184 looks really fun to me because I do arts and it looks like the only cs class where I can learn arts in 3d. 189 has a really good professor this semester. human happiness (philosophy) is one of the two breadths I have left and I am hoping it to bring me some fresh air...any advice is appreciated....thanks in advance!</p>", "created": "2020-01-24T07:02:36Z", "subject": "168/184/189/267/human happiness (psych 162)", "uid": "j6u7ogb4r4g7n5"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k5rtilap5sz418", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11301, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544669588, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["other", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 384}
