It&#39;s necessary that I finish these three techs this coming semester so I can potentially graduate on time (For context, am a junior  so probably you understand where am coming from. It&#39;s a long story). Anyway, my question is directed to people who&#39;ve taken classes with conflicting schedules before, and how they did it. I was thinking of maybe attending all Math 53 lectures, and basically just watch the 61C webcasts. However, past experience dictates that class attendance (in my own experience) is incredibly necessary to do well so in this regard, I feel more conflicted than ever (Summer classes are not an option for me since I plan on doing an internship this coming summer). Do you think it&#39;s possible to self-study for Math 53 and still do well in the class? I understand that CS170 and CS61C are going to be really challenging, and time intensive but I believe everyone in EECS/CS has had at least one semester where they&#39;ve had to fit in a higher course load than usual in a semester (For me, this might just be it). What are your opinions on this before I proceed to jump into the incoming storm?\n\nThank you!", "created": "2018-12-28T02:16:26Z", "subject": "CS 170 &#43; CS 61C &#43; Math 53 and a 3 unit breadth (Professional Communication)", "uid": "is6p9qkip6cyv"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jq7eonkxns85jc", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8475, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547740943, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 351}
