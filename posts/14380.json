If you&#39;re doing well academically, then you&#39;re already on track for a great time at Berkeley. Yes, <em>some </em>freshmen have <em>some</em>\u00a0appealing experiences. But that&#39;s largely a function of the opportunities given to them in high school. You have more than enough time to catch up, but even when you do, remember that there is always someone who will outperform you with their technical experiences/ability. What will distinguish you are your strengths and quirks later on. You have to find what you like intrinsically and carve out your own path. Some of that may overlap with what everyone else is doing - but don&#39;t chase something just because other people want it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Outside of internships, here&#39;s some specific advice to act on:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Side Projects</strong> - these are great for learning tools/technologies that aren&#39;t taught in school (React, NodeJS, etc.), but are useful later on if you go down the SWE path.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Algorithm Skills</strong> - data structures and algorithms knowledge (starting with 61B and going onwards) are pillars of anything CS-related you&#39;ll want to do later. Especially for interviews later down the line. Codeforces, CS170, and Cormen&#39;s Algorithms textbook are good places to start.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0<strong>REUs\u00a0</strong>- there are summer research experiences (beyond Berkeley) that you can apply for. Some even pay. Quite a few don&#39;t require experience and you should do some research on this. Might be a little late, but I&#39;d still try.</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0<strong>Networking\u00a0</strong>- by which I mean reaching out on LinkedIn for coffee chats and asking successful juniors/seniors for good advice. Networking serves two purposes. The first is selfish - people can refer you later on. The second is for your mental health. I think you&#39;ll find there are plenty of alumni who either got a late start or took a completely unorthodox path to get to a fantastic place currently.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2021-01-31T04:30:19Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kkknbhhra9u36r", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1603740009}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdzjqzylq2a5gx", "name": "Roshan Regula", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbtn7ezlne127x", "name": "Francis Geng", "photo": "1599171884_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kbtn7ezlne127x/1599171884_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c150og21756", "name": "Joel Jaison", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kiqb8k2lutw23w": 1620777469}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bffcvhw93tq", "name": "Masha Bondarenko", "photo": "1633984604_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ke2bffcvhw93tq/1633984604_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "name": "Owen Bai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvh8i561k5t7", "name": "Warren Alphonso", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdz51vmb3hzbu", "name": "Manas Trivedi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kq39q2qr5bo7hj", "name": "Jiacheng Dang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["kdzjqzylq2a5gx", "kbtn7ezlne127x", "ke2c150og21756", "ke2bffcvhw93tq", "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "jktvh8i561k5t7", "kdz51vmb3hzbu", "kq39q2qr5bo7hj"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/31 - 2/6", "bucket_order": 55, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-31T04:33:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kkknf8ch8xwdk", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<md>@Anon Calc - Not OP but thank you for this.

Like what Anon calc said, it is very good that you are doing well academically, as ultimately class is where you learn a lot of the knowledge needed to become a software engineer (or whatever technical field you are interested in pursuing). To break into the industry, I think most important is to have solid algorithm skills (for interviews), and to also do various side projects (could be full-stack, ML/AI) where you really show that you can build a full-fledged product from start to finish. FWIW, my freshman year I was in 0 clubs, and did not have an internship. Now as a sophomore, I received multiple unicorn/FAANG intern offers, and got to onsite interviews at quant trading and other big tech companies. Ultimately I think that as long as you are doing well in class and put in the effort during recruiting season, you should be good :)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2021-01-31T07:37:28Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/31 - 2/6", "bucket_order": 55, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-31T22:47:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kklqi78g7gm5up", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>As an international student, you have to put everything into whatever you are going to do in your freshman summer.

If you are solving leetcode, do 100&#43; problems in the medium and hard range and attend weekly contests. Truth be told, I&#39;ve rarely seen international students land internships/full-time offers in the United States. They either get accepted into top-notch companies (faang, salesforce, snowflake, quants, etc..) or they get nothing and are forced to go back to their own country. Not to scare you, but you can&#39;t be looking at your American peers, doing as much leetcode &#43; classwork as them, and expect to land the same job &amp; opportunities. Even in faang, standards are much higher for internationals. Make sure you always strive for the best in what you do and build a resume/skillset where no sane company/grad school can reject you. Don&#39;t worry about clubs, they can be a waste of time. A social club like AFX and personal projects will give you about the same opportunities and experiences clubs like codeology, codebase can give you. I hope someone told me this when I was a freshman and I hope this helps you achieve your goals in the US!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, to land an internship your sophomore year, have a few great projects, a good gpa, and be able to solve leetcode mediums reliably in (Graphs/Search, Dynamic Programming, Array/Strings, Hashing/Trees, Divide and Conquer) from most to least important.
