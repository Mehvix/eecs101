This has stochastic processes and probability, and is the\u00a0more fully supported course by the department. Once you know the material in 126, you can learn the other material on your own to get by if you can&#39;t take the courses. If you want to understand probabilistic algorithms better, then taking 174 after 126 can be helpful. This is not to say that 126 should be your last Prob/Stat course if you are going on to grad school in any related area. Most grad students at Berkeley in these areas take *multiple* grad-level courses that build further, but 126 &#43; self-study is always an adequate prereq for starting those grad courses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The key takeaway is that when it comes to probability related material, the default recommendation is 126, with 70 being the bare minimum in the requirements.

First, the content perspective: most of the material covered in Stat 150 is covered in EECS126, and done in more theoretical depth (the material not covered: Martingales, Brownian motion, Queuing theory). However, my understanding is that STAT 150 does not cover this material in theoretical depth at all anyhow. Further, EECS126 is able to assume the rigor (in both theory and content) that is presented in CS70, something sorely lacking in STAT134 - hence, the material can be explored from many aspects (for instance, when talking about continuous time Markov chains, a lot more familiarity can be assumed with discrete time MCs in EECS126 than can be done in STAT150). This lets the course delve more into nuances, which are very ably supported by the extensive support modules created by staff over the years (in the form of very well done iPython notebook labs, as well as homework assignments). Now, after finishing EECS126, if you want to explore probability further, you can follow it up with EE226A, which then goes on to build on and cover things like Martingales. Finally, having taken upper division courses in both the EECS and STAT department, I have a personal favorable bias due to personal experience towards the EECS community: I feel like given two courses with the same scope and material, the EECS community has developed a much more friendly and helpful attitude amongst its student-TAs and course staff, something that is much less\u00a0prominent\u00a0within Stat (Take this last line with a grain of salt, as it is a personal opinion based on very few data points).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can not comment on CS174 as I have not taken it, but\u00a0my understanding is that this is more of a CS theory-inclined course (much more emphasis on topics which fell under &#39;Discrete Math&#39; in CS70), and the focus on probability theory is not much.</p>", "created": "2018-06-12T22:17:44Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p9d0f5p6m3"}], "id": "jic8z08hcww3k6", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhopc26l6a8", "name": "Laiming Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvhopc26l6a8"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-12T17:06:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I know that usually after 70 it has been recommended to take either CS 174 or EECS 126 to strengthen probability.
