I took it over the summer with another class, and it was definitely a lot of work. If I had just taken it by itself, it would have probably been a a lot more manageable, but still a lot of work. I did it so that I could focus on just that class and make sure I could get a good grade to declare, and it worked. I don&#39;t think it was any easier than what the semester offering would be in terms of topics because we covered all the topics that semester covers, and if anything it was more difficult because there was a new topic/lecture every single day and you had basically one night to lock in the information from that day&#39;s class. And\u00a0we had new material to cover the same day of a midterm, and also go to discussion, etc. so it&#39;s definitely lots of work in a small amount of time. But if that&#39;s the only thing you have to d over the summer, it&#39;s not so bad. I would say take it over the summer if you want to take it on its own and just focus on getting a good grade without distractions. If you plan to take another heavy class with it, it won&#39;t be much different from taking it over the semester with three other classes, and you may as well spare yourself from getting burned out with work over the summer. Or, if you just want something intensive to do over the summer because other plans were cancelled or not made, it could be a good idea. I personally didn&#39;t like many of the topics from the class so I&#39;m glad I just got it over with in 8 weeks, but those 8 weeks were a real pain tbh.</p>", "created": "2020-04-14T17:39:47Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k906y0m4wto5kt", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-14T16:35:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "enrollments", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Hi!\u00a0<div>I was just wondering if it makes sense to take CS 70 over the summer or not.
