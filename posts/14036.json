Since you have already taken math54, it should be quite easy to pick up the time-domain analysis of RC and RLC circuits. For the frequency-domain part, you just need to make sure you understand phasors, impedance, and Bode plots. They are all small topics and shouldn&#39;t take too long to learn. 16B is almost a control class now, so there isn&#39;t too much to absorb if you want to take 105.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>105 spends the first week reviewing the topics I mentioned above, but the professor does assume you know most of the stuff. Honestly, it&#39;s probably better to not have gone through 16B since it doesn&#39;t do any justice to circuit design.
