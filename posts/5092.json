I&#39;d like to pursue a minor in EECS due to this, but it looks like the only thing in the way is the 16A/16B requirement. I&#39;ve taken Math 54/110 for linear algebra, and will be taking EECS 127 and Stat 153 for optimization/prediction &#34;maturity.&#34; I think I have decent enough mathematical maturity that I don&#39;t have to take EE 16A/B (enrollment in these classes would also be very difficult as a senior).
