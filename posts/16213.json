It wore-up around 5:30am pacific time, over the Atlantic Ocean just north of Bermuda. From there it kept traveling south-east. \u00a0Since it is over the ocean, the VHF radio, which transmits APRS packets is not effective. But fortunately, the short-wave radio is able to report its approximate position (hence the zig-zag trajectory).\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Interestingly, the VHF radio transmits at 1W with packets that are about 1 second long. This results in an energy of about 1 Joules per packet.</div>\n<div>The HF, or short wave radio transmits at 0.01W, with packets that are ~100 seconds long. This results in an energy of about 1 Joules per packet as well!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The main differences between these two are the frequency band, and the amount of bits per packet.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><u><b>Energy \u00a0/ bit:\u00a0</b></u></div>\n<div>An APRS packet will have approximately 2000 bits, while a WSPR packet will be transmitting only 50 bits!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>This means that for APRS, the energy per bit is 0.0005 J/bit, while the energy per bit for WSPR is two orders of magnitude larger at 0.02 J/bit! So while WSPR transmits at a much lower power, the energy packed in each bit is <b>not insignificant.</b> This makes it possible to \u201cdig\u201d WSPR bits out of the noise.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b><u>Propagation:</u></b></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The propagation of waves varies significantly with frequency. APRS frequency is about 144.39MHz (differs slightly between countries), which corresponds to about 2m wave-length. At these frequencies, the propagation is mainly \u2014 line of sight\u2014 similar to light. A balloon at 25,000 feet will see about 100 miles or so.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>However, the HF radio on our tracker is transmitting at about 14MHz, and has a wavelength of 20m. At these frequencies, the F-layer of the ionosphere, which is around 200km high, \u00a0will refract (bend) the radio waves back to earth. The F-layer \u00a0is comprised mostly by light atoms and is ionized by the sun. The integration of these ions and radio waves at these frequencies is the cause for the refraction. This phenomenon is very similar to what light exhibits when transitioning between different materials with different index of refraction. \u00a0So, 14MHz signals can have a hop of about 1000km. They can then be reflected by the ground, or salty water, and have several more hops \u2014 thus traveling to very long distances.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Below are predictions for the next 84 hours, and also a map of stations receiving our WSPR signal.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Let\u2019s hope the balloon survives to see another day. In that case\u2026 more tomorrow.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u2014 Miki</div>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fd6214dee0e013dd89df7dde4d30ee6f3bbf8e9379c673bdd9f54e3b6b0ac4e39%2F113257_trj001.gif\" width=\"960\" height=\"1195\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fdb3c9c1853d6d21ec296c4b04063ec9c3aba158a3fdab3e45dd993189d077971%2FPastedGraphic-5.tiff\" width=\"736\" height=\"459\" alt=\"\" /></p>", "created": "2021-12-14T23:25:29Z", "subject": "EECS Balloon update -- Day 4-- The Bermuda Triangle", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kx6qgcsgbgi3uv", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 16213, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539162821, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c0vhcq3h6wo", "name": "Nathan Fuentes", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke2c0vhcq3h6wo"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "instructor-note", "other"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 376}
