I&#39;d say that 170 problem sets can take from around 8-12 hours a week, maybe a bit less if you are able to go to HW party or OH to get help on the harder problems every week. I mostly learned from the textbook, and didn&#39;t really go to discussion, so maybe tack on an extra ~3 hours for that. Most of the work is the problem sets though - there&#39;s no coding except for the project at the end of the semester. For EE16A, I didn&#39;t have to go to discussion or lab, but I had to spend maybe 1.5 hours a week catching up on lecture/notes, and like 5 hours a week on the HW. I&#39;d expect like 10 hours a week for 16A if you include discussion for participation and the labs, which would be more hands on than just problem sets. So that&#39;d be a total of like ~25 hours total for both.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-12-19T21:09:07Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/15 - 12/21", "bucket_order": 14, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-12-19T21:21:28Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k4d8cfqys1w6ky", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I took both this semester and my honest advice is to honestly just stay on top of it and don&#39;t fall behind.
