I am rising 4th-year transfer student who got admitted to Berkeley and declared as applied math in the fall 2018 semester. However, I am\u00a0really not feeling passionate about the major, because it&#39;s\u00a0more theoretical than I expected. I&#39;m grateful that there are driven mathematicians\u00a0expanding the fields of pure and applied math; however, I can&#39;t see myself as part of that effort. I honestly feel miserable taking those classes. I took Intro to C&#43;&#43; and Data Structures at my community college along Math 128A at Berkeley, and I really enjoyed the programming (I earned As in both the community college classes). I did the unit calculations, and I will still be able to attempt to major in CS (and finish the program) without exceeding L&amp;S&#39; 132-unit ceiling at the cost that my graduation transfers from spring 2020 to spring 2021; if I don&#39;t achieve the 3.2, I simply switch back to applied math and finish at the same time I would have finished the CS program. Has any transfer (preferably applied math major) student decided to switch their major to CS their 3rd term at Berkeley? My main concern is getting into CS61A, EE16A for fall, CS61B and EE16B for spring, and CS70 in the summer term without priority registration as a declared math major; I don&#39;t even know if I can go from &#34;applied math&#34; to &#34;undeclared&#34; and get the priority registration in the meantime. I have an appointment with an advisor this Tuesday, but I want to see if any of you have had similar experiences and are willing to share, so I am informed ahead of the appointment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-07-07T01:49:43Z", "subject": "Rising 4th-year applied math transfer student switching to CS-intended: The Process", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jxsatzu3xhw6m4", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9822, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546264884, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "enrollments", "other", "peer_directed", "policy", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 422}
