You either need to network the hell out of something or develop a specialization that makes you standout. To give my quick experience, I got my first internship after freshman year by converting a URAP position into full time, my second one was due to networking, by my third internship I had developed a specialization and refined it there, fourth internship which I just finished I got hired for my specialization. Not going to say this is ubiquitous across people and I&#39;m sure people are going to comment on how they got aninternship from applying online.
