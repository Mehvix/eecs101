I am a rising senior who has been working as a 20hr TA for quite a few semesters now in addition to working at a research lab in BAIR and taking 16-19 units/2 techs a semester. You mostly need to have good time management skills - procrastinating isn&#39;t going to work too well when you have about as much work as time. You also need to be good at recognizing when you start to feel overwhelmed and communicating these things with your research advisor/course staff team. Trust me, they will understand and work with you to help you out. I also don&#39;t consider myself exceptionally smart but that honestly doesn&#39;t help too much for most of these things. Working hard will get you most of the way there.
