You only have weekly hw that\u2019s ~10 questions due every Friday (I have Zettl so the format of the class might vary for diff profs). Depending on how familiar you are with physics the most challenging part of the class will be understanding the concepts since the actual assignment aren\u2019t that heavy. That being said, the exams are usually pretty different from the homework and the averages for the midterm we just had was around 63% so you would most likely find yourself putting more time into studying than the actual assignment part of the class. Overall, the difficulty of this class comes from exams and concepts (however I didn\u2019t take AP physics in high school so I\u2019m also just less familiar with the content, other people in the class who have some exposure to the topics are not having as hard a time learning the material), while the workload is pretty light. For Zettl, your grade is broken down into HW, 5 quizzes, exams, and labs. As long as you do well in hw/quizzes/labs (which are all easy to get 90%&#43; in), and study for the tests the class should be fine for you\u00a0", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2018-04-13T16:44:56Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-13T01:41:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello, going to be a sophomore EECS major and was wondering what classes to take along with CS61C and CS170.
