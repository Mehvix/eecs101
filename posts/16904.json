Both teach linear algebra in a different manner. And things like SVD, pseudoinverse, PCA, least squares, linear programs, controllability, etc. isn&#39;t really taught in Math 110, whereas EECS 127 blazes past them in the first half of the course (b/c it assumes you already know it from EECS 16B).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But also, this is definitely only one side of Math 110, and it can have many benefits depending on what else you end up doing. Like I definitely think 110 helps give a more solid grasp on fundamental linear algebra topics, but it&#39;s also presented in a much more classical &#39;mathy&#39; sense than the EECS series, and I personally haven&#39;t used it that much as a CS major. Whereas, the controls and optimization side of EECS is something I find more applicable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Source: I took EECS 16A/Math 110/EECS 127, did well on the first two, but poor on 127. Now that I have taken 16B though, it definitely makes 127 seem 10x easier since I don&#39;t have to catch up on the initial linear algebra part.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2022-04-23T19:58:06Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10664": 2, "12094": 1, "16001": 4, "16671": 0, "3810": 8, "5293": 7, "6322": 6, "6902": 5, "7333": 9, "7646": 3}}, "created": "2022-04-23T18:48:30Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I finished my lower divs in my first year (I am graduating) and have not taken any math related classes since -- something I regret.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll be working somewhere where a strong math background, particularly regarding linalg and probability, will be useful.
