By no means is any class a prerequisite for working in SWE at any company. What they will be looking for is whether you&#39;ll be able to do the work. In order to get interviews, previous related experience helps - previous internships are ideal, but cool personal projects, hackathon projects or similar will do as well. To prep for interviews, I&#39;d recommend grinding out a couple of Leetcode problems. Aim to be comfortable with the Medium difficulty problems, that&#39;s about the level of questions you&#39;ll be asked. Sometimes, you might even get the exact questions you practiced on Leetcode!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, I would recommend getting started recruiting asap - since there is nothing CS61B will teach your about interviews that you cannot learn on your own and companies usually have rolling interviews, so recruiting later will mean you&#39;ll compete for fewer spots. Also, consider that you can put 61B on your resume at the start of the semester and just apply - once you&#39;ll be interviewing, it&#39;ll be October or November and you&#39;ll know most of the class anyway.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regarding big companies vs startups/small companies, there&#39;s three considerations. FAANG and big unicorns will give you a name-brand on your resume that will allow you to get your foot in the door pretty much anywhere as a SWE. While you won&#39;t get that at a startup, big companies are also pretty competitive for internships, which is not necessarily the case at startups. Moreover, it&#39;s much easier to network your way into smaller companies. Finally, startups and small companies will be much more hands-on. As an example, during my current internship at a Series B startup, I&#39;m writing production code every day that has serious impact on our business. By contrast, Google, for example, has more than 40,000 engineers, so you&#39;ll be much less likely to have significant impact.</p>", "created": "2019-08-05T19:39:38Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>61B can be split into three parts: learning Java, data structures (trees, heaps, etc), and algorithms (graphs, sorting, etc).
