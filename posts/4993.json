Here at Box, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company, and leading our industry to do the same. As part of those efforts, we&#39;ve created the Box Diversity Scholarship to give students from historically underrepresented groups that have a passion for technology a chance at a $20,000 grand prize scholarship (and $4000 runner up scholarships!). We want to ensure that perspectives from every group are included in the future of tech, and we want you to be a part of it too!</p>\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please inform your department students, fellow club members, family, friends (everyone that&#39;s a current undergraduate student!) that applications are now open and due by <strong>Oct 2, 2017</strong>. For more details, please see our <a href=\"http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/\">website</a>. For any questions, please send a note to scholarship&#64;box.com.</p>\n<h1>Student Leadership Opportunities with TGIF</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) is seeking to fill the Undergraduate Student At-Large Representative and Environmental Justice Student At-Large Representative positions on the TGIF Committee.
