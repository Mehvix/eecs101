From this, you can immediately conclude that optimization thinking, probability, and linear algebra are fundamental prerequisites to understanding machine learning. Without them, you will miss the machine learning in a machine learning course, because you&#39;ll get bogged down by\u00a0the other stuff.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, we have:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Core underlying ideas --&gt; problem-solving approaches and algorithms</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In principle, one could try to learn\u00a0purely at the level of problem-solving approaches\u00a0and algorithms. But then, an introductory course on ML would just be one thing after another, with no unity. This would turn into an exercise in memorization. Could you use the approaches in practice? Sure. You could be a useful minion.\u00a0But\u00a0then, when in the future, new approaches and algorithms are discovered, you will have to memorize them afresh. Furthermore, if you ever have to modify or combine approaches, you would be left to ordinary software-engineering tinkering/debugging skills. Because you wouldn&#39;t actually understand what is going on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ideally, a Berkeley student should aim to understand a subject that they are taking. And fortunately, there are *plenty* of online resources that will explain to you the problem-solving approaches and algorithms. You don&#39;t need to take 189 for that. So 189 is trying to help you understand.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was a reason that the lower-division curriculum was transformed by the introduction of the pre-machine-learning courses 16A and 16B. The goal was to make it easier for people to build to a solid understanding. (And for those who just wanted to pick up algorithms and problem-solving approaches to do so on their own. After all, the core ideas of ordinary least squares, matching pursuit, control and the roles of eigenvalues in convergence, the SVD, least-norm solutions, PCA, classification by hyperplanes, and k-means are all already introduced in EE16AB.) But for the vast majority of people, you need more probability to really understand 189. So if you take one course beyond EE16AB, take EECS126.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both EECS126 and 127 will serve you well no matter what part of EECS you end up in. Whereas 189 will mainly help you if you go into an area that leverages machine learning specifically.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>Our colleague Prof. Jordan has recently posted something that students might benefit from for a larger context:\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7</a></p>\n<p>&#34;&#34;&#34;</p>", "created": "2020-12-25T16:04:16Z", "subject": "CS 189 Prerequisites", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kj4gte70rkx2uk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13997, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541606487, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyeobq4n3ao7kw", "name": "Merrick Wang", "photo": "1584281693_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jyeobq4n3ao7kw/1584281693_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1596323170_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1596323170_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhtpbc6ywje1vo", "name": "Ben Hoberman", "photo": "1592267109_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jhtpbc6ywje1vo/1592267109_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jyeobq4n3ao7kw", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "jhtpbc6ywje1vo", "jzqdhqjfxui43k"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "enrollments", "faculty_advising", "lscs", "other", "peer_directed", "policy", "research", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 447}
