I&#39;m also an international student and I apply to roughly ~200-300 internships in my freshman/sophomore year. A lot of the times why we don&#39;t get any coding challenges is because most of the companies don&#39;t want to go through the hassle to sponsor a visa for us, they would rather pick an equally qualified applicant who can just work for them right away. One thing I learnt which helped me get big internship offers is to actually attend networking events/company talks/career fairs. Just sit there listen to them, ask question, and approach to them that you&#39;re interested in this role and try to impress the engineer. A lot of the times, they would give you their contacts and ask you to follow up email with them which bypasses the coding challenges and straight into the interviews. If they ghost you, whatever, you tried. But if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;re on your way. Once you get the interviews (which I think it is the hardest for us), you will still need to do well but it removes the problem of them ghosting/ignoring you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ask your friends for a referral too. These referrals help you bypass coding challenges and resume dumps they do and straight into the interviews. Most importantly, just don&#39;t give up hope. I thought I wouldn&#39;t get an internship after 300&#43; applications last summer too before I finally got one at a startup.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgm6gkay55e", "name": "Brian Kim", "photo": "1581362529_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvgm6gkay55e/1581362529_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvgm6gkay55e"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-11-12T06:31:39Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 11/8 - 11/14", "bucket_order": 10, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-12T18:51:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "khf6ukkl5sl64c", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Sorry to hear that. You seem to have some great experience. As a fellow international student, I can empathise with your situation. As a previous answer noted, referrals help with at least getting an interview. Besides asking friends, what helped me out the most was connecting with folks on LinkedIn and talking to them about their jobs. If the conversation went well, I would ask them for a referral. Try and get in touch with recruiters on LinkedIn as well, since they are the ones who do the first screen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Include keywords from the job description in your resume (you might have to slightly change your resume for every application because of this). Also, make sure your resume is ATS optimised. I haven&#39;t done that personally, but have heard good things about getting more interviews from friends who have.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Besides all that, keep practicing interview questions as much as possible, though it seems like you&#39;re doing well enough on the coding challenges you get. Also, don&#39;t discount startups in your search. We are lucky to study in Berkeley, and have access to a great ecosystem because of this.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a crucial year to get an internship for you, especially as an international student, since it&#39;s arguably harder to recruit for full time roles without a junior year internship/return offer. The good news is that companies also have a second wave of recruitment in the spring, so keep on keeping on and you should get something good!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgm6gkay55e", "name": "Brian Kim", "photo": "1581362529_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvgm6gkay55e/1581362529_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvgm6gkay55e"], "type": "followup", "uid": "j3jn0rk05ds5jm", "updated": "2020-11-12T18:51:18Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 11/8 - 11/14", "bucket_order": 10, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-11-14T15:10:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "khhttqnmajkgr", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Hey,<div>Just a small tip: make sure you are indicating on your applications that you are authorized to work in the US and will require sponsorship in future.
