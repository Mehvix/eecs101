I&#39;m having a bit of trouble deciding my courses for next semester and I basically boiled my choices down to the options above. I know that 170&#39;s enrollment is still closed, but from everyone I&#39;ve asked, there&#39;s a pretty high likelihood it will be offered. In that case, which of the combinations above do you feel is the relatively easiest one to take?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With regards to my personal background to provide a bit of context, I&#39;m currently taking 70 and enjoying both parts of it quite a lot (I just generally love math/stat related stuff) and my highest workload was spring last semester where I took 61B &#43; EE 16B &#43; Math 1B &#43; R&amp;C Writing &#43; 2 unit IMT DeCal. I found the workload quite easy and did pretty well in those classes but I&#39;m not sure how that translates to the workload for the upper div courses since these will be my introductory UDs.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m currently enrolled in 126 and 53 so I will have to phase 2 61c and/or 170 regardless of the combination I end up picking so that might be worth keeping in mind I guess.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another thing is that I would prefer to take 126 with Ramchandran next semester and 61c with Garcia in Fall but I&#39;m willing to give up that preference if a different workload is considered easier.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d really appreciate any help I can get with this.
