I would say CS 189 and CS 186 would be most useful because Data 100 (which I took last semester) is more focused on data science, specific Python packages to perform data analysis, and stats / data analysis-focused projects like Trump tweet sentiment analysis, etc. If you already know how to use Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn you might not learn too much from the class because it doesn&#39;t go very deep into the math behind the ml functions we call. However, 186 and 189 might be too hard together along with a math class while Data 100 is comparatively conceptually and workload-wise light. I personally would recommend 186 and 100 if you&#39;re interested in more swe roles, and 189 and 100 if you&#39;re more ml-focused.</p>", "created": "2018-10-16T02:17:44Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jnb3l4n0vjd4ek", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-16T01:52:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "So I plan to take a math course but I wanna take a couple of these courses, which two of these three would be the best in terms of managebilility and usefulness?<div><br /></div><div>Data 100</div><div>CS 189</div><div>CS186</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks!</div>", "created": "2018-10-16T01:52:50Z", "subject": "Classes", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jnb2p3wtn6d6gq", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7866, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548290985, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["student", "suggestion_box"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 283}
