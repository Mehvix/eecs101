It&#39;s basic circuit theory and engineering mathematical analysis. You don&#39;t EE that would be completely useless to a CS major, like designing a power grid.

However, that&#39;s absolutely not what the class is about.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#39;s a common misconception that 16B and math 54 overlap. The two share nothing aside from a little bit of differential equations. 16A is the &#34;54 equivalent&#34;. Most of the engineering analysis topics in 16B are nontrivially rooted in linear algebra (SVD, PCA, spectral theorem, control/reachability analysis) and are sufficiently novel to be worth a separate class, even for someone who has taken 54.

Sure it&#39;s niche, but I still think this is within the realm of what a CS major should teach you.

I guess the impression that eecs16a/b are EE classes comes from the fact that they were called ee16a/b. However, after taking upper div EE courses, you will quickly realize that 16a/b contain very little EE. For example, there are no devices physics, electrodynamics, photonics, or MEMS in 16a/b, which require students to know physics, chemistry, and math at a level much higher than that of 16a/b. Some EE students are taking ee105 and 120 before taking 16b simply because 16b has become more and more CS-oriented and. Having circuit in a class doesn\u2019t make it a hardcore EE class and not many EE upper divs are about circuit design. Most of the knowledge you learn from 16a/b are things like control and signal processing, which directly connects to CS topics nowadays. Honestly, fields such as control and signal processing are in the intersection of CS, EE, ME, etc, and its very hard to classify whether you are learning CS or EE; therefore, the sentiment that we should not study any EE is kind of shortsighted. Moreover, if you really doesn\u2019t want touch any EE, why do a lot of CS students take EECS126/127/106a/149/225b? These were all ee courses originally, but the majority of the enrollment comes from the CS major. So why should you treat 16a/b differently?

It is still your responsibility to adhere to class attendance policies and check with the professor of the class regarding alternate midterm and final exam dates. Time conflicts are only enabled for lectures, not discussions/labs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Enrollment Tips:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There must be an open seat in all parts of the class and you must meet enrollment priorities, if any, at the time of adding the class to be enrolled. E.g., if the class has lecture &#43; lab &#43; discussion, you have to be able to enroll in all 3 to be officially enrolled.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unit limits: Phase I = 13.5 units, Phase II = 17.5, Adjustment Period = 20.5 These include waitlisted classes.</p>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>\u00a0I am waitlisted and my position went higher on the list, e.g. from 4 to 5. Why did this happen?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0This is most likely due to an enrolled student switching from an open lab/discussion to a lab/discussion that is full. Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal. If you see yourself, however, suddenly shift down many seats at once, this could be a bug. Please email ee-scheduling&#64;eecs.berkeley.edu if you suddenly see yourself shift 10&#43; seats at once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Enrollment drop-in hours will be by appointment only.
