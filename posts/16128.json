I want to drop a class but have used both of my late drops.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I say I have used both of my late drops, I mean that L&amp;S has capped me at 2 late drops.

I would no longer be constrained by L&amp;S drop rules in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) If I do so, how quickly would this &#34;drop&#34; be completed on CalCentral as the deadline (December 3rd) is coming up for late drops?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) Can I &#34;re-declare&#34; L&amp;S CS the following semester? The reason why I ask is because I want to graduate in both CS &amp; Business (simultaneous degree).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Essentially, I want to drop classes but I can&#39;t because I used my L&amp;S late drops. But if I can just be a Business major then the business school allows me to drop my classes.
