A masters\u00a0is usually recommended, but I&#39;ve seen people succeed with a BS. If you want to do it with a BS, I would definitely recommend software engineering classes, since unless you have a PhD (or are very lucky) you&#39;ll be\u00a0designing software/firmware/hardware for robots, rather than doing the higher-level research-y stuff.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regarding 106A/B, a lot of people come into 106A to test the water and get some basic experience with robotics. It&#39;s great for that, and will likely give you enough experience to do software engineering for a robotics company (assuming you&#39;re already qualified as a software engineer). 106B is significantly harder/more time consuming than 106A, as well as being more research-based, so a good portion of students don&#39;t want to take it. That being said, it&#39;s a great experience and we&#39;re looking at ways to improve the pipeline.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also\u00a0a brief\u00a0anecdote\u00a0on struggling in classes: I did pretty badly at school my first two years. Out of 20 or so classes I only got 2-3 A&#39;s or A-&#39;s, and I got some sort of C in half my core courses. But then the next year I got a bit more used to the rigor of Berkeley, and started taking more project classes (like 106A/B). Seeing the applications gave me the intuition I needed to do better in my theory classes too, and I ended up doing well enough my last two years to get into grad school. Don&#39;t give up on your dreams because the first two years are hard.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2019-04-11T19:01:42Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i09a0mpvrV6"}], "id": "jud0e0kqj8z5ok", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8zl3nphb8", "name": "Dominic Carrano", "photo": "1539468621_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p8zl3nphb8/1539468621_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p8zl3nphb8"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-10T01:19:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "I&#39;m thinking of taking 106A/B but I&#39;ve heard you usually need a PhD to be successful in robotics.
