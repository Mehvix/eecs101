That class is much better than 134, and it will be a heavy handed intro into probability. It will probably be hard, but the teaching staff is great, and the textbook is very well thought out. If you put in the effort, you will have a rich understanding of probability (albeit not perfect), and you will breeze through the cs70 probability. There is programming in stat140, but considering youll have taken 61a and b I think youll be in great shape. Its what I wish I did. \n\nI think probability and discrete math gets a bad wrap because 70 is such a cutthroat class, but if you learn the material for the sake of learning it, and not for declaring CS (which sounds sort of corny, but its true), you wont have as much difficulty doing well in the class as most. If you are so inclined, you would be able to transition well into courses like 126, 127 etc relatively early in your college career if you care about that sort of stuff.

The thing is, the course is really split in half; and I made the mistake of only reviewing the first half of the course before it started, so that when the second half came, I was pretty lost and struggled a lot more with the pace.</p>\n<p>For the discrete section: If you don&#39;t have too much time to prepare and haven&#39;t been exposed to mathematical notation before, even just going through the set/mathematical notation and propositional logic notes will help you, since you will need to be very confortable with that notation and will use it throughout the entire course. It&#39;s also covered in like 1-2 lectures so it will be introduced very quickly. The IMT decal covers this stuff at a slower pace in their notes, so consider going through them if you can.</p>\n<p>For the probability section: Somewhat unlike the discrete math portion of the course, the problems you encounter grow in complexity such that you will need to have a solid grounding in previous material in order to understand newer material. I would maybe review the first lectures of this half (I think they are counting/combinatorics, conditional probability, or something like that) and become familiar with the different problem scenarios since they will come up in pretty much every problem you encounter later. This is especially true if you&#39;ve never taken a stats course previously, or it&#39;s been a while since you have. You may need to review it again when the probability section starts, but I think it&#39;s worth seeing it once before the class begins so that the transition isn&#39;t so bad later.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kamobzyyjas6fk", "name": "Ronit Chawla", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kamobzyyjas6fk"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2020-12-08T03:40:22Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11910": 5, "12063": 2, "2140": 9, "4219": 3, "504": 8, "5201": 1, "5498": 6, "6902": 7, "7173": 4, "7387": 0}}, "created": "2020-12-07T23:38:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "other", "lscs", "suggestion_box", "faculty_advising"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Are there any classes that will prepare me for CS 70 except EECS 16A and EECS 16B?</p>\n<p>(I will also be taking CS61A, CS61B, Math 1A, and Math 1B before taking CS 70)</p>", "created": "2020-12-07T23:43:25Z", "subject": "Classes which help prepare for CS 70", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Are there any classes that will prepare me for CS 70 except EECS 16A and EECS 16B?</p>\n<p>(I will also be taking CS61A, CS61B, Math 1A, and Math 1B before taking CS 70)</p>", "created": "2020-12-07T23:38:39Z", "subject": "Classes which help prepare for CS 70", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 2, "i_edits": [], "id": "kif74enjl40pp", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13888, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541727768, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 428}
