So, talking generally and without knowing more about your situation, taking 2 courses during the summer is comparable to taking 4 courses during the semester, and not uncommon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But also note that not all summer courses are run simultaneously. For example, CS courses are during session C (the latter 8 weeks of the 12 weeks of summer courses). So, if that&#39;s your busy course, you can pair it up with a course during session A (the first 6 weeks), and only have 2 weeks of overlap.</p>", "created": "2017-02-19T23:58:12Z", "subject": "", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I try to space them out over sessions.
