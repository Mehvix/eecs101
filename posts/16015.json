It is a very enlightening class, you will really get to learn the basis for CS theory, and prove everything rigorously. With Sinclair, we got one homework a week, which was pretty manageable. And the problems were very good for understanding the material and really getting some experience applying the concepts. \n\nYou mention computability. With Sinclair, I feel like this was the least emphasized part, since 70 actually does a pretty good job discussing it. You learn stuff a formally and come up with classifications for different levels of computability, but the class focuses more on automata and complexity theories. Proving that problems are NP-Complete or not is a pretty good taste of what the complexity part of the course is.", "created": "2021-11-01T00:21:41Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>EE120 with Babak is the best class I&#39;ve ever taken at Cal.
