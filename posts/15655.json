Anecdotally, I had taken formal logic and discrete math at my community college, and I still found that honors math 54 was easier than CS 70.\n* From a prereqs perspective, math 54 is a prerequisite for EECS16B (if you do not wish to take EECS16A). This might matter because people who wait too long to take EECS16B miss out on some foundational content for machine learning, etc., and they apparently have trouble enrolling in the class later on. More generally, linear algebra provides a nice perspective on a number of things, and it might increase your appreciation for one or two concepts in CS 70 if you take it first.</md>", "created": "2021-09-03T04:18:26Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;d say take cs70 first purely from a prereq perspective.
