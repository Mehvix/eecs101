That course is amazing -- read the Walrand supplemental and you will feel one with the heavens. I know that doesn&#39;t make a ton of sense, but consider this. When you were a little kid, you probably knew math rather well [after all, you&#39;re here]. You probably knew various geometric shortcuts, and they were a source of humor and curiosity. These were good things, and you could be clever about them [not unlike how linear algebra has all these beautiful properties itself]. EE 126 can show you that same feeling, for lack of a better description, of a language and interaction with the world in a manner few things, not just courses or textbooks or blah blah blah can, but in a manner few things ever can give you in your lifetime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think if you are brutally honest with yourself, and want to be something completely different than what you are right now [and I don&#39;t mean this sardonically, I am simply asking if you are seeking a deep personal change], take 126.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Likewise 127 is just as hard lmaooooo, if lower divs were hard, upper divs may not be &#39;grade-hard&#39; but conceptually, are mind-shattering.
