They are hard, so don&#39;t be encouraged if you aren&#39;t able to but make an honest attempt to solve every question. Its important that you understand how to solve the problems, so also go through solutions when they are released, and maybe even try to solve the questions that you could not do on your own a week later without any help.\n\nAt the core, to do well in CS70 its essential that you practice what you&#39;ve learned by solving problems; that is how you achieve a certain degree of proficiency in the material that will help you achieve the grade that you want.", "created": "2019-05-26T17:21:30Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "jw57mhtmijo7a4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jpslgn3m4lsk6": 1555223627}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhobhold1yokb", "name": "Kaushik Sankar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "jhobhold1yokb", "is6p6j9n6u55fp"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/26 - 6/1", "bucket_order": 44, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-26T18:10:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jw59czyw3auyo", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "James Hulett was my discussion TA and he\u2019s great", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2019-05-26T18:10:06Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-25T20:53:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "peer_directed", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Any advice/tips on getting at least a B&#43; in CS 70 over the summer with James Hulett?", "created": "2019-05-25T20:53:13Z", "subject": "CS 70 over the summer", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jw3zqx0nh3n5s9", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9679, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546459648, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3jrmnh6ia96x4", "name": "Cindy", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6f6af3okhm", "name": "Karthik Vegesna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "j3jrmnh6ia96x4", "jjs6f6af3okhm"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 409}
