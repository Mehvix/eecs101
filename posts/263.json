Similar to the response given above I had a full-time internship during the day and did the class\u00a0at night (and watched lectures on the train I commuted on). Lectures take about 3-5 hours a week to watch. There are about 4-5 sections (2 assignments worth) of hw due a week, basically something (lecture check understanding Qs, quiz, or hw) is due every day except Friday and Sunday if i remember correctly (whether that&#39;s a hw assignment, a quiz or the concept questions for the\u00a0lectures). Quizzes they gave 2 hours to complete which included the time it took you to get it scanned and uploaded to bcourses. The TAs were really helpful if you reach out to them (I video chatted a few times with one of them when it got close to the final). If you&#39;re taking it proctored be sure to\u00a0give yourself time to find the building at the college you take it at i was almost late. All in all I would recommend the course just plan on giving yourself about 14-20 hours a week on it.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "hktxrk2tkas3go", "updated": "2015-05-09T21:32:21Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-05-06T07:41:20Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Has anyone taken an online course at Berkeley?
