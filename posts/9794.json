From there, you&#39;ll be able to see where exactly you&#39;ll want to focus (i.e. in the signal processing, the circuits, or the biology) and have the requisite knowledge to get involved in substantive research in one of the many biomedical-focused labs on campus. A list of professors working in this area includes Jose Carmena, Michel Maharbiz (I work in this group), Rikky Muller (teaches EE 140 on occasion), Jan Rabaey (used to teach EECS 151), Ana Arias, Miki Lustig (teaches EE 123), Kris Pister (teaches EE 140), and Bernhard Boser (teaches EE 140 and graduate analog classes), as well as other circuits professors that are more peripherally involved (e.g. Elad Alon, Ali Niknejad).
