If you are first on the primary waitlist and both the primary and secondary section that you have enrolled in are available, you will be enrolled in the class, given that you meet all requirements (such as requirements for the class, enrollment phase, have no holds, etc). If there\u2019s no space in the secondary section you have selected, you will be bypassed and the process will continue to the next person until all primary component seats are filled.
