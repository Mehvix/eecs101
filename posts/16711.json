Workload is low-medium (homework or iPython lab every week) and most of the content is fairly straightforward but don\u2019t underestimate the difficulty of the class, the material is not trivial. All the material I\u2019ve learned seems to show up in all sorts of places\u2014phasor domain circuit analysis, machine learning, robotics/control, even in probability theory. Good to take with other techs but don\u2019t try to overload or you won\u2019t have time to learn the material well.\n\n------\n\nHi all, I\u2019m the Head TA for EE 120 this semester, and I wrote this up on this semester\u2019s Piazza as a guide on what to do after EE 120, but I think it is relevant here as well.\n\nSince EE 120 covers both Signals and Systems, there are two different tracks you can take from here depending on your interests. There are also \u201ctangential\u201d connections you can make with all kinds of areas in EECS.\n\n# Signals Track\n\nThe signals track everything to do with Signal Processing.\n\n## Course Work (Undergraduate and Graduate)\n- **EE 122: Introduction to Communication Networks** - This class has not been offered in a while, but it was offered this semester. It focuses on how to use signals to transmit information over a network (e.g how does WiFi work).\n- **EE 123: Discrete Signal Processing** - this is the most direct successor course to the EE 120 Signals Track. You learn all about DSP, which means learning how to design filters and gaining a deeper understanding of signals through the DFT, spectrograms, and wavelet analysis. The class has lots of fantastic labs which introduce you to the practical aspects of DSP, from decoding positioning packets from airplanes to transmitting GIFs over radio.\n- **EECS 225A: Statistical Signal Processing** - In EE120, all of our signals have been deterministic. But what happens if we add random noise to our signal, or our signal itself has random variations (like the stock market)? How does Fourier Theory and Filtering apply in this scenario? This course is heavily theoretical and covers topics such as Wiener filtering, Kalman Filtering, and Hidden Markov Models.\n- **EECS 225B: Digital Image Processing** - \u00a0In EE120, all of our signals have been 1D. But images, which are 2D signals, are an important signal for everyday life. This class covers traditional image processing techniques and has you read papers on modern image processing, which is largely deep-learning focused.\n- **EECS 225D: Audio Signal Processing for Humans and Machines** - This class focuses on two key areas of audio signals: text-to-speech synthesis and automatic speech recognition. In other words, generating speech audio, and converting speech into text. If you are interested in learning how to build systems like Siri and Alexa, then this is the class for you. Increasingly, this field, much like image processing, is going to deep learning, so this class covers both classical and modern techniques.\n- **EECS 225E: Principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging** - MRI is incredibly important to medical imaging. It actually works by taking samples in the Fourier Domain (called k-space) instead of the Space Domain like a camera. This class focuses on MRI specific signal processing.\n\n## Research Areas\nThe research in signal processing has largely tended towards deep learning recently. However, based on the words of a few industry professionals, classical signal processing still has a place in creating good features for machine learning systems. From a few professors in the field, classical signal processing is important for both understanding what deep learning systems are doing, and motivating new deep learning architectures. The biggest area of modern classical signal processing research is in a field called Compressed Sensing. The idea is that we can actually take fewer samples than the Nyquist rate (which we will learn about) allows and still accurately reconstruct the signal if it is sparse in some basis.\n\n# Systems Track\nThe systems track is all about controlling physical systems. It has tight connections to robotics and control theory.\n\n## Courses \u00a0(Undergraduate and Graduate)\n\n- **EECS 106A & B: Introduction to Robotics** This class covers the kinematics, dynamics, and control of robotic manipulators. However, the control content does not overlap very much with EE120, since real robotic systems are typically more complicated than the SISO LTI systems we analyze in this class, and 106A does not use the idea of transforms at all. The mathematics of robotics makes heavy use of the matrix exponential, which is perhaps the most direct connection to 120. There is a heavy lab component and an open-ended final project.\n\n- **EE 128: Feedback Control Systems** - This is the most direct follow-on to EE120 in the systems track. It explores the state space representation and feedback systems we saw in class in much more detail. The class primarily focuses on the Laplace Transform, which we hopefully will see in lecture in the future, and dives deeper into steady-state error, root locus analysis, and more. The labs are also physical which is cool as you can see the systems in action.\n\n- **EE 221A: Linear System theory** - This class is all about linear systems. It covers state space models in even more detail than EE128. It is heavily theoretical.\n\n- **EE 222: Nonlinear Systems - Analysis, Stability, and Control** - In 120, everything we have done is linear because linear systems are easier to understand. However, most things in the real world are nonlinear. Sometimes, you can treat nonlinear systems as linear within a particular operating regime, but when this breaks down or is suboptimal, EE 222 teaches you what you can do.\n\n- **EE C291E: Hybrid Systems and Intelligent Control** - Hybrid systems are not time-invariant, so you can partition time into sections, and within each section the system is time-invariant. Hybrid systems and control deals with how you design and control such systems.\n\n## Research\n- Much of the research in Controls is in Robotics research. Many labs collaborate with the Mechanical Engineering department as well because control is also a topic central to Mechanical Engineering.\n\n# Tangential\nThe classes tangential to EE120 fall into 3 main buckets: courses which build machinery for advanced Signals and Systems work, courses which have connections to EE 120, and courses which you should take if you want to work in areas related to EE 120.\n\n- **EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes** - This is _the_ course to take if you want to get a better handle on probability and probabilistic thinking. It gives you a good overview of how to bring probabilistic concepts into engineering. A few topics in this course are somewhat easier to understand with 120 under your belt, but the biggest connection between EECS 126 and EE 120 is when you start thinking of Random Processes as Signals and try to filter them. That is what EECS 225A covers, but you need this course as background.\n\n- **EECS 127: Optimization Models in Engineering** - Optimization is pretty tangential to EE120 content, but it is a fundamental engineering skill. For example, optimal filter design requires solving optimization problems, and the LQR method in linear control is an optimization problem.\n\n- **EECS 149: Introduction to Embedded Systems** - Signals and Control and just one piece of real-world devices. Most often, these algorithms that we design mathematically are actually implanted on embedded hardware, so if you want to do this work in industry, then learning how to program microcontrollers and work with hardware is a must. EECS 149 bridges the gap between our very mathematical approach to Signals and Systems and the real world.\n\n- **CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems** - This class covers (among other things) the Fast Fourier Transform, a computational efficient algorithm for computing the DFT. The class doesn\u2019t use any ideas about the frequency domain in studying the FFT, instead considering it from the perspective of polynomial multiplication. It is highly tangential to EE 120, but nevertheless still a good class to take if you are interested in CS.\n\n- **CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging**: Graphics is another space which is very tangential to 120, but ideas from sampling theory and signal processing still crop up, so taking EE 120 could give you a deeper understanding.\n\n- \u00a0**CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning** - One of the topics in this course is convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which in fact do not perform convolutions, but rather a related operation called cross-correlation. Nevertheless, CNNs have generated state-of-the-art results on image recognition tasks, and the principle behind them is closely related to LTI systems and the frequency domain, albeit with 2-dimensional signals (images). Machine Learning is also becoming a fundamental skill of every engineer, so it could be helpful to take the class, though it is heavily mathematical.</md>", "created": "2022-04-04T20:30:09Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jirs7vvnlfy5vj"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Babak is probably the best professor at EECS.
