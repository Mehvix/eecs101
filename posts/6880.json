That was my strategy for avoiding people who are prone to procrastination, and it worked out pretty well for me, though I can&#39;t say how much of that was luck. The autograder gives some statistics about other groups and from that I could see that many other groups procrastinated quite a bit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, though, definitely think about whether or not you really want to have a semester where you only take one technical course. Being a Berkeley student is an amazing opportunity and you don&#39;t want to leave feeling like you didn&#39;t take full advantage of it.

If Shenker gives the same amount of work that he did last Fall, you can expect 1 midterm, a final, and three networking-related python programming projects (each of which is probably shorter than most other CS projects you&#39;ve completed by now).

I too joined a group of &#34;randoms&#34; at the beginning of the semester, and I ended up\u00a0with a group\u00a0of students who were on top of everything and didn&#39;t procrastinate. Whether this was luck, or due to searching for a group early on, I&#39;m not sure, but it probably can&#39;t hurt to start searching as early as possible. If you can find a group of students who like to start projects early and who do their fair share of each project, the workload of 162 is actually very manageable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Best of luck with your classes and internship search next semester :)</p>", "created": "2018-05-01T05:42:27Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "jgn8xawtvru5rz", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6nezwwv5jd", "name": "Aryana Shabestari", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iscem14kbsu5vi", "is6p6nezwwv5jd", "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-30T18:07:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m interested in the material, but I&#39;m aware that the workload is demanding and projects are done in groups.
