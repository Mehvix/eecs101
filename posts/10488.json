If you do still wanna pass no pass a course past this deadline, there are two routes. For both, you need to talk to an advisor asap. One is excused (things like medical/dsp related), while the other is a no-questions-asked schedule change. The issue with the latter is you only get one for your time here at Berkeley, so choose wisely. I believe the deadline for these is either last friday of classes or last friday of deadweek, but let&#39;s be honest, if you don&#39;t reach out to your advisor now you&#39;ll prob forget, and no one wants that blow to their GPA</p>", "created": "2019-10-22T19:07:55Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_5"}], "id": "k2281a5ubdq1gc", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-21T06:11:37Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["policy"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What are general process of P/NP procedure in general?
