I&#39;ve been in similar situations to yours multiple times, and honestly trying to calculate the bare minimum you need to get a grade you want is never going to help you succeed. I know it sounds corny, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this before, but you should always aim to do the best you can. Don&#39;t think that it&#39;s impossible to do well enough to recuperate from your losses, because countless people have done it before you and will continue to do it and so can you. The most important thing to do is to find ways to learn the material so deeply that you can answer any type of question that comes your way. Whether this involves doing countless practice problems or working with peers to help each other learn, you need to do whatever it takes to be as confident as you possibly can come test day that you will do well on the test. Worrying about what exact score you need to get a B&#43; is only going to bog you down, and honestly &#34;one standard deviation above mean&#34; means absolutely nothing until you know what&#39;s actually on the test. Z-score is one of those things that hides the truth behind the test like what was actually tested.\nA more concrete answer to your question is probably around 1 sd above mean, but honestly no one can actually answer this question until all the scores are in and the professors decide the curve. The real answer to how well you need to do to get the grade you want is, of course, as well as you possibly can.", "created": "2018-10-26T00:18:26Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "jnp9q8swms2179", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1548279114}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0l2muelq84t9", "name": "Sai Mandava", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jj6taamfbe4270", "name": "Son Tran", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy24rg2lvit4dr", "name": "Tina Zhao", "photo": "1529347134_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iy24rg2lvit4dr/1529347134_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iy0l2muelq84t9", "jj6taamfbe4270", "iy24rg2lvit4dr"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/21 - 10/27", "bucket_order": 75, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-26T04:56:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jnpjnkn0g8p59p", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I got a 47% on both CS70 midterms (about 1 SD below the mean).
