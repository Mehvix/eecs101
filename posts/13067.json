Almost every company has university recruiters - not necessarily Berkeley specific recruiters.

So to answer your question, yes it gets thrown in and ranked against the general applicants of that program which are college grads/students (at least at in the few big companies I&#39;ve worked at and now) - all college grads and student internship seekers go to a specific student program for hiring and are managed by a specific recruiter for new grads or college students. Maybe that program then has a specific recruiter that filters out Berkeley students for exclusive reading (depends on the company policy) and that&#39;s what you hear about occasionally- I doubt FAANG companies do that since they get thousands of applicants from the best universities around the world.

There are 1000 CS &amp; EECS roughly per year now and there are cogni sci, data science, stats, and math majors  on top of that too. So, if we multiply that by 4 since there are 4 years average - 4000 &#43; 4* the number of students that are interested but not majoring. We are looking at an upward of 5000 per recruiting season from Berkeley alone - and most companies aren&#39;t Berkeley exclusive. So usually its ATS filtered - if it looks good enough through the ATS with an occasional closer look (and whatever filter rule is applied), you get a phone screen/OA/coding challenge and that&#39;s all. Also, the average recruiter spends less than 20 sec looking at your resume - your experience should stand out should you get to that point. It doesn&#39;t matter what a particular recruiter looks for in a resume if a robot removes it/hides it from the recruiter.

This applies to big companies for sure as far as I am aware of. See there are entry level position jobs that are not the same as college new grads. What do I mean, well if you do a job search on FAANG company sites for instance, some jobs make reference to an org or a particular team of a company with the entry level job description and they are not on handshake. If you apply there on the company website, it is managed not by a student/new grad program - but by the org/department itself. It may state the entry level qualifications like 0-2 years of experience, but you are in actuality competing with people that may have far more experience than you rather than new grads. See you might get lucky and find the exact position that is managed by the student new hire program and apply there and it would be almost the same as handshake (the ATS does pick up which university you are from so don&#39;t worry about not getting added to the Berkeley filter if one should exist), but if you are interested in new grad positions - I&#39;d take handshake primarily so your resume goes to the right niche pool and correct competition. \n\nThere is a BIG catch to applying directly to an org vs handshake too however. If you get the handshake new hire and are accepted into the general program, it might take a while to get team matched since this managed program for new grads is not in &#34;sync&#34; with the headcounts of all the other teams and departments in the company (the bigger the company the worse it is). As Google hires are well aware of the team matching phase, it can take a while - with covid it is now taking 4-5 months for general swe and new grads (even that rate is low now due to slow hiring). If you apply to the entry level job in the org directly say Google Cloud Platform as a L3 (entry level) swe, the org is smaller than overall Google and they can match you with the team faster (i&#39;ve heard 3-4 weeks avg - but that&#39;s team dependent and based on a handful of people) since the headcounts are known better and resources are allocated for headcounts. This is for a lot of companies that are big and manage positions per department rather than a student hire program. However, this is all assuming you can get past a new recruiter that compares you against a general pool (not caring so much if you are a new grad) and get past a possible higher hiring bar too with a higher rejection rate.

Almost every company has university recruiters - not necessarily Berkeley specific recruiters.

The ATS will already weed out your resume if it doesn&#39;t have enough keywords and thus will not rank you high in priority for internship/job recruiting. So to answer your question, yes it gets thrown in and ranked against the general applicants of that program which are college grads/students (at least at in the few big companies I&#39;ve worked at and now) - all college grads and student internship seekers go to a specific student program for hiring and are managed by a specific recruiter for new grads or college students. Maybe that program then has a specific recruiter that filters out Berkeley students for exclusive reading (depends on the company policy) and that&#39;s what you hear about occasionally- I doubt FAANG companies do that since they get thousands of applicants from the best universities around the world.

There are 1000 CS &amp; EECS roughly per year now and there are cogni sci, data science, stats, and math majors  on top of that too. So, if we multiply that by 4 since there are 4 years average - 4000 &#43; 4* the number of students that are interested but not majoring. We are looking at an upward of 5000 per recruiting season from Berkeley alone - and most companies aren&#39;t Berkeley exclusive. So usually its ATS filtered - if it looks good enough through the ATS with an occasional closer look (and whatever filter rule is applied), you get a phone screen/OA/coding challenge and that&#39;s all. Also, the average recruiter spends less than 20 sec looking at your resume - your experience should stand out should you get to that point. It doesn&#39;t matter what a particular recruiter looks for in a resume if a robot removes it/hides it from the recruiter. Focus on getting the OA and getting noticed by the ATS first cause that is like an automatic process for a lot of companies.\n\nNow if you are wondering if it makes a difference handshake or company website - it doesn&#39;t for internships (since it is managed by the same program either way), but it does for jobs. This applies to big companies for sure as far as I am aware of. See there are entry level position jobs that are not the same as college new grads. What do I mean, well if you do a job search on FAANG company sites for instance, they make reference to an org or a particular team of a company in the entry level job description and they are not on handshake. If you apply there on the company website, it is managed not by a student/new grad program - but by the org/department itself. It may state the entry level qualifications, but you are in actuality competing with people that may have far more experience than you rather than new grads. See you might get lucky and find the exact position that is managed by the student new hire program and apply there and it would be almost the same as handshake (the ATS does pick up which university you are from so don&#39;t worry about not getting added to the Berkeley filter if one should exist), but if you are interested in new grad positions - I&#39;d take handshake primarily so your resume goes to the right niche pool and correct competition. \n\nThere is a BIG catch to applying directly to an org vs handshake too however. If you get the handshake new hire and are accepted into the general program, it might take a while to get team matched since this managed program for new grads is not in &#34;sync&#34; with the headcounts of all the other teams and departments in the company (the bigger the company the worse it is). As Google hires are well aware of the team matching phase, it can take a while - with covid it is now taking 4-5 months for general swe and new grads (even that rate is low now due to slow hiring). If you apply to the entry level job in the org directly say Google Cloud Platform as a L3 (entry level) swe, the org is smaller than overall Google and they can match you with the team faster (i&#39;ve heard 3-4 weeks avg - but that&#39;s team dependent) since the headcounts are known better and resources are allocated for headcounts. This is assuming you can get past a new recruiter that compares you against a general pool (not caring so much if you are a new grad) and get past a possible higher hiring bar too with a higher rejection rate. Like I said college grad does not mean entry level necessarily - some people have 3-4 years of exp at a small company or free lancing - it counts too.
