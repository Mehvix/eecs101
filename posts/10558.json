Unfortunately this course is strongly oversubscribed. As a project-centered design course, where you complete open-ended projects of your own choice in teams, CS160 cannot scale as well as other CS courses.<br /><br />* The total enrollment limit of CS160 and CS260A, which are room-shared, is 120 students (90 undergraduates in 160, 30 graduates in 260A). We will not be able to increase enrollment to accommodate the level of interest in this course beyond that point.<br /><br />* We are using the registrar&#39;s algorithm for assigning priority in enrollment and waitlist position and cannot make individual exceptions.<br /><br />* Only undergraduate students can enroll in CS160. Only graduate students can enroll in CS260A.<br /><br />Given the large wait list, there is no way to process enrollment requests without causing a lot of disappointment. Many outstanding students who show strong interest in the subject of user interface design will not be able to enroll.<br /><br />To help you make alternative plans, here are some strategies to either enroll in CS160 in the future, or learn similar material at Berkeley and elsewhere:<br /><br />* If you have additional semesters at Cal, we encourage you to try again in the future - CS160 is taught every fall and spring, and increasingly, in summer semesters as well. Summer offerings during the past few years have had shorter waitlists than fall or spring offerings.<br /><br />* DES INV 25, User Experience Design, is a good alternate course. It teaches principles of human-centered design without the implementation focus of CS160. It may be especially appropriate for non-CS/EECS majors. This course will likely be offered next in fall 2020.<br /><a href=\"http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/des_inv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/des_inv/</a><br /><br />* Graduate students can also take INFO 213.This course will likely be offered next in fall 2020.<br /><a href=\"https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/213</a><br /><br />* To learn about human-centered design in general (without a specific focus on user interfaces), you can enroll in DES INV 15, Design Methodology, which is offered in spring 2020:\u00a0<a href=\"https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-desinv-15-001-lec-001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-desinv-15-001-lec-001</a><br /><br />* If you are unable to enroll in a course at Berkeley, but would like to learn CS160 topics on your own time outside of class, the Interaction Design Specialization from UC San Diego on Coursera is worthwhile:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design</a><br /><br />If you are graduating, we are sorry that we could not accommodate you, but we wish you the best for your future.<br /><br />We hope you will all have a successful semester.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "j0b75czu7362rq", "updated": "2019-10-30T21:52:00Z"}], "config": {"is_announcement": 1}, "created": "2019-10-24T21:20:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["announcements"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Unfortunately at this point CS 160 is enrolled to capacity and the wait list is also full.
