Sensor data is constantly being captured, processed, compressed, stored and analyzed. DSP has become the swiss army knife of tools every engineer and scientist should know. The class covers transform tools such as spectral analysis and wavelets to find features in data, processing techniques such as filter design, interpolation and resampling, fast computation algorithms such as multi-rate processing and FFT as well as advanced topics which include compressive sensing and tomography.</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The cream of the crop are the labs in which students get experience in real-world signal processing. These include making a RaspberryPi computer into a sonar, labs with software radio to decode airplane traffic, decode FM station and implementing a digital modem in python-- this will allow you to send SMS messages from a RaspberryPi computer and a Walkie Talki that will be received on your phone! All students will end up with an amateur radio license as well.</div>\n</div>\n<div>Previous semester final project was to send an animated GIF from one computer to another leveraging their implementations of video compression and modems.
