Took 189 before. I think the main thing to understand with this class is that it covers a huge breadth of material and pulls from several courses at Berkeley and Stanford. We go through vision, nlp, gans, rl, etc. I think that they &#34;technically&#34; cover all the prereqs, but the lecture moves through them fairly quickly, and I don&#39;t know if the concepts would 100% sink in. So it makes life a little easier to know stuff from 189. If not you can totally do fine in the class, but you&#39;ll be spending a lot of time focusing on the 189 aspect of the course when the focus is really more on design and applications of deep learning. So taking 189, while not strictly necessary, helps.<div><br /></div><div>For your second question, the main &#34;prereq&#34; would be 189 and some coding background. I don&#39;t think anything else is necessary. I think it does help if you have knowledge about a specific domain covered in the course (like vision/NLP/RL) because the professor does go through research papers in lecture, but again not strictly necessary.</div>", "created": "2020-04-08T08:52:26Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k8r3gpps4s36ca", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-04-08T08:54:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k8r3izg1v3i41o", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>1.

Berkeley&#39;s class guide suggests CS 189 is done prior to doing cs 182, would you say that 189 is necessary to make 182 significantly easier, more understandable?

With respect to the prereqs (Math 53, Math 54, CS189, CS70/Stat134, CS61B), I&#39;ll have done all except CS189. I did 16A&#43;16B instead of 54, and will do stat 140 in place of 134.
