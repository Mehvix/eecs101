Each lecture has around 80 slides as well, so depending on your speed, i&#39;d say reviewing a lecture can take 1-2 hours. The cool thing is that the concepts relate to each other, so there&#39;s always a big picture to a lecture and thus it&#39;ll become easier to learn new material as you progress and gain better insight on past lectures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There&#39;s 1 discussion per week. There&#39;s no homework. There&#39;s vitamins every lecture, graded by completion not correctness and it&#39;s basically multiple choice. If you take the time to complete, could take 10 min. If you want to put random answers, I suppose it takes like 5 seconds lol. Also a lost section every week. I&#39;ve only been able to attend one, and it was great.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are 2 projects. We&#39;ve only done 1 so far. That 1 project, we had 3 weeks to complete. I wanna say the total # of lines coded was maybe\u00a050 max? It might have been less or a bit more? It&#39;s kinda like a 61A project, filling in a function. If you worked with people and went to office hours when stuck, it shouldn&#39;t take too much time. It&#39;s not easy...but it&#39;s really doable, especially if you start early.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1 midterm, 1 final.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6unggda5ox", "updated": "2018-10-19T18:15:19Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/21 - 10/27", "bucket_order": 74, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-27T07:32:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jnr4o5uab8o1gl", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>For EE128, there&#39;s a problem set every week, which takes a good chunk of time, maybe 3 hours per pset, but this may differ with Prof. Sojoudi. Lab reports can take some time since they are not hand written. If you don&#39;t go prepared to labs, or the prelab isn&#39;t correct, lab can become more time consuming, so diligence is due. Even on the days I had managed to finish early, I had about 30 minutes left for labs, but this might just be me being a bit slower.
