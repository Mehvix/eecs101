Just from the syllabus, it looks like 152 covers many similar concepts to 162 in the beginning, like memory hierarchy, exceptions, address translation, etc., at least based on what my friends have told me of 162. But there are plenty of unique concepts covered in 152, like microcoding and CISC architectures, branch prediction, out-of-order processors, VLIW, vector processing, and GPUs. For me, these concepts were the best part of 152 (except VLIW, which is awful). Not sure in what depth multithreading (specifically simultaneous multithreading, SMT) or cache coherence are covered in 162, but these are also neat to learn about. 152 could be a good prelude to that one hardware for machine learning special topics class, but it&#39;s a pretty intense class in its own right. I would only really take it if you want to be an expert on low-level programming / architecture (which you might).\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-06-03T18:31:06Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-06-03T19:11:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>152 is definitely not redundant after taking 162. I haven&#39;t taken 149, but it seems there&#39;s much more overlap with EECS149 &#43; 162 than 162 &#43; 152. There are some topics like address translation, memory hierarchy as mentioned below by Averal that overlap. 152 provides the hardware background that allow one to reason about 162. In 162, we touch hardware at a high-level. For example, modern 162 doesn&#39;t really go over the hardware mechanisms that allow memory consistency in order for locking to work.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think 152 is still worth and I defer to Averal&#39;s comment below with what is unique about 152 (&#43;1 on VLIW being the worst).
