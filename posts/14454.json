I&#39;m very much looking forward to EECS 151 with Bora Nikolic. Do you have any opinion about which of the 151 labs might be better to take first? I was planning to do the FPGA lab in the fall and defer the ASIC lab in the spring, as the ASIC lab lists 105 as a prereq (another reason why I would prefer to take 105 in the fall if I could)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you for sharing all this useful information.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-02-15T20:06:26Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-15T21:07:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kl72k47qhfytb", "subject": "<p>Oh, that&#39;s interesting. 16A and 16B are generally poor preparation for all EE upper-divs, but 151 might be one of the few that isn&#39;t so heavily affected by this, since the class is all about abstraction anyway. For the lecture, I think 61C and 16B are all that&#39;s needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I suppose that, for the ASIC lab, they want you to understand what the basic structure of a MOSFET is so that gate standard cells don&#39;t seem so foreign. Also, I believe they might have you design an SRAM in the ASIC lab, which is almost an analog problem. Beyond this, nothing from 105 comes up in the class (outside of one comparison of the mobilities of holes and electrons for the purposes of device width sizing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In any case, I&#39;ve only ever taken the FPGA lab (the ASIC lab conflicted with a language class I really wanted to take when I took 151), and I haven&#39;t ever felt like I missed out on too much. That being said, I focus on analog stuff and have taken a bunch of analog classes (105, 140, etc.), so that might compensate a bit. Certainly, all PhD students in IC are advised to take the ASIC lab if they are taking 151, since most such students design ASICs as part of their research.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you really want to take the ASIC lab next spring, and they don&#39;t offer 105 in the fall, you could take 130, which will definitely leave you with an understanding of how MOSFETs look and function and teach you about the mobility stuff as well (the first half of 105 is basically just a &#34;poor man&#39;s&#34; 130).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, if I were you, I would just take 151 with the FPGA lab and put a lot of effort into it and then never bother with the ASIC lab afterward. A better use of time in following semesters would then be to email professors in BWRC, BAR, and/or BSAC about getting involved in their research. Especially for groups in BWRC (Bora&#39;s group is one of the first that comes to mind), a lot of the practical knowledge that you might otherwise get from the ASIC lab can be picked up as part of normal research work. Then, you can use that experience to get a nice job in industry or pursue grad school, where you will learn the ASIC lab stuff anyway (probably). I&#39;ve done a few interviews for VLSI roles, and the lecture content from 151 is really the most important thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, as we&#39;ve established, there are plenty of other fun courses to take in the spring.

EE 140 (as 240A) is taken by first-year PhD students in order to prepare for their prelim exam in integrated circuits. Since both EE 140 and EE 240B are required for this exam, they must take 140 in the fall.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prof. Muller typically teaches 140 in the fall and 105 in the spring, and this issue doesn&#39;t come up on an annual basis because usually the department tries to offer both 105 and 140 in the fall and spring. I&#39;m not exactly sure why this hasn&#39;t happened this time around, especially since I believe Apple recently donated some money to fund courses in integrated circuits, since the department is simply not producing enough IC designers. I&#39;d wager that professors just really don&#39;t like teaching virtually and no one wanted to sign up to teach 105 in the fall. I faced a similar problem of nobody wanting to teach 140 during the spring of my junior year (long before the pandemic), and was forced to take 140 that fall with an unfavorable schedule as a result (it was the worst time of my life), so I feel your pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;d encourage you to continue to make noise about this, and hopefully it will get fixed.
