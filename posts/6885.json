In terms of workload, they are about the same, but the type of work differs. 174 weekly psets took me around 5 hours a week, and 161 courseload is pretty light, except for the gargantuan project 2, which spanned about a month, and consisted of 3 subparts, which was horrible(but rewarding). For interesting-ness, I would go with 174 just because I love reading about graph random walks, cover times, probabilistic 2-sat algorithms etc., but the material in 161 was interesting as well if you invest yourself in learning it(I did not :P). For logistics, 161 is better organized by a landslide, as 174 only had around 50 students, and 1 gsi. I&#39;ve heard that recent iteration of 161 has been harder than semesters past. As for 174, if Friedman is teaching it, the lectures are somewhat dry/slow so definitely get comfortable with the textbook. And the quality of discussion will depend on who the gsi is(mine was meh). For usefulness in industry, you could argue that 174 goes over pagerank, but applications in industry are far less ubiquitous than the concepts in 161. There are definitely applications of 174 in industry, but the topics are very lofty and high level, such as probabilistic 2-sat algorithms, and I would have preferred to have done some implementations/labs of the algorithms.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conclusion(My opinion): Of course it depends on why you want to take 174, but 161 wins in most of the criteria you listed.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2018-05-01T09:02:48Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/29 - 5/5", "bucket_order": 99, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/6 - 5/12", "bucket_order": 98, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-06T18:07:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jgv4qkh53mg4uk", "subject": "<p>How difficult are the exams and other parts of the class?
