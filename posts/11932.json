However, &#34;necessary to pass the class&#34; is different from &#34;necessary to really understand the concepts.&#34; Especially if you take it in the fall, the section on EM will feel very confusing (at least for me it did) since I didn&#39;t have a strong understanding of continuous probability and couldn&#39;t really work with conditional distributions well. Also other sections on MLE, MAP, Naive Bayes, GDA, and QDA will require some work to understand, and you will be very disadvantaged compared to people who have already seen these concepts before or have a stronger probability background.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, Sahai (who is teaching it in the fall) really likes to emphasize understanding over memorization. So if you try to just regurgitate formulas from the notes and learn by doing practice exams (which is a valid strategy for some classes), you will probably not do very well (also since the bank of Sahai-style previous exams is smaller). An example is that all the EM examples in the notes were done with Gaussians, but on the final exam we had to derive the update rule with the multinomial distribution, something that would be hard to do without experience in probability. However he does curve well, so the grading distribution will probably be favorable for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what the best course of action would be (perhaps delaying CS 189 a semester to take one of EE 126/127, perhaps just taking CS 189 and filling in the gaps as they arise), but hopefully this advice is useful.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-04-23T01:32:43Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11711": 2, "2214": 1, "2369": 9, "2498": 0, "3688": 8, "4868": 3, "6556": 7, "6999": 4, "7791": 5, "9766": 6}}, "created": "2020-04-20T22:45:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "faculty_advising", "research", "enrichment_opportunities"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Hi guys,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 So I am taking CS189 in fall 2020.
