However, even though CalCentral will allow enrollment into both classes, it is still the student\u2019s responsibility to plan their schedule carefully.\u00a0Departments and faculty are NOT required or expected to accommodate students\u2019 schedule conflicts, and the Instructor of Record may decline to enroll or Instructor Drop a student from a class if they cannot be present for all schedule activities, including midterms and finals.<br /> <br /> Best practice is to check attendance policies for each class and to speak to the instructors before enrolling in time conflicted classes.<br /><br /></li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Waitlist Processing:</strong></li></ol>\n<ul><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will NOT purge the waitlist of non-CS/EECS majors at the end of phase 1 this semester.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the Adjustment Period, wait lists are automatically processed in numerical order based on the waitlist position. A student\u2019s major is NOT taken into consideration when the wait list is processed. During Phases 1 and 2, students who meet reserve requirements for a class will be enrolled from the wait list if there are open seats, even before students with a better wait list position who do not meet reserve requirements.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If enrolling the student into the class will put them over the maximum number of units, the system will also skip the student when processing the wait list.

(As in the past, not meeting a reserve cap or exceeding the unit limit will still prevent students from being enrolled from the wait list.)<br /> <br /> <em>Students on the waitlist for a class are NOT guaranteed to get into the class and should make a reasonable back-up plan.</em></li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol start=\"4\"><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>999 sections will be used for lower division classes for EXCEPT CS C8 and CS 10</strong>.\u00a0These are faux sections that allow students to enroll in the lecture and the 999 section(s) only via Cal Central.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Since students no longer drop/re-enroll when they want to switch sections, they will no longer risk being bumped to the end of the waitlist when they need to make a change.
