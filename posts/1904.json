I kinda assumed that once the adjustment period started today, they&#39;d go through the waitlist\u00a0in order and enroll people if possible (as according to the advisor&#39;s comment in &#64;1860). However as my spot on the waitlist hasn&#39;t changed (and enrollment in the class hasn&#39;t shot up), it appears this isn&#39;t the case. It also seems to be the case though that the last 50 spots (as of the 9:00 am) in the class weren&#39;t reserved/not available because there are now only 48 spots left. So what is going on? If the waitlist isn&#39;t changing like it&#39;s supposed to, where are these new enrollments coming from? When can we expect the waitlist procedure in &#64;1860 to be followed if not at the start of the adjustment period? There is still space in my discussion and I don&#39;t have a time conflict so I should\u00a0get in even if all 130 people in front of me can&#39;t.\u00a0I&#39;m just confused as to when the waitlist will be processed and why I&#39;m being skipped even though it is the adjustment period.</p>", "created": "2016-08-15T16:26:12Z", "subject": "CS 188 waitlist", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "irw95loske04lh", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 1904, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654554741394, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 212}
