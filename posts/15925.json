I&#39;ve already taken Linear Algebra at my community college, but I don&#39;t remember parts of the content nor do I know much about circuits. I&#39;m considering taking 61C &#43; 16B and self learning the circuits, but I worry it will be too much. Any advice or class recommendations would be greatly appreciated!</p>", "created": "2021-10-19T02:35:02Z", "subject": "Course Load as Intended CS Transfer", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kuxh4kfmdsz2nl", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 15925, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539478486, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "enrollments", "student", "suggestion_box", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 181}
