I&#39;ve really struggled with this class, and haven&#39;t done well on past projects, so I fear I may have significant gaps in knowledge that I simply can&#39;t gain elsewhere in the class. If anyone is open to this, I&#39;d appreciate you dropping your contact info, and I&#39;ll email you to discuss logistics. Thank you in advance!</p>", "created": "2021-11-03T04:21:17Z", "subject": "CS 61B Tutoring", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kvj0iz9eurt3g3", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 16029, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539365020, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbkeagi8bed2oi", "name": "Ge Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kiqb8k2lutw23w": 1620777469}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bffcvhw93tq", "name": "Masha Bondarenko", "photo": "1633984604_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ke2bffcvhw93tq/1633984604_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kokj0h76u431lp", "name": "Nigel Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1634968418_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1634968418_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdv1zzhgyc65sp", "name": "Raymond Tan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdzjra3vqlc5nv", "name": "Aryia Dattamajumdar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbkeagi8bed2oi", "ke2bffcvhw93tq", "kokj0h76u431lp", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "kdv1zzhgyc65sp", "kdzjra3vqlc5nv"], "tags": ["student", "tutoring"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 465}
