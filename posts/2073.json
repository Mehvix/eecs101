Now I have some proof that it isn&#39;t so straightforward).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Logically, for anybody to enroll in the brand new section for 188, they would have had to drop their current position and re-add the class. CalCentral does not allow you to switch section waitlists if you are in the lecture waitlist, you MUST drop and re-add. Thus, everybody who changed to the new section that was added today would have moved to the end of the lecture waitlist (position 90&#43;).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A lot of those people did get into the new section, which means that CalCentral definitely moved\u00a0through the lecture waitlist, moved past me (I was at position 61), and moved onto enrolling those who dropped and re-added the class with the\u00a0new section. The straightforward answer for why CalCentral did not enroll me,\u00a0but enrolled those behind me, is that my section was full - but it wasn&#39;t.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I had verified with Ms. Zhang merely hours before that my section (115) had 9 spots open and I was 7th on the section waitlist. Given that there is no more EECS priority after phase II, there is no conceivable way that anybody would get ahead of me on the section waitlist - yet section 115 is now filled up\u00a0and I am still on the lecture waitlist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In your described method\u00a0(iterate through the lecture waitlist, check if person&#39;s section is full, if full\u00a0then skip\u00a0the person, else add the person), there is no way the above scenario could have happened. By the time CalCentral got to me at position\u00a061, section 115 could not have been filled yet based on the number of open seats and my position on the section waitlist. But I was passed over anyways.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is no way for me to reconcile what happened with the explanations I&#39;ve been seeing in this Piazza. I am now 53rd on the lecture waitlist, meaning that\u00a0a total of\u00a0<strong>only 8</strong> people in front of me dropped and re-enrolled for a new section or got into their original section, meaning that almost everybody out of the 40 newly enrolled people got in from behind\u00a0me on the lecture waitlist despite a total of about 20\u00a0open discussion seats previous to the new section.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve resigned myself to sticking with 61C for the semester, but I would love to figure out how this enrollment system actually f-ing works. The explanations on Piazza do not\u00a0explain my experience, and Ms. Zhang indicated that she too was not sure if things actually worked this way.\u00a0This has been intensely frustrating and I want to avoid it for future semesters.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_9", "updated": "2016-09-01T08:10:20Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/28 - 9/3", "bucket_order": 200, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-09-01T13:51:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "iske3iqq9b312h", "subject": "<p>Hi, I am a registered student of 188.
