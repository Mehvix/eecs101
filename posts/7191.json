Is it possible to drop the class at any point beyond the drop deadline (which is tomorrow), withdrawing me from Summer Sessions, and still be able to take it in the Fall or Spring? I&#39;m aware that there is emergency drop available in the Fall and Spring semesters, but I am unsure on whether or not this policy applies in the summer. If I could get a clarification on what exactly is the case, especially by the end of the day/tomorrow, that would be incredibly helpful. Any suggestions on CS 70 in the summer would be much appreciated.
