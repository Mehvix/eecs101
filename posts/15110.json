Like you mention, 162 is project-based and 170 is theory, so it balances out nicely. Also, with 162 being a much heavier workload class (with significant projects, hws, etc.), pairing it with a medium-to-light workload class like 170 (only weekly hws and a single, not-too-challenging project at the end) is a good bet. As long as you manage your time well (making sure to get 162 work done on time to avoid having a week where you have like 4 tasks due together), you should find this a pretty doable combo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With regards to your point on recruiting, I&#39;m not sure how helpful 170 will be. Undoubtedly, the concepts it teaches are really helpful for interviews (graphs, dp, greedy, etc. are all very common interview questions) but there are two issues I see with it: firstly, and most importantly, if you intend to go through recruiting next semester, you will probably be doing it as soon as August starts (maybe even earlier if you&#39;re applying for some of the financial firms). By the time you get to the relevant topics that 170 covers, it will be quite far into the semester and recruiting will be winding down, which greatly reduces the help you get from the class. Secondly, the level of rigor 170 covers is overkill for most interview questions in these topics imo. If you spend your summer wisely and make a plan to self-learn the topics that you are unfamiliar with, you can probably learn all of them in a single week at the level of rigor required for lc questions. Then, more importantly, you can start doing practice problems - as many as you can - which will be so much more impactful then deeply understanding the theory that 170 provides.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>162 &#43; W186: As you mention, this is a slightly less &#34;optimal&#34; combination then the previous one since it&#39;s comprised of two project-based classes. However, I still feel it&#39;s not really a &#34;bad&#34; combination since W186 is a much lighter workload class compared to 162 and pairing the two together should still be nicely doable. However, you would have to strategize and optimize your time a lot more for this combo since there is a very significant chance that some of your weeks will have projects and hw deadlines for these classes intersecting and you want to really be on top of that. Moreover, be aware that 186 has slightly gotten &#34;harder&#34; than previous years, which might make an impact, although in my mind its still a lot easier than some of the other, heavier/harder cs classes. Another factor to consider is that 162 and 186 have a slight (not too significant) overlap in their content. This is nice because you get exposed to similar material through two different lenses and are able to reinforce what you are learning multiple times. All in all, I would give the go-ahead for this combo as well, but just be aware of the caveats mentioned earlier and you should be solid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope that helps :) I&#39;m sorry if this turned out too long but just wanted to share as much as I know.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ji4zyrg94hv49t", "name": "Yasoob Khalid Niazi", "photo": "1530981380_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ji4zyrg94hv49t/1530981380_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6e8eb3bnum167", "name": "Jennifer Tsui", "photo": "1587527554_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6e8eb3bnum167/1587527554_200.jpg", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "name": "Anusha Subramanian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1568670314, "jz3hxjj9pty72p": 1570161955, "jziyku5gomy7aq": 1567368243, "k509eg2kx302ol": 1582491174, "k5eevxebzpj25b": 1579723824, "k5g56y7yegw5xr": 1579592738, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1593927407, "kd0ifacummd56a": 1601598166, "kdl5cn50fh652e": 1597959591, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1602796584, "kk0b2ef3e7x5s3": 1613804250}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jydlyk1lid57di", "name": "Cyrus Bugwadia", "photo": "1567236347_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jydlyk1lid57di/1567236347_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ji4zyrg94hv49t", "j6e8eb3bnum167", "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "jydlyk1lid57di"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-05-16T06:41:30Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-05-16T08:23:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "koqwvnd0bgx1ow", "subject": "<p>That&#39;s a good idea!
