I sometimes take a Berkeley connect course to meet new people in a different subject area. Nutri Sci 10 and Physed 32 are good choices if you&#39;re interested in improving your physical health. If you&#39;re interested in learning about your ethnic background, you can take a history course about the region you&#39;re from (I&#39;m thinking about taking a middle eastern history course) or a language course. There&#39;s also a few random interesting courses I saw in the catalog about how ancient cultures viewed magic. There&#39;s drawing/painting/ceramics classes as well that are pretty fun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are just some of my recommendations, but normally I just look through the catalog for something that looks interesting.
