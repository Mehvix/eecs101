I just think\u00a0we are in an unfortunate situation that seems to be getting worse and worse every semester. This semester it may not be an issue, but if the tech industry continues to grow like it is doing today, UC Berkeley needs to find a way to address the exponential growth in demand for eecs.\u00a0The eecs department, and UC Berkeley for that manner,\u00a0cannot remain a top notch\u00a0university if it cannot meet the demands of its students. I think we call all agree on this point?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Simply because we are only marginally more constrained with enrollment this semester doesn&#39;t excuse the problem that people are super stressed about getting into the classes they want. This is a real problem, how are we going to fix it? Should students just give up and stop speaking out?

Obviously, I think the department is doing the best they can to\u00a0accommodate\u00a0all the demand, but I think\u00a0working with the constraints they have is truly\u00a0unsustainable in the long run. Obviously they are in a super tough spot so give them some room and approach them with a respectful tone.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some students have made a lot of posts recently about enrollment issues,\u00a0particularly regarding the ML/Stat classes. In my view, the admins have somewhat\u00a0underestimated the sheer interest that this field has attracted over the last couple years. I think ML/Stats\u00a0classes have the highest interest/demand (for the better or worse) and much more\u00a0resources needs to be\u00a0allocated there. With prof. Sahai telling students to take EECS 126/127 before 189, we need to make sure to increase the capacity of 126 and 127 to at least 200 and above. However,\u00a0there is perhaps a reason why they are limiting the enrollment: 126 and 127 enrollment usually drops like a rock once some students realize that they cannot keep up with the level of rigor in these classes. So to those people interested in 126/127 who can&#39;t even get on the waitlist,\u00a0stay hopeful. Somehow it ends up working out every semester. It&#39;s quite a\u00a0mess but it ends up working out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Personally, I am planning on writing a blog post about this issue in the future. It&#39;s a real problem that is making an otherwise fantastic school like Berkeley look really unappealing. I don&#39;t like to advertise UC Berkeley as a bad place, but the hope is that by\u00a0speaking out we can place enough pressure on the school to the point that they have to respond.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, I&#39;d like to make a personal call to expand CS 194-129.
