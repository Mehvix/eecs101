I would say that its doable, but not recommended. Personally for me, 169 took a lot of time because of the assignments that weren&#39;t directly programming. The tests are pretty manageable, the hw and project aren&#39;t huge time chunks, but there is a decent amount of preparation, thinking, and discussion with your customer and your group.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For 169, the projects can either be pretty quick, or take forever. It really depends on how well you design for the project before you start coding, and how good you are at debugging. The biggest problem I faced with 162 was fixing unexpected bugs, and redesigning parts of code that we didn&#39;t have a solid grasp on before hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that said, these are my two favorite CS classes at Cal, and I think that taking both of them are very beneficial.
