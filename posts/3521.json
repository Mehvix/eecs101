Like you, I also had 0 EFC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your income may affect your financial aid EFC. However, if your parent/parents that you put on your FAFSA has a income under the zero EFC threshold, you will get the automatic 0 EFC.

Also do keep in mind that the more money you make, the more taxes you pay so working 40 hours a week may not necessarily give you twice as much as if you had worked 20 hours a week. Working part time will probably affect your GPA but I think thats a compromise you would have to make. Also, having an internship over the summer can get you like $15k over the course of the summer which might\u00a0be enough to barely scrape by.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One\u00a0reason for my coming back to school is that I would be able to make more money after I graduate.

This is a view that I have that not many people agree with, but in\u00a0my situation, I made a calculated risk to go into (0% interest) debt in order to have more emergency cash padding.
