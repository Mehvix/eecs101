I am not trying to claim that I am a some sort of genius student. However, I believe I can shed light on this perspective. In my first year at Berkeley, I felt extremely out of place. Many concepts I were learning did not have enough mathematics for me to enjoy. More disheartening were the stories I heard about software development in industry. I often read online that software engineering companies do not care about elegant solutions like UC Berkeley does. In fact, I heard many people say that coming up with nicer, more efficient algorithms are waste of time, and that other people won&#39;t understand them anyways. I do understand the reasoning behind these statements, as they are very logical and do fit the needs of the company, but they were against my goals in CS. The reason why I chose CS was to explore the beauty of the field. I wanted to come up with ideas that were both mathematically elegant and simple. I wanted to work on solving pressing problems in the world with a mathematical/scientific viewpoint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This changed when I started this semester, taking 189 and doing research in AI. Although freshman year, I felt not at home, and regretted choosing CS instead of math as my major, suddenly, I felt like I was right where I needed to be. Finishing problem sets where we used beautiful mathematical properties to actually gain real-world results was very enjoyable. In research, learning how algorithms that control robots are grounded in theoretical concepts (such as inference as control/inverse rl) was the most interesting thing I did in my life. I felt like my need to find beauty and simplicity in the complex world through mathematics was satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am not claiming that AI/ML is the only field that is intellectually stimulating. In fact, I am sure that there are a lot of fields that also have extremely pressing problems just waiting to be solved in elegant ways. However, I&#39;ve always felt like my strive for elegance and simplicity was divergent from the path of a software engineer. Software engineering is a great job--it is very well paid, and does require a lot of creativity. However, I just dislike how, in my experience, it is neither founded in as deep of mathematics, nor as elegant as ML. Hopefully this doesn&#39;t come across pretentious (I am not trying to be, and this is my genuine opinion). Just let me know if it is, or if there parts anyone want to discuss or disagree/agree on.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "jktvex0pksa3z5", "updated": "2019-10-08T06:07:36Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/6 - 10/12", "bucket_order": 58, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-08T07:09:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k1hi7ib4o4249d", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I am a researcher at BAIR and a math double major.
