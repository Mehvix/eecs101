In general, I wouldn&#39;t quit. I&#39;m a recent alumnus in\u00a0the opposite boat, where I&#39;m not certain if programming is right for me. I think our evaluation criteria is still the same, so I figured it&#39;s still worth sharing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. Evaluate your ability to explore other opportunities if you take your current job. If you can work remotely and take any phone screen interviews or onsites easily, then there&#39;s little harm in taking the job and continuing to explore. It&#39;s the &#34;safe&#34; route, but also the reasonable one considering you could juggle both well.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Mentorship is tough to find anywhere. There&#39;s a chapter in Sheryl Sandberg&#39;s <i>Lean In</i>\u00a0about how to find mentorship and grow as a result. The summary is that asking someone to mentor you is bizarre--it just tends to naturally happen if you get to work with someone. As a result, if you want to learn from someone at work, offer to help out with a project. The software engineering realm utilizes Meetups and other public interest group meetups, so if there&#39;s a language, domain, or software experience you want to pick up, you can do that outside of the classroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. TAs are very helpful to talk to, both undergraduates and graduate students. I&#39;ve gone to my 170 TAs when I was having a hard time finding companies that actually use the algorithms we learned in the class (my favorite course, hands down). They&#39;ve done internship experiences, they&#39;ve come from unique backgrounds, and have probably advised students in similar situations. Computer science advisors are helpful too, but TAs are an uncommon source of help outside of the course they teach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. Remember why you got into programming to begin with, and see if those same reasons still apply. When you&#39;re in the thick of it, it&#39;s easy to forget why you&#39;re doing something. As long as your interest hasn&#39;t wavered, go ahead and keep pushing forward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5. Utilize every connection you have. Referrals do get prioritized at large enough companies, so be sure to use them. Facebook groups like the Berkeley linked Computer Science, CS Jobs &amp; Internships, and EECS groups have alumni post job listings there. Handshake got me my first internship. Once you land the right place, you won&#39;t have to beg for referrals until you want to move. From there, be sure to return the favor to people who are in the same position you are now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-12-17T19:01:45Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"1443": 4, "1515": 3, "3589": 9, "4412": 0, "623": 6, "628": 1, "6578": 2, "7202": 8, "8501": 7, "9075": 5}}, "created": "2019-12-17T00:13:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>.</p>", "created": "2019-12-17T03:16:29Z", "subject": "Career Advice?
