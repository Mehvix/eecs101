It&#39;s really the only comms class here I can think of. But there are a lot of pre-reqs (140, 120, 105, 16AB), so it might be awhile before you should take it depending on what year you are. Wireless is quite high level stuff that draws from a lot of fundamental classes.\n\nEE122: Introduction to communication networks.\nEE123: Digital signal processing.\nEE117: Electromagnetic fields and waves -- more for antenna design related stuff.\n\nI think all these classes together would form a good understanding of wireless communications for an undergraduate. Wireless is one of those fields where you kinda need a PhD to really get into, in my opinion. Almost all positions for jobs and internships in wireless require a PhD, from my experience.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-04-21T02:02:14Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-21T01:46:36Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>See title.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2018-04-21T01:46:36Z", "subject": "Any class recommendations to understand the fundamental concepts behind 4G/5G wireless networks?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jg8q3glqb8d1i3", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6714, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549701509, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jl3fm3v4u3z65g": 1539359870}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j47ryojpjcn53r", "name": "James Dalton", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j47ryojpjcn53r"], "tags": ["eecs", "lscs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 311}
