Some students not\u00a0only want to complete coursework but also need the grade\u00a0(e.g. what about the students who really need a certain grade to lift them up this semester so they can graduate? What will forcing them to take a PNP do to their situation?). Some students are having an unusually rough time and definitely want to take the PNP option (which they can anyway, even in a regular semester), they just shouldn&#39;t be penalized by not having their class count for their major. If students feel pressured to keep a letter grade (bc they want to go to grad. school or whatever it may be), that&#39;s still their\u00a0choice (and I think grad school admissions teams will recognize that Sp2020 was a bad semester, so whatever\u00a0the students\u2019 decision, it would be justifiable)--if you enforce PNP, or any one option for that matter, they don&#39;t get a choice; and yet they will still be paying for this semester&#39;s tuition. I think regardless of curves or how other students will perform relative to each other, the issue is whether to allow PNP to fulfill major reqs. (since they can always PNP but it would only be different this semester by allowing this to still count for their major). Other interesting alternatives posed included not going to PNP but instead shifting letter grade bins up for everyone, essentially making it slightly easier to get any given grade and in doing so still maintaining a natural grade distribution, meaning students with strong grades wont just give up their effort since\u00a0they already know they&#39;ll pass, and students with bad situations can try as much as they can and still get a\u00a0pretty good grade (it&#39;s just that the curve will be high, but it will be high for everyone). Or,\u00a0the school\u00a0can just keep the letter grade-default option and\u00a0tell all instructors to\u00a0lighten/adjust\u00a0their grading policies, as many schools have already done, so that students&#39; grades don&#39;t just drop. Since so many people have different opinions, different situations and different plans, and have\u00a0courses of vastly different structure, I&#39;m not sure why changes\u00a0shouldn&#39;t\u00a0just made by instructors on a class-by-class basis, taking into account feedback from their students, rather than choosing one policy for everyone.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jykoiw12p0p400", "name": "Prachi Deo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9s6omub10j", "name": "Jeanelle Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgw2lrsc5g2", "name": "Aditya Ramkumar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jykoiw12p0p400", "is6p9s6omub10j", "jktvgw2lrsc5g2"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_5", "updated": "2020-03-18T20:32:08Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 3/15 - 3/21", "bucket_order": 13, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-03-18T21:01:55Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k7xt9yj8i9n63", "subject": "<p>I personally agree with what MIT did\u2014it\u2019s fair to everyone. \u00a0My TA brought up a great point today about only\u00a0allowing pass/fail: if a student gets an A this semester based on an online exam, that would definitely not be fair to someone who got an A in the same class last semester.

Ignoring the odds of this taking place and given the chaotic times we inhabit, it would be reassuring to know that the EECS department has plans to approach this--like with the 10-hour-TA issue--rather than getting blindsided and forced to come up with a quick fix. Students will be declaring at the end of the semester, so if something like this was handed down from admin, the department would be limited in their available time to react, especially given the level of anxiety-ridden-queries they would recieve from the thousands of undeclared CS-intended undergrads. How do you all think EECS and L&amp;S could rationally\u00a0react while still remaining fair to as many students as possible?</p>", "created": "2020-03-18T00:05:34Z", "subject": "P/NP Semester Impact", "uid": "jwvar2glsjg1pw"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "k7wkea2pxih411", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 2, "nr": 11510, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544366010, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1573593387, "jzw8c1ne84b7li": 1567497947, "k5fwiw4wql642x": 1579917055, "k5oliztmzqy5zv": 1583949796}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jx9vh19he786fy", "name": "Kyle Kishimoto", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8jylx2fl", "name": "Xinyun Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6wdztpg2l2v0", "name": "Ryan Deng", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jiet4ok81x65qy", "name": "Harold H.
