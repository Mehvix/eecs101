Just need to be persistent and keep attending class and keep up with the homework. You need a strong math background though (helpful &#34;prerequisite&#34; courses would be mathy classes EE 126, EE 127, CS 188, CS 189, CS 182, Math 104, Math 110.

They give a high-level overview of many topics that you&#39;ve already seen in 188 and 189, albeit that they do take a slightly more rigorous approach.
