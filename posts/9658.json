And as with every success, there is a good degree of luck involved in getting that A&#43; (professors, test grading, etc.).

And like you said, there is a decently strong correlation between getting an A&#43; vs. an A and having a stronger understanding, but that&#39;s really the only point of difference being discussed here between two candidates. Sure, you can also vet candidates with relevant technical interviews to see if the A&#43; kid is actually legitimately better than the A kid, but everything else equal, you would choose the A&#43; kid as opposed to the A kid. It&#39;s not necessarily significant (i.e. the A wouldn&#39;t break your chances in nearly any case, since you can always try to out-finesse the field), but it is a difference to be considered for the really selective positions.

But the empirical skill or talent or whatever you want to call it of a student with a high GPA with no A&#43;s vs a student with the same GPA and many A&#43;s is indistinguishable at best and in favor of the student with no A&#43;s at worst (because that student likely had much more time to develop skills outside of test-taking). \nI think its very obvious that grades are correlated with likelihood of success, that is obvious. I also think its very clear that this correlation breaks down quite a lot when you consider a pool of students with only high GPAs, there&#39;s a huge diminishing of returns with grades especially when its between an A and an A&#43; which again is literally the same grade at this school in terms of GPA.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_5", "updated": "2019-06-14T20:22:25Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-23T02:38:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jw01razwpd1e8", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "I think the better question is why you would even want to work for someone/participate is something that requires a certain number of A&#43;s at a school where getting an A&#43; doesn&#39;t even give you an advantage in GPA over an A...", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_5", "updated": "2019-05-23T02:38:26Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/19 - 5/25", "bucket_order": 44, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/19 - 5/25", "bucket_order": 44, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-23T11:04:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jw0juev4ddk1vw", "subject": "<p>If you are aiming for some particular program for graduate school, say NLP, mentioning A&#43; grade for classes like 182 or 189 would certainly put you on the edge.
