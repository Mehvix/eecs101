However, since EE/CS 375 are two units and CS 370 is 3 units, if I&#39;m going to be taking one of these alongside my U/GSI position, does that mean that I will potentially have 8-9 units in the summer (4 units technical &#43; 2 units writing &#43; 2 units EE/CS 375 OR 3 units CS 370)? Should I drop the extra 2 unit course I&#39;m taking then if that is the case?
