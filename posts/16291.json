I&#39;m not really an expert on this (yet, I hope), but I plan on going on a similar route as well. There really are a few directions you can take.</p>\n<p></p>\n<ol><li>Firmware (Embedded Systems): This is I think the easiest entrance into the field. Although I know that OP mentioned AI/ML directly, I still feel like this should be considered. Good firmware engineers are much harder to find than good software engineers, so getting into the field is much easier if you are looking for internship/job opportunities compared to roles in ML. To get a firmware internship in a robotics company, simply take EECS 149 and then apply. After landing an internship, getting a return offer/ full time position should be achievable. An undergraduate degree is definitely sufficient, and you can get a masters if the company wants to sponsor you later on. Some related courses that you might want to take is (EE 120, EE123, EECS 127, EE 128, EECS 106a/b, CS 189).</li><li>AI/ML Stuff: There are still a few subcategories, but you can try to take classes / prepare in multiple at once. With AI/ML stuff you would need a bit more than just undergraduate classes to get a role. You would want to do research with professors in the field. I know that with the proper resume, an undergraduate can land a role in the AI/ML fields of robotics. So, if your only goal is to land a job, then your decision tree would be (if job: do job, else: grad school).\n<ol><li>Computer Vision: This field is about how computers recognize the world around it (mostly using cameras and stuff). Some relevant classes would be CS 189, CS 194-26, CS 280, EE 123, EE 120. A related class would be CS 184 (not exactly Computer Vision but you should know graphics for the complete picture for how computers interact with graphics).</li><li>Control &#43; ML: This field is about how to control the robot. I think some modern techniques in control uses ML. Some relevant classes would be EE 120, EECS 127, EE 128, CS 189, EECS 106a/b. If you want to get fancy you should take EE 221/222.</li></ol>\n</li></ol>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k90srhwqdt53ki", "name": "Aryan Jain", "photo": "1598471415_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/k90srhwqdt53ki/1598471415_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kblrvnox2h65e", "name": "Srinath Rangan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh19bukde2t2", "name": "Zeyi (Jackson) Yan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c1n1u3er7jw", "name": "Jainil Ajmera", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kpmyg8co2qa4ox", "name": "Max", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "name": "Ashwin Vangipuram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2ay852qkv5kq", "name": "Tianxin Guo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["k90srhwqdt53ki", "kblrvnox2h65e", "jzdh19bukde2t2", "ke2c1n1u3er7jw", "kpmyg8co2qa4ox", "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "ke2ay852qkv5kq"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2022-01-02T23:32:20Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10365": 1, "10431": 0, "10462": 6, "10580": 2, "11286": 5, "13939": 4, "14514": 9, "15344": 3, "15816": 7, "3936": 8}}, "created": "2022-01-01T14:13:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed", "enrichment_opportunities", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!
