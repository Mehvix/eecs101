This depends on which priority class(es) you're in. INFO 159 gives priority to seniors and grad courses give priority to grad students in that department.\n\nUndergraduate in CS288 this semester here: CS288 is a graduate level NLP course whose goal is to train students to do NLP research. The professors that might teach it are Dan Klein and John Denero, though it was just Dan Klein this semester. It is a really comprehensive class, giving a taste of multiple NLP research areas like language modeling, translation, semantic and lexicographical parsing, etc. The class does a good job of introducing a lot of the material more classical approaches (HMMs, Bayesian) and then going into the modern Neural approaches that are more effective today. Really recommend anyone who can take it to take it, but spaces are limited. Usually there is enough interest from graduate students that the course fills up, so undergraduates sometimes don't get in. This semester in particular, because everything was virtual, everyone who applied and finished P0 got in. However, I don't know if this policy will return for in-person instruction next spring since the professor really wants there to be a more personal interaction between students and faculty. Note that the course is heavily skewed towards research areas and Neural Networks for the projects, so if you want a more thorough course on the fundamentals, Info 159 might be more up your alley and probably easier to get into. \n\nEdit: Asked Klein about enrollment. Enrollment is actually first bottlenecked by the size of the room. Previously, enough graduate students enrolled and attended enough to fill their room (so the fire marshal wouldn't like it if more people attended). The class isn't historically webcast or recorded, so usually there wasn't enough room for all applicants to enroll. However, Project 0 is usually the make or break of the class. He will only allow enrollment for people who complete project 0 and people only dropped because they saw project 0 and decided that it wasn't for them. \n\nIf there is enough room in the physical classroom and you manage to finish project 0, most likely, you will be enrolled. Note that project 0 is not trivial (you can look at it on the website), and is less than 1/4 of the work of an actual project. If it takes you forever to accomplish it, you might want to reconsider.</md>", "created": "2021-04-29T19:04:41Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<md>Like with COVID vaccines, the best one is the one you can sign up for.
