The problem with CS 70 (from the perspective of someone who has repeatedly taught the course) is that many students come in not satisfying the assumed prerequisite of mathematical maturity vis-a-vis both manipulation and modeling, as well as understanding (as opposed to pattern matching to be able to solve problems). It isn&#39;t about needing prior exposure to the concepts. The concepts are introduced in 70 one at a time.

We expect all students to get stuck every week, but we want them to get stuck on the specific concepts and techniques that we are teaching them, not to get stuck because they are having trouble at a more basic level.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-02-23T01:39:23Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "izhq0pm7xui6bd", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-20T03:10:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["other", "cs", "cs-intended", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Are there any statistics courses that have a good amount of overlap with CS 70 and/or can help students prepare for CS 70?</p>\n<p>Would Stat 134 or Stat 140 be helpful for CS 70, or would CS 70 only be helpful for Stat 134 and Stat 140?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asking this as I am planning to double major with CS and Statistics/Data Science.</p>", "created": "2017-02-20T03:14:12Z", "subject": "Stat Courses for CS 70", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Are there any statistics courses that have a good amount of overlap with CS 70 and/or can help students prepare for CS 70?
