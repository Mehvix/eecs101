I think others can comment better on this.\n\nCS 70 is significantly more work and higher difficulty than C8 (and likely Econ 1 or 2).

If you&#39;re an incoming freshman, I wouldn&#39;t take CS 61A and CS 70 together in the same semester, especially your first. The transition from high school life to college life can be quite overwhelming (newfound freedom, personal responsibility for motivation), and 61A and 70 are both workload intensive courses for new college students. Take your time and absorb the material; there&#39;s no need to feel rushed to &#34;get things done.&#34; You can easily find yourself overwhelmed by projects and the problem sets (the problem sets in CS 70 take A LONG time, especially if you have no previous college-level math experience. Proof-based mathematics is\u00a0<em>very</em> different from computation-based math you see in high school/Calculus).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here&#39;s also another big tip:\u00a0<strong>don&#39;t rely too much on AP course experience/knowledge!\u00a0</strong>Yes, having previous exposure can and will be helpful, but I can personally tell you expectations from AP courses/exams are a lot different from expectations in college, especially Berkeley. It varies by professor, but you really need to be able to internalize the material well (which I didn&#39;t really feel was true for AP exams and courses).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;d personally take your first semester:</p>\n<p>CS 61A, EE 16A, Stat 2, Breadth/C8/Class that sounds interesting to you (I personally recommend Astro C12/13! very cool and interesting class with an easy workload)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are just my 2 cents from my experience in Berkeley. Don&#39;t feel rushed to take as many classes as possible. Remember, there&#39;s more to the college experience than academics, especially freshman year. Focus on both academics and social/personal life, without focusing too heavily on one, and your freshman year will be great. :)</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-06-29T19:07:33Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "j4isxzck7cw49f", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": true, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hm0u5ggtpg5", "name": "Carol Marshall", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "instructor", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hm0u5ggtpg5", "iscem14kbsu5vi"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-06-29T19:10:18Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>EE 16a prepares you for CS 70, so you should not take CS 70 your first semester.
