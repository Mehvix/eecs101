I took the courses in separate semesters but both semesters I had relatively intense amounts of technical work paired with each. I would say that, if you have a solid foundational understanding of probability and discrete math and you&#39;re a proficient programmer familiar with C (or even Java), CS70 and CS61C will certainly be doable. I would note that I don&#39;t think having taken 61A/61B alone makes you a proficient programmer (it at least didn&#39;t for me). I would also note that most people don&#39;t have a strong foundation of probability going into CS70. If you don&#39;t feel that you check both those boxes, don&#39;t fret, this is still a doable but rigorous pairing of classes. It is pretty common and so long as you&#39;re not going to be heartbroken with anything but a 4.0 this semester, I think you could do it. If you&#39;re not solid on probability, not a solid programmer, and not willing to get anything except a 4.0, this will certainly be harder but again, achievable. You will probably have to devote a good amount of time learning C (personally what I felt was the biggest PITA in 61C) and you will probably have to review (or learn for the first time) a good deal of the probability underpinnings of CS70.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2020-01-23T07:05:33Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ixztbvf8dxv56m"}], "id": "k5qe6jge8u118f", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/19 - 1/25", "bucket_order": 9, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-23T07:13:43Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k5qeh1g141d4r3", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Data 8 is a corequisite for CS 88 (you have to have taken it or be enrolled in it to take CS 88), while both Data 8 and CS 88 are prerequisites to Data 100.
