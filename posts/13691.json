What kinds of lives can refugees build, what kinds of communities can they forge, even when they are in exile, in transit, or in detention? In this course, we will read and discuss legal and political texts on refugees and their rights, and we will closely analyze literature, photography, and cinema representing refugee experience. We will consider the status of the refugee in relation to that of the citizen and will work to understand how refugees&#39; lives are shaped by both humanitarian impulses and security-driven practices of surveillance and control.\u00a0 In the face of often dehumanizing treatment, how do refugees tell their own stories, and on what terms?\u00a0 Authors and artists will include, among others, Hannah Arendt, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Richard Mosse, and Mohsin Hamid.\u00a0</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div></div>", "created": "2020-11-13T22:01:24Z", "subject": "Undergrad Course - Refugees Studies, Law &amp; Media", "uid": "h87kastcacfxt"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "khgt2wikugj3hk", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13691, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541945135, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "cs-intended", "eecs", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 512}
