If you see the connection on how diagonalising helps you reduce a harder problem to the simple diff eq you learnt in the beginning, you&#39;re set for this topic as most students don&#39;t see this connection.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let me know if you have more questions</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One piece of advice to all students who feel uncomfortable about circuit analysis: Treat circuit analysis as a process of applying a set of mathematical rules. At least at the level of EECS16A/B, circuit analysis is simply a result of graph or network theory, which can all be cast into a simple linear expression $$Ax-b$$, where x represents the voltage and $$b$$ is the current/voltage source. Specifically, after assigning polarity to each current, the circuit is just a directed graph and is described by an incident matrix $$A$$. Selecting a reference node is the same as eliminating one linear dependent column in the matrix $$A$$. Ohm&#39;s law for the simple circuits taught in 16B is nothing but a linear equation: $$y = G(Ax-b)$$, where $$G$$ is a matrix with all the conductances stored on the diagonal and y is the current. KCL or KVL are extra constraints on the linear equation: $$A^T y = 0$$. The techniques you are taught in 16B has nothing to do with physics, so don&#39;t be intimidated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know lots of CS students probably don&#39;t have the incentive to learn circuits, so let me show you an interesting perspective: One common practice in engineering is to convert a problem into a minimization problem with some constraints. If you combine all the equations I mentioned above, you will get $$A^T G A x = A^T G b$$, you immediately realize that this is the normal equation for weighted least squares. Inspired by the fact that least square is also an optimization problem, we convert the normal equation into a quadratic program: $$min \\frac{1}{2} y^{T} G^{-1} y - b^T y$$ subject to $$A^Ty = 0$$. The first term of the quadratic cost function is precisely the total power dissipated by the network (ignore the 1/2) if you have a current source. (If you take EECS127 later, you will learn that every optimization problem also has a dual problem. Surprisingly, the dual problem also minimizes the total power, but this time with a voltage source.) Nature is doing the optimization problem for us, and the circuit theory is just one example. Other optimization problem that is naturally solved including the principle of least action and Fermat&#39;s principle. It&#39;s true that 16A/B doesn&#39;t do a great job of revealing the fascinating essence of the circuit theory, but I do believe the material itself is very beneficial to learn about. The same perspective can be applied to the control part of 16B. They won&#39;t tell you that a differential or difference equation also has an adjoint equation (think about it as the transpose of the equation); moreover, solving the adjoint equation is the same as the idea of backpropagation for a neural network, which is equivalent to dynamic programming.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2020-06-09T01:12:22Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I got an A&#43; in 16B when I took it in Fa19 (im probably in the small minority where I love 16B and going to pursue EE).

People often to struggle to see the concepts when studying/taking exams and default to memorisation which doesn&#39;t work in 16B. For example (you probably won&#39;t understand this now but when you take the class you will see it), they teach you to solve simple diff. eq but then they teach you diagonalization as a change of basis much later. If you see the connection on how diagonalising helps you reduce a harder problem to the simple diff eq you learnt in the beginning, you&#39;re set for this topic as most students don&#39;t see this connection.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let me know if you have more questions</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2020-06-05T23:51:54Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "kb2v4ugpn5b5pj", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1551343370, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548558104, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1574919273}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "name": "Priyans Desai", "photo": "1598406517_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjs6ge7urqc129/1598406517_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgcjtoby4zk", "name": "Anita Shen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jwslfmrdirb540": 1563401585, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1576411252, "k509eg2kx302ol": 1588914914}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "name": "Parth Gupta", "photo": "1567400054_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwu0ujo2fbl4tc/1567400054_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kd0ifacummd56a": 1599633405}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzoqqipkxx270r", "name": "Animesh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "name": "Gilbert Feng", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jj6taamfbe4270", "name": "Son Tran", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjvub57seg055m", "name": "Ye Joon Han", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "name": "David Au", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kc3n2cogo8h4fc", "name": "Jewook Ryu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bzrwgmhs60y", "name": "Mialy Rasetarinera", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jjs6ge7urqc129", "jktvgcjtoby4zk", "jwu0ujo2fbl4tc", "jzoqqipkxx270r", "is6p9mf96y2ty", "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "jj6taamfbe4270", "jjvub57seg055m", "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "kc3n2cogo8h4fc", "ke2bzrwgmhs60y"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-06-05T18:36:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Hi<div>I am intended L&amp;S cs major and I just took math 54 last semester.
