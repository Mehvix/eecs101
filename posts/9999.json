Right now I&#39;m enrolled in 106a/149 which are both classes that pretty much need to be done. I&#39;m becoming increasingly interested in both ML and IoT so I want to take 126 (Sahai said both 127/189 is material that can be self taught, but not 126) and want to at least take 123 to understand how IoT products work. I&#39;m a good self learner but I also understand there are some subjects that can really only be learned in a formal academic setting.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-08-09T01:34:57Z", "subject": "is ee123/162/126 an impossible schedule?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jz3fu3w29v32qi", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9999, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546073477, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 246}
