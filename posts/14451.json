Where I come from, graduating from a t20 college is essential to getting a prestigious job and garner respect from family members and friends. Most other CS programs in t20 schools are very selective. CMU selects only around 200 students and CMU is not even traditionally considered to be in the t20 schools.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although I respect and agree with your opinion that doors should be opened to minorities, while UC Berkeley was in a financial crisis, the faculty has lived up to Berkeley&#39;s obligation as a public school and admitted far more students into the cs department than it could handle. As this is becoming impractical as the number of students interested in CS is growing exponentially, I think Professor Hug, Professor Denero, and other EECS faculty had been very thoughtful in coming up with creative ways to open doors for students who haven&#39;t been coding since high school. As they mentioned, CS backgrounds in your UC application won&#39;t give you an advantage (which is very rare for private schools) and there are still multiple gateways for students to declare CS as discoverers (although they are selective). At USC/Ivy leagues, they will judge where your parents went to school, your parent&#39;s occupation, your scores and extracurriculars, and judge how likely you will be an elitist member of society in 20 years.

It is perfectively reasonable for students to select other institutions and get into top-notch companies and have successful futures. Practically speaking, if you put 100 students who scored 1500&#43; on the SAT with 4.5&#43; GPA in a room, of course, they will be super proud of their accomplishments as they earned the title of &#34;UC Berkeley student&#34; and be &#34;elitist&#34; in your words about it.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1565840066, "jw6kndsic346lm": 1562564221}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvexhlmpa3zk", "name": "Sunay Poole", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "name": "Ashwin Vangipuram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jmfdrw30boCs", "name": "Jeff Chen", "photo": "1604267372_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jmfdrw30boCs/1604267372_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1548797126, "jkjt85cc6fc4jx": 1541740603, "jko89qm4qo732a": 1543432634, "jqr7hfmf4v74e": 1552945044, "jr6wgkg4hqh19q": 1548796612}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhrzrklubu41ah", "name": "Hamza Qadeer", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kjvxxnu0l1t5w4": 1620149629}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnoszbx9j1vq", "name": "Raymond Ji", "photo": "1628044410_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnoszbx9j1vq/1628044410_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvexhlmpa3zk", "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "jmfdrw30boCs", "jhrzrklubu41ah", "jzlnoszbx9j1vq"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_9", "updated": "2021-02-14T02:30:20Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 2/7 - 2/13", "bucket_order": 41, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-14T02:57:38Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kl4k67xf3oy11p", "subject": "<p>Did you mean to respond to my post?

It might be less, we'll see. We're constrained in two ways: budget and faculty bandwidth. \n\nBudget wise: the department is running huge deficits and the temporary measures that have kept us temporarily above water cannot persist. This is true even with many classes now operating much leaner than before (lower $$/student). \n\nFaculty bandwidth wise: Huge classes have led to more co-teaching, which leads to fewer course offerings. Our grad classes have taken the biggest hit. And it's not just in classes, but in opportunities to pursue research, get mentorship, letters of recommendation etc. Some faculty are also getting pretty burned out. While the workload doesn't scale linearly with number of students it does grow with student population. It is very hard to effectively run a thousand person class, run a research group, and do all the various service things that faculty to do. \n\nIf this proposal is passed we'll do a more careful analysis of just how much we need to cut to get to a sustainable place. And even if we do cut by 500, hopefully we can fundraise to hire more TAs and faculty to continue growth later. \n\nYour concern is indeed a massive concern. 500 people is a lot of people who don't get to do CS at Berkeley. There are a few mitigating factors that make me feel better: One is that data science is staying open. Since data science is an interdisciplinary field where a student has a focus outside of the core discipline itself, that gives us more breathing room. That is CS students might take something like 15 EECS courses total, but data science is more like maybe 7 or 8. Given that lots of students are able to get on track for a professional career shortly after 61B, it may be that all the upper divs like W186/164/162 etc. are not truly necessary to get your foot in the door to the technology industry, if indeed that is your goal. I also think that data science is more likely to build students into people who are going to contribute to society rather than create widgets for extractive businesses. After all, data science is about producing insight. A bit of a digression, but it makes me feel a little better.\n\nAnother mitigating factor is that CS at Berkeley produces only a small fraction of CS degrees in the state/world. There are also all of the other UCs and Cal State schools. I have a suspicion that many of our less prepared students would have had a much better experience at say Davis. I went to a way less intense undergrad (UT Austin) and would not have had nearly as good a time if I had been a Berkeley undergrad. Again this is only a vague suspicion and is a mitigating factor that makes me feel better. \n\ntl;dr Hopefully we won't have to cut as much as 500. Even if we do, hopefully we can continue to grow in the future back up to meet demand.</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jykoiw12p0p400", "name": "Prachi Deo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhwn369f6ik", "name": "Kevin Zhu", "photo": "1629851676_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvhwn369f6ik/1629851676_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1586922894}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9qynt5gz9", "name": "Suraj Rampure", "photo": "1606964385_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p9qynt5gz9/1606964385_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1632956641_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1632956641_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "name": "Anusha Subramanian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfh90l6t4e5", "name": "Carlo Revelli", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jykoiw12p0p400", "jktvhwn369f6ik", "is6p9qynt5gz9", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "jktvfh90l6t4e5"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "hzd9m3irk83yj", "updated": "2021-02-14T16:26:12Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 2/14 - 2/20", "bucket_order": 40, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-14T16:29:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kl5d6hznna03c3", "subject": "<md>@Abinav: \n\nRough number of CS students graduating per year (B.S. or B.A.) vs. number of CS faculty:\n\nMIT: 680 : 94\nStanford: 330 : 63\nCMU: 173 : 70\nUW: 450 : 72\nBerkeley; 1100 : 61\n\nBerkeley numbers above include CS oriented EECS students and L&S CS.

IMO, this is absolutely more important than the small benefits we would receive by slashing the program size. I would support a 10% reduction, so enrollment is more guaranteed. Any further reduction is not worth it. Classes are fine as how they are right now. They certainly could be improved, but most classes are not dumpster fires. Sure, they could definitely be improved with smaller classes and more individualized help. And sure, stress can be moved to high school instead of college.

While the workload doesn't scale linearly with number of students it does grow with student population. It is very hard to effectively run a thousand person class, run a research group, and do all the various service things that faculty to do.\n\n>If this proposal is passed we'll do a more careful analysis of just how much we need to cut to get to a sustainable place. And even if we do cut by 500, hopefully we can fundraise to hire more TAs and faculty to continue growth later.</md>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-02-14T21:04:34Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/14 - 2/20", "bucket_order": 40, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-15T07:43:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kl69tn6ofuc5gx", "subject": "<p>I feel like you can&#39;t just throw money at this problem and try to solve it. One big factor that is hurting minorities I think is the exam-based assessment system many CS classes have chosen to take due to huge class sizes. It hurts students who aren&#39;t great exam takers and can&#39;t gain more ground in projects since exams are the only thing that matters in their grade and doesn&#39;t reward creativity and different learning paces students may have. In CS50 at Harvard, with the low faculty to staff ratio, students can choose to pursue their own projects at the end of the semester, which accounts for a lot of their grade.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, it seems like you have had great access to what the CS major had to offer by getting into clubs like CSM and becoming a UGSI, which is great, but many students are simply not given the opportunity to improve and gain new research and teaching experiences due to the competitive &lt;5% acceptance rates from CS-related research opportunities, clubs, and teaching opportunities. Many students aren&#39;t able to be seen as qualified by companies after graduation, not because they were lazy, but since everyone rejected them their freshman/sophomore year and are left with nothing to do but attend classes. This was a big problem for my peers and many others (I&#39;m assuming) who are intended/declared CS and EECS. You just can&#39;t funnel money into the program, hire more TAs and fix these problems. We have to reduce the student-faculty ratio. The biggest reason why UCLA is ranked higher than Berkeley in undergrad is that UCLA cared about what environments students were studying in and worked to improve the student/faculty ratio and consequently, have a lower admissions rate.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I care a lot about students being exposed to CS, but I care more about students being exposed to lots of research/teaching/extracurricular opportunities (not the &lt;5% acceptance rate Berkeley ones), are in a comfortable breathable environment, and that students are accessed in all areas when assigning grades, not just exams. The current proposal will fix a lot of these problems, and I think it is a better way forward.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p815tz306kj", "name": "Averal Kandala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"j9j0udrxjjp758": 1521427072}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewwo2ic82zi", "name": "Owen Zhang", "photo": "1522084310_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6lewwo2ic82zi/1522084310_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "name": "Zaynah Javed", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdk8d4o3j66j", "name": "Anusha Subramanian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p815tz306kj", "j6lewwo2ic82zi", "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "jzqdk8d4o3j66j"], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_9", "updated": "2021-02-15T07:43:27Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-14T20:10:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kl5l34n5sgfv4", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>This proposal is very concerning to me for several reasons. First, is the process. Although not directly related, it&#39;s very reminiscent of the housing crisis and the approval process for developments. The thousands of people who will be greatly affected in both cases are not here to represent their views - instead we have students who won&#39;t be affected at all. Obviously, people would be much more apathetic to these changes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, where is the communication or effort in finding an alternative solution that doesn&#39;t drastically affect thousands of students in the future. Is this the only option or simply the easiest to implement? If the problem is funding, instead of cutting costs by 66 percent, could we find new sources of funding and have all those avenues been attempted? There are probably tens or hundreds of thousands of alumni in the tech industry, and perhaps if an urgent campaign was even attempted, this problem could be greatly reduced through a fund. I find it hard to believe that a public campaign with student backing couldn&#39;t raise a lot more money through alumni or tech companies in one of the wealthiest industry and community. Couldn&#39;t the expansion in 61c last semester from Apple be emulated in some way? And it seems like there are only a few classes that are extremely popular and need to find additional funding.\u00a0 The point is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to raise revenue, either through more lobbying of the administration or finding new sources of revenue in creative ways. We could innovate with different models and be on the forefront of new educational systems. It could be that all of those public efforts fail, but it certainly would not hurt, and could reduce the impact to 1/2, 1/3 or a 1/4 cut instead. This proposal just seems like the easiest path, but affects the greatest number of people negatively. And if we&#39;re having problems with fundraising now, why would cutting access to students help in any form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third, as the leading public university, we should raise the bar in equitable access. This proposal seems to hurt one group tremendously. The people who would not have majored in CS if not for the excellent CS community, teachers, and TA&#39;s. I count myself as being part of that group. Yes, there are problems with large class sizes, and we can do much better in mitigating those problems. But the fact remains that these large class sizes and the large CS community at Berkeley has contributed to a culture of excellence and pride. Only at Berkeley can someone with no experience switch into CS, join clubs like CSM, and become a valued and excellent TA during the semester or even one of the summer instructors. With this proposal, we would be losing a massive group of people who contribute to the success of Berkeley. I saw a reply above saying that students who struggled to declare might have a better time at another UC, like UC Davis. I had a difficult time getting past the cap where I had to late drop a class, but I would certainly say that I belong here and would not wish to go anywhere else for an easier path. Furthermore, the career outcomes and graduation rate for CS and EECS now are essentially equivalent.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, does this proposal even solve the problem? Essentially, we are telling future students that whenever they discover CS is right for them, they should have a DS degree instead. It&#39;s already obvious what will happen in a few years. DS will be extremely full, and those students will want to take CS classes as well. The demand for CS classes is not going to go down even if the degree is not in CS. So the most likely outcome is those students who would have graduated with a CS degree instead graduate with a DS degree with a much harder time in enrolling in classes. If the base problem of demand for CS classes won&#39;t decrease, what is the point of this proposal then? It just pushes the problem into a different department and keeps pressure on CS classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few years ago, I heard a proposal from a professor that made a lot of sense to me and I&#39;m wondering why it was not taken. It was to essentially have a CS honors track where they could take specialized small classes and a regular CS track where the classes were large and could expand with TA&#39;s and graduate instructors teaching. This proposal actually addresses the core problem - demand - and doesn&#39;t just cut the department by 2/3&#39;s. Obviously there are different problems, but they are much better problems to have.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TLDR: This proposal doesn&#39;t address the root problem of demand, causes equitable access problems, and is extremely drastic. The people who would be most affected have no say. Have we tried to address the problem of funding in other ways that actually increase funding rather than lower costs? And there are better proposals that would actually address the problem.</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhwn369f6ik", "name": "Kevin Zhu", "photo": "1629851676_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvhwn369f6ik/1629851676_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jcitago21ee5vi", "name": "Alison Dowski", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c0xqi2xb6ym", "name": "Jonathan Sy", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"j9j0udrxjjp758": 1521427072}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewwo2ic82zi", "name": "Owen Zhang", "photo": "1522084310_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6lewwo2ic82zi/1522084310_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1579723281, "jzmxfhaex9yto": 1572483967, "jzyjkn4fyf63f1": 1574471185, "k5g56y7yegw5xr": 1582265264}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzvg95ctx5vue", "name": "Ishika Prashar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhwn369f6ik", "jcitago21ee5vi", "ke2c0xqi2xb6ym", "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "j6lewwo2ic82zi", "jzvg95ctx5vue"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jjs6h67kc551j0", "updated": "2021-02-14T20:10:59Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 2/14 - 2/20", "bucket_order": 40, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-02-16T04:25:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kl7i7d9lfr0q2", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>As someone who chose to focus in EE rather than CS in large part because of the awful culture and environment created by the GPA cap, I find this conversation fairly interesting. The undergrad EE program has, in a sense, the opposite problem to that of the undergrad CS program(s): all students that graduate having focused in EE are &#34;discoverers&#34;, since most are admitted against the higher standard of the EECS (really CS) filter and all EECS lower division coursework is designed with CS as the primary focus. This leaves people in the EECS (really CS) community here with the distorted sense that EE is somehow a dying field or something like that, when, in fact, it is a very popular major at most other universities (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Henry_Samueli_School_of_Engineering_and_Applied_Science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EE was the second most popular undergrad engineering major at UCLA in 2018</a>) and opens pathways to many stable, high-paying jobs after graduation. This might be unimaginable to people in this community, but, in my internships, I&#39;ve often encountered people that were blown away that I got the chance to study EE at Berkeley and completely dumbfounded when they learned that very few undergraduate students actually take this path here.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This might be a crazy idea (and I know people in the department think so, since it was shot down when I suggested it in this Piazza four years ago), but maybe making an &#34;EE-intended&#34; path is something the department should try as well.

option).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like I said, it&#39;s probably crazy of me to want to expand access to Berkeley&#39;s fantastic EE upper-div classes to applicants that are passionate about EE but
