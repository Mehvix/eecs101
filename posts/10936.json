You may want to review Java syntax and the more nuanced things (e.g. static types, classes, etc.). If the leetcode problems involve static typing and similar aspects of Java, go ahead and do them, or just try implementing some 61A programs you wrote (especially the OOP assignments) in Java just to get the syntax down. If you\u00a0are solid on this part you at least will have a breezy first month or so of the class, which will give you time to prepare for future material and focus on you other classes too. The later\u00a0topics of the course are more conceptual, but the course (unlike many CS courses here) does a really\u00a0thorough job of teaching you the material at a pretty nice pace so imo reviewing beforehand is not super necessary. The main difficulty for me was the exams, for which it is best to do past exam problems; but this\u00a0is something you can do during the semester.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-12-11T20:51:12Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k41rqowjmcw1ey", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 12/8 - 12/14", "bucket_order": 20, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-12-12T18:52:19Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k432xngxsoh2am", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Since you are taking it with PNH, prepare yourself into doing large projects. Prepare yourself on thinking about design. Try looking at the spec of this semester&#39;s projects especially the difficult ones like Signpost and Gitlet, see what do you make of them. Tbh, there is no point in learning Java over the break. As it has been the norm of CS classes at Berkeley - they don&#39;t teach you programming languages, but the concepts of programming and languages are merely just ways you can fo that. If you are ready to adapt, picking up Java on the go wont be difficult.\u00a0<div><br /></div><div>You can have a look at different data structures and try learning about them. But my biggest advice would be to have a look over the projects. They are challenging and time-consuming, so you will have to spend some time with it. Unlike Hug&#39;s projects, PNH won&#39;t ask you to implement data structures for your projects at least, because his projects are more on the Software Engineering side than pure Data Structures, so having a look at the projects shouldn&#39;t be too overwhelming. If you have taken 61A, try seeing if you can implement them in Python and also brush up LinkedLists and Trees from 61A.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hopefully that&#39;s helpful\u00a0</div>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "updated": "2019-12-12T18:52:19Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10003": 5, "10596": 8, "10598": 9, "10629": 7, "1329": 3, "2662": 8, "3922": 6, "4256": 4, "4321": 2, "4505": 8, "5013": 3, "5068": 3, "5540": 4, "5681": 1, "5744": 1, "5773": 2, "585": 3, "6076": 9, "621": 4, "6404": 0, "6902": 2, "6947": 1, "7294": 5, "7680": 5, "8350": 0, "8372": 9, "8417": 4, "9030": 9, "9623": 7, "9976": 6}}, "created": "2019-12-11T08:20:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Any advice for preparing for CS61B over the break?
