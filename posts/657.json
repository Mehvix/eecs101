Being on the degree list means you&#39;re official ending your studies and are ready to receive your diploma. Typically, a student adds themselves to the degree list while registering for their last semester of courses. A student may also add themselves to the <a href=\"http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/Late%20Add%20to%20DegList%202page%202015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">degree list by paper petition</a>, however this is due by the end of the 12th week of the semester. If you wish to try to petition to add after that deadline, you should complete the form, obtain a memo of completion from a CS Advisor, and write a statement explaining\u00a0(1) why you didn&#39;t add yourself sooner, and (2) why it&#39;s important you graduate this semester.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are not added to the Fall 2015 degree list, you may also choose not to take Spring 2016 courses (saving a semester&#39;s tuition) and graduate in May.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2. The graduation ceremony is independent of degree list status. Students may register for the campus-wide December commencement ceremony at\u00a0<a href=\"https://commencement.berkeley.edu/\">https://commencement.berkeley.edu/</a>. The department does not have a December ceremony.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Feel free to email me if \u00a0you have more questions!</p>", "created": "2015-12-02T17:42:59Z", "subject": "", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "id": "ihp3qf12b4170d", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "h3gb28hgmd74wh", "name": "Jamshed Vesuna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["h3gb28hgmd74wh"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2015-12-02T04:05:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>I am a senior and will have finished all of my requirements for a CS degree by the end of this semester.
