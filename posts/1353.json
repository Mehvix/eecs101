Next fall, as a junior, I am planning to take: CS 61C, Stats 135, Stats 133 and a 3-unit breadth course. My phase I is tomorrow and I am thinking of\u00a0signing up for Stats 135, Stats 133 and the breadth course for full 10 units. However, I am a little worried as to whether I will be able to get into CS 61C during phase II. As a junior in L&amp;S, regardless of whether I am declared or not before next semester starts, would it be possible\u00a0to get into 61C successfully during Phase II? I really want to take 61C next semester so that my choices of CS upper divs will become more flexible.
