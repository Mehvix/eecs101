I am an outspoken person, so I sincerely apologize if my words offend you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have personally found reneging as a bad behavior morally, especially given the fact you have signed the offer and accept certain social-binding convention. But judging other people purely based on one single case and abstract morality is always not appropriate; after all, there are so many other factors that can reshape people&#39;s minds and force others to make a new decision. If the new company is really your dream company, and you believe it will be a better fit for you than the old company be, reneging probably will better off both you and the old company.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bearing some cold words from the old company is inevitable and reasonable; after all, as I said above, I personally hold a strong faith against reneging. Will reneging affect your future careers? I personally think in this fast-paced and competitive world, your old company people will be upset by your decision, but they probably won&#39;t try to ruin your career, since this kind of revenge is just so petty and childish. Is that possible that someday in your future career, you run across an important figure who has remembered your renege and subjectively gives you a bad comment? Everything is possible, but you may decide the probability and bear some risks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#39;s not uncommon that people renege. Some people just change their minds. Some people just encounter a surprising occasion. Some people are realistic and juggle with offers to ensure a backup and maximized achievement. As long as they don&#39;t breach the legal terms, they probably won&#39;t receive many &#34;penalty points&#34;. So please make sure your internship offer doesn&#39;t have any legal binding terms you need to follow. Is it moral to do that? Probably not. But our world is using the laws, not subjective moral standards. Companies themselves also fire people if it&#39;s legally feasible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tl;dr Your reason is not a bad reason.

I know this will burn the bridge with HR at my old company, which I&#39;ve come to terms with. what I&#39;m not sure about is-- how will this affect my personal connections at my old company?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>say if I personally tell my old manager I&#39;m reneging (I don&#39;t want them to find out later from HR so I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll have the awkward chat) I understand they&#39;ll be annoyed now, but will it permanently prevent me from fostering a professional relationship with them, in like 10 years? what about any recruiters who I was in contact with at the old company? I&#39;m not expecting a super friendly of-course-I&#39;ll-refer-you relationship as I know rebuilding that trust will take a long time; I just want to avoid being on anyone&#39;s toes permanently. I&#39;m also afraid that the old recruiters/managers might actively say things against me if I come up in a conversation, but I&#39;m being told by some people that this doesn&#39;t really happen and no one&#39;s going to be &#34;out to get me&#34; just bc I reneged an internship offer. this is stressing me out but it would also be stupid for me to not give the dream company a shot, so any input would be helpful, thanks!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>if it matters, the (true) reason I plan to give for reneging is that the location for the company is not somewhere I can work full time, and as a junior I want to intern somewhere that I can see myself working ft (I wouldn&#39;t mention what company I&#39;m going to). is that a bad reason?</p>", "created": "2021-02-13T04:10:26Z", "subject": "impact of reneging on personal connections down the road", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kl37c0139047n8", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 14448, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541103624, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is0qs2ektcs288", "name": "Ruby Aujla", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kkbr3rs9u4w7oy", "name": "Joshua Samuel", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jkznpy1s5en5b5", "name": "Alina Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j2gwop5nl1t30c", "name": "Ankur Jain", "photo": "1600926456_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j2gwop5nl1t30c/1600926456_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1596323170_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1596323170_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjzd0ebjf50lh", "is0qs2ektcs288", "kkbr3rs9u4w7oy", "jkznpy1s5en5b5", "j2gwop5nl1t30c", "jktvhcjpozd5xg"], "tags": ["peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 542}
