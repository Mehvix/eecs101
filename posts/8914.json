If you&#39;re the type that likes to take 2-3 days off for w/e reason, this class isn&#39;t going to work for you. It&#39;s a constant grind. Yes, you get less problem sets, but it&#39;s still a lot of work and\u00a0weekly problem sets. However, 70 will probably be the only thing you&#39;re doing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. I personally wouldn&#39;t worry about that because you can still crush CS 70 during the semester, but i&#39;ll try to answer to the best of my knowledge. I think an internship will definitely improve your skills as a PM, which will then make next year&#39;s search easier(PM internship on resume, experiences you can discuss in interviews, actual skills that can help land another internship/job). I can&#39;t say how recruiters think, but if you&#39;re going into PM work, I can&#39;t see DS vs CS degree affecting chances?

Oh no idea!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conclusion: I think short term(first job, maybe second) your degree could be a detriment. But long term, your experiences(and possibly school name, but probably not) will be the main factors of getting interviews.

Is it actually easier to take CS 70 over the summer, or would it still be okay to take it in the fall with Prof. Sinclair and Prof. Song (provided that I would try to take a lighter course load with it)? Would my chances of declaring be hampered if I don&#39;t take it over the summer?\n2. Is taking this internship more valuable than (God forbid it doesn&#39;t happen but) being able to declare the major?
