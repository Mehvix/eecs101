During my time there I consulted with my colleagues and various engineering managers exactly about this, and here is what they have to say:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) Take it easy. This isn&#39;t a life or death decision and there are plenty of successful people who got their masters, and plenty who didn&#39;t. You can&#39;t go wrong with either, it&#39;s what you make of yourself that matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PLEASE keep in mind the following is only the feedback from a few people. It is NOT my personal opinions, nor does it put down those with a masters in ANY way. They are extremely valued members of teams across the globe; like I said, it&#39;s what you make of it, not that you have it (or not).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) From a practical standpoint, their answer tl;dr is no, don&#39;t do a masters. For reference, the people I talked to did get their masters, but only because they needed it to work in the US on a visa. Barring that particular need for a masters, in their experiences industry experience was considered more valuable and employable than the knowledge a master&#39;s confers to you, and those with more industry experience rise faster and achieve higher &#34;career ceilings&#34; as you put it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) A master&#39;s sits at an uncomfortable position educationally (especially a 1-year one). Top companies will hire either undergrads for SWE positions, or PhDs for research positions. Master&#39;s graduates are almost never taken for research positions because PhDs eclipse them, so they end up competing for the same jobs as undergrads in SWE positions, because those positions honestly only require CS 61A, 61B, 70 and 170 knowledge.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for ML/AI. My team was an AI research group at Amazon (I won&#39;t say which), and master&#39;s graduates enter at the same base level roles than undergrads. Only PhDs (or truly *exceptional* masters) were ever considered for the higher paying research roles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) Now let&#39;s talk about industry experience. In my team, undergrads are promoted like clockwork 1.5 years in. So by the time a master&#39;s of the same age seeks to join the workforce, the undergrad who didn&#39;t do the masters and went straight in is already a level above (in compensation and title) the role the master&#39;s would get, because the masters people (as mentioned above) don&#39;t get considered for higher starting roles than an undergrad would be, so have to start from the bottom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5) Why is industry experience more valued? Coding in a real company is radically different from an academic setting. Nothing really prepares you for it in academics. Me and many PhDs that joined around the time I was there constantly asked a 23 year old undergrad who had been at the company for a year for help. This undergrad had 1 more year experience, and knew all the systems, development protocols, quirks and kinks, accounts and permissions, testing frameworks, directions of change etc. He had gone through innumerable errors that we were going through every day. At the end of the day, companies want to make money, and the guy with the experience who knows how everything fits together and can fix everything is gonna make them more money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7) Let&#39;s talk about salary. Master&#39;s get an average of $10-20k more (but the same level). This is only peanuts more than a $180k&#43; starting salary for the level for undergrads, and a well-negotiated undergrad can easily start off with more than a master&#39;s. But don&#39;t forget, by the time the masters is entering, the undergrad with 1yr experience has been promoted to the next level and an average of $240k. The slightly-more-than-entry-undergrad $190k&#43; for the master&#39;s doesn&#39;t look too great compared to that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8) Let&#39;s talk about opportunity costs. Assuming you can save 50% of your after-tax salary, you&#39;ve put aside $70k the first year as an undergrad for investments. The next year with your promotion you&#39;re putting aside even more. That money grows fast (if you&#39;ve made judicious investments) and the master&#39;s can not catch up with $10-20k more salary per level. Not to mention the masters has to pay back their education costs, which are not trivial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, masters rarely get rewarded just for having a masters. It is a better money and career decision to go into industry and gain experience. Be the guy everyone with a masters asks for help from, and you&#39;ll get noticed and promoted pretty quick. Of course, a masters has much more value than a salary; the education is important, and you can gain some invaluable knowledge and insight from doing one. If that&#39;s your passion, no salary can make up for not pursuing it. But if as you say you don&#39;t care about that, then perhaps it is not so important for you.</p>", "created": "2020-10-15T10:19:44Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "history_size": 1, "id":

I don&#39;t think getting a masters will hurt job hunting, but it&#39;s 1-2 years of lost income and I have an internship at a big N company next summer that could potentially lead to a return offer and I would have to give up on that if I were to go to grad school. I heard working for a few years then going back to school for a masters in CS/MBA is also a way to raise career ceiling, but not sure how that compares to getting a masters right after college.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this or made a similar decision before? Thanks!</p>", "created": "2020-10-15T06:56:14Z", "subject": "Is getting a masters degree worth it?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kgagz51m9ho17o", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13365, "num_favorites": 17, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542305576, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3jrmnh6ia96x4", "name": "Sirinda W", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j23iq1bu44024m", "name": "Joshua Samuel", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j84vts9t9a719k", "name": "Vivek Datta", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgxautcc5he", "name": "Jonathan Luo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6laxtnshkh2dx", "name": "Daniel Sun", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrze20a4y4mq", "name": "Vanessa Lin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kaww3dlpw6n2fg": 1597045529}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpumlqaf2qb", "name": "Esther Cai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyt7k50bjzi368", "name": "April Sin", "photo": "1611264272_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jyt7k50bjzi368/1611264272_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpdlh77c2cg", "name": "Mridang Sheth", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j3jrmnh6ia96x4", "j23iq1bu44024m", "j84vts9t9a719k", "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "jktvgxautcc5he", "j6laxtnshkh2dx", "j3nrze20a4y4mq", "jzlnpumlqaf2qb", "jyt7k50bjzi368", "jzlnpdlh77c2cg"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 655}
