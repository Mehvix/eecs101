If you don&#39;t take 16A: don&#39;t use the 16a 2nd midterm as a way to learn op-amps, because you could do well on that midterm just memorizing some configurations and formulas.\u00a0 Instead, the op-amp <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">homeworks</span> in 16a are what actually give you the understanding that you need for 16b, so I recommend at the very least, doing the op-amp homeworks from 16a and asking friends for help.</p>\n<p>My personal take: I did well in math 54, ee16a, and physics 7a/7b but ee16b is just really fast paced with heavy problem sets, and you will be tested on seemingly small details from lecture.\u00a0 16B breezes through a lot of really algorithmic things very fast (converting to and from phasor domain, Bode plots, PCA, SVD, K-means, etc), and the exams are very nitty gritty and focus on dirty/tricky details within those algorithms (at least, during sp18).\u00a0 I would say that having the background from the 3 classes is helpful and really allows you to draw cool connections between different fields: 54 for the diffeq, 16a for the circuits, and 7a/7b for understanding the relationships between mechanical and electric oscillators, and understanding overdamping, underdamping, and critical damping. The way that these topics come together in 16b was a redeeming factor for an otherwise arduously difficult class.\u00a0 The 2nd half of 16b is slightly easier: k-means is very straightforward and was taught in 61a and things like SVD and PCA are definitely tricky at first but can be understood within a few hours of going through the algorithms and really ironing out the details.\u00a0 DFT is painfully hard but at least nobody else in my class understood it so i guess that&#39;s a plus.</p>\n<p>16B labs are simultaneously painful and cool.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for 70: I know that a lot of people talk about how terrifying it is and how brutal the psets/exams are, but it honestly depends on your comfortability solving really hard questions under time pressure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have math competition experience, such as being an AIME qualifier, then your problem solving skills and intuition are good enough for CS 70, regardless of how much of the material you know in advance.\u00a0 If your problem solving skills are strong, then you can focus on learning the material and can reasonably keep up with the class, even on the no-homework option.\u00a0 However, if you don&#39;t have the intuition and problem solving skills that comes from years of doing math competitions in high school, then even if you do the homework option in CS70 you&#39;ll be hard pressed to build that kind of intuition in just 1 semester.\u00a0 70 really boils down to knowing how to attack a problem from many different angles while still being efficient with your time: knowing the material is crucial but isn&#39;t everything to guarantee success.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2018-06-19T05:04:43Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-17T21:11:41Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Has anybody done this before?
