What I would say is, EE126/127 and Math 104 are the bread and butter of ML research (but you need to take CS70 before them), and taking all of them will help no matter which direction you want to go to. EE126/127 are full of ideas that are fundamental to a lot of ML, but Math 104 (and preferably H104) builds the mathematical maturity to be able to use the ideas effectively. However take CS188-189 since combined they provide a pretty good overview of the range of possible things you can do in ML (primarily 188 for the basics of RL), but understand that they are for breadth and exposure to the topic, rather than depth of understanding. From there, pick the sub-field that interests you the most, and then plan accordingly. If you want to do RL, start emailing professors about research positions and go through resources on the content on your own. If computer vision is something that interests you, CS182 along with signal processing courses in the EE department are the way to go. The caveat to this is that if you want to do Stat ML (some of the more traditional material that you&#39;d see in 189 for instance), you need to time things right since most graduate A/B courses happen on a fall-spring cycle. In addition, having Math 202A/B is really handy for mathematical maturity, and in conjunction with Stat 205A/B provides a rigorous foundation for thinking about probability and expectation (I remember the time where a page-long proof of a lemma in a paper simplified to 3 lines using measure theory), but the real courses you want to take are Stat 210A/B.
