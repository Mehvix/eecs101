There is a very high absolute quality bar that is applied for graduate students. This bar is not something that really varies by much across the department. However, in areas (like AI/ML) where there are lots of applicants that cross the very high quality bar, hard choices have to be made because there is limited faculty advising bandwidth. In general, these choices are made on the basis of &#34;fit&#34; and depend significantly on the specific mix of interests and needs of the faculty at the time admissions decisions are made. From the perspective of a student applicant, this can appear arbitrary, and to an extent, it is. After all, students&#39; underlying research interests and inclinations tend to be broad and flexible and a snapshot taken in a November application doesn&#39;t necessarily predict all that well what they really want to do the next September when they start working on potential\u00a0research projects. Oh well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That said, you should never apply to an area within which you would not want to do research. This means potentially\u00a0doing research with multiple faculty who associate with the area, not what you might think the area means based on its name. Similarly, you should never apply to an area within which you would not clearly demonstrate that you are\u00a0a candidate that meets the very high quality bar. (Talk to faculty in office hours if you want to get a sense for what that means on an area by area basis.) \u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-05-25T16:59:32Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j34nyjkos8k6p4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"idsclwixj9j35z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "name": "Garrett Thomas", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktwxnoaagy46y", "name": "Richard Liaw", "photo": "1462431487_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktwxnoaagy46y/1462431487_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idhrkbdw4mix7", "name": "Yirong Zhen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ijkj0mez6r218b": 1, "j3b97758y6d1tj": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijly8cfwGjP", "name": "Nader Namini", "photo": "1544211678_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ijly8cfwGjP/1544211678_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idriks20rqg42v", "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "hktwxnoaagy46y", "idhrkbdw4mix7", "ijly8cfwGjP"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-05-24T22:03:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-09T17:23:05Z", "subject": "CS program", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-09T17:22:51Z", "subject": "CS program", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-09T17:22:42Z", "subject": "CS program", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-05-26T16:54:39Z", "subject": "CS program", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-05-25T07:18:14Z", "subject": "CS program in Berkeley", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS phd program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-05-25T02:41:02Z", "subject": "CS phd program in Berkeley", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it true that getting into Berkeley AI/ML CS phd program is more competitive than less-popular-field CS program, like computational biology, graphics in Berkeley?\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-05-24T22:03:25Z", "subject": "CS phd program in Berkeley", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j33jdhmojxz625", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 4295, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552034233, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p73sapuj5vp", "name": "William Gan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p73sapuj5vp"], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 609}
