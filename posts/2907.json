Whole thing at once, or question by question with answer key?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From Prof. Sahai:</p>\n<p>1) The most important thing to remember is that everone is different in how they learn, but the most direct path to doing well on exams is to actually understand the material well, understand how it connects to everything else that you have learned, and to have sufficient practice with the underlying technical skills to be able to execute on demand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) For many students, getting adequate sleep and rest is extremely important. \u00a0Relatedly, the general ability to concentrate and not be distracted for three hours straight is really important. So, don&#39;t shoot yourself in the foot by going into sleep debt, not eating properly, or allowing yourself to cultivate habits of distraction. Being able to do one thing at a tiMaking your own me for a long time isn&#39;t something that will just work on exams when you&#39;ve spent all the time earlier in 3 minute work bursts interrupted by texts, youtube videos, etc... Marathoners don&#39;t train by just doing sprints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) Don&#39;t try to learn everything at the last minute. Really try to understand everything as the homeworks flow week by week. Don&#39;t just assume that you&#39;ll understand things better later. Ask the TAs and Profs for help earlier rather than later.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) In furtherance of your underlying understanding, the following approaches are woefully underused:</p>\n<ul><li>Making your own problems about the material, solving them, and sharing them with others.</li><li>It is often said that the best way to really learn something is to teach it. So, in general, doing versions of what the TAs and Profs do is a good idea. Make your own exam. Think about the concepts in the course, how they connect to other material in prereq courses and follow-on courses (ask your TAs or Prof if you do not understand this), and then try to make questions that hit those connections. After doing the practice exams as practice, deconstruct the problems and ask how you could make a similar question yourself?\u00a0</li><li>Pretend you are inside the material and understand how it fits together from the perspective of the computer or the math itself. Engage your artistic and imaginative side: try to escape the bounds of your individual human experience by stretching your ability to identify with the subject. \u00a0Don&#39;t be afraid to be silly. And don&#39;t be cynical --- every time you are cynical, you are just putting emotional distance between yourself and the material. That is not going to help you. The material has to become like a close friend --- you can get mad at it and frustrated at times, but you have to let yourself care and be vulnerable if you are going to really get close.</li><li>Play &#34;stump your friend&#34; with someone you care about and trust --- test each other about the material in a way that helps them understand better but don&#39;t destroy their confidence. If you end up stumping yourself, this is fine. Figure it out together. \u00a0</li><li>Don&#39;t be restricted to what you can see on the computer screen. Print stuff out and write stuff out by hand. Lay out the material in your own way so that it spatially spans many pages and you can see it all together spread out around you. The computer screen is too small to fully engage your visual memory.</li></ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2016-12-30T02:13:52Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Student posters, do you do old exams timed or untimed?
