The first third of 16a and 54 are basically the same, but the 16 series does go into circuits as well which means you wont learn all of 54 in the same semester.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 16 series is focused more on application than anything else. Everything taught is motivated by some problem of importance to an EECS major; most are still important to pure CS but this is an EE course. 16b does go much further beyond 54, to include many tools that people I&#39;ve talked to haven&#39;t learned until upper division courses. Many of these are really\u00a0pertinent to machine learning, while others are again more EE focused. They are all based in linear algebra in one way or another, however.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the addition of all this material in the 16 series and just overall how much they are trying to teach to a class targeted for incoming EECS freshmen with only a limited knowledge of some physics and calculus, it is much more high-paced and can have a lot of homework each week. The labs are also pretty cool and hands-on, but with lab and discussion that&#39;s an extra 5 hours of classes beyond lectures and actually going to discussion does affect a participation grade. Thankfully they are working on refining the courses as they only opened to freshmen F15/S16, so it might be better by the time you take it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So the choice is really an easier but boring and somewhat repetitive Math 54 and a somewhat intense 16a or a full year of the extremely intense 16 series that will actually show application and will definitely prepare you for future classes, research, and jobs.</p>", "created": "2016-07-03T11:18:08Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "iq6i7succ4y3nk", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijg8hgyu7yk1d9", "name": "Melissa Su", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguxwqmsgc1ic", "name": "Sirej Dua", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzcygshqgbv1a7", "name": "Benjamin Kha", "photo": "1500432344_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzcygshqgbv1a7/1500432344_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jg2f97tx1v13pa", "name": "Jingkang Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idriks20rqg42v", "ijg8hgyu7yk1d9", "icguxwqmsgc1ic", "hzcygshqgbv1a7", "jg2f97tx1v13pa"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-07-02T04:55:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Intended L&amp;S CS major who is not fond of math but enjoys hands-on learning.
