How are Cs170 and/or cs188 overall with respect to difficulty and workload, particularly under those professor&#39;s iterations, or just the courses overall if you didn&#39;t have them?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2.

I\u00a0understand\u00a0Data100 might be more manageable than\u00a0127 but as silly as it sounds I&#39;m only pushing data100 out one semester because after taking 61B with hug, I want to take as many more hug classes as possible with data100 and 186 later down the line.
