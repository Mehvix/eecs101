In addition to providing a stipend and round-trip travel expenses, we host presentations and group discussions on topics relevant to materials scientists, such as graduate school, careers in materials science, creating effective poster presentations, and management of intellectual property. At the conclusion of the program, the students present their individual research results at a poster session.

In addition to providing a stipend and round-trip travel expenses, we host presentations and group discussions on topics relevant to materials scientists, such as graduate school, careers in materials science, creating effective poster presentations, and management of intellectual property. At the conclusion of the program, the students present their individual research results at a poster session.
