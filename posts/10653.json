Might be smart just to not take another course so you can focus more on 61b and the GPA cutoff. Also guessing you&#39;re a junior transfer though since you already took cs70. Every CS upperdiv requires 61b or 61c, and every EE or EECS one requires 16ab, so you can&#39;t really do anything in department. If you aren&#39;t worried about breadth and really don&#39;t wanna just try out a course for fun or anything, Math 53 (multivar calculus) is useful and/or required for a lot of upper div mathy EECS courses like 189. If you&#39;ve already done that in community college, Math 110 would be a good class to take (assuming you&#39;ve done linear algebra before). ML math revolves around two main hemispheres: the probability/stats stuff in 126 and the linear algebra/limited calculus optimization problems of 127. Really getting down linear algebra in Math 110 will both knock out a math degree requirement and really solidify you math wise in EECS</p>", "created": "2019-11-02T02:02:28Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k2gx8wn4csb3r7", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/27 - 11/2", "bucket_order": 21, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-11-02T03:27:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k2h0a42srm15a", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>But if i take only EE16A and CS61B, what else can I take to meet the 13\u00a0 units (if I decide not to take math).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Thanks a Lot!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-11-02T03:27:23Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-30T19:50:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["faculty_advising", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi ,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I am currently taking cs70 and cs61A this semester and one American cultures .
