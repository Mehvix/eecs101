Internships are an opportunity to learn and grow in many ways :) If you&#39;ve taken my favorite course, and the most helpful for me, CS 61B, then you should definitely check out <em><strong>Cracking The Coding Interview</strong></em>\u00a0and if you enjoy that book and finish it(For the most part), start doing some\u00a0<a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">https://leetcode.com/</a>\u00a0. This will prepare you for interviews that you may have anytime after today! It can be really fun if you focus on learning and understanding that you&#39;re getting better after every problem (if you take the time to analyze, understand, and re-strategize your techniques).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of a structured thing like research or a startup, i&#39;m not sure! Maybe someone else does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think building projects from tutorials would be fun, as you said you&#39;re thinking of doing.(does Google Summer of Code have the deadline already?)

I do believe developing habits you define as healthy will be beneficial in terms of your academic and CS career is because you may become more productive, focused, and a better thinker. Maybe not, but I find that every awesome habit I develop, I grow stronger physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>IDK, sounds to me like you&#39;re going to, at the very least, get an internship next summer in which you will be super energized and excited for, then will be a beast and get another one junior year, and then you&#39;ll have offers senior year because you&#39;ll be proactive and work hard these next few years, and luck comes to everyone, but preparation can help with luck :)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6unggda5ox", "updated": "2019-04-05T08:30:37Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/7 - 4/13", "bucket_order": 50, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-07T03:08:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ju6ckh30jf61j6", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "If you are interested in working at a startup, cold email someone there with a personal message as to why that specific company is special to you.

I applied for internships, but I haven&#39;t had a very successful experience yet (cry....). But, I feel like as a freshman I lack the skills to work in a more professional setting both content-wise and otherwise. Yes, I could do some online courses on any CS topic I maybe interested in.
