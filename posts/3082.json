I would say that it&#39;s hard to say exactly which is better, but that both paths are fairly common. At least for upper division courses, transferring from being a TA as a different class is probably more common, just because there&#39;s more TAs for lower divs then there are readers for upper divs. What&#39;s more important is doing a good job of whatever job you took (so that you have a good recommendation from\u00a0the instructor).</p>", "created": "2017-01-10T04:13:11Z", "subject": "", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>This is subjective and depends on the course and the professor handling the hiring.
