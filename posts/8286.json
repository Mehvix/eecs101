I just had a small question that I was hoping some of my seniors who&#39;ve gone through these classes could answer for me. I&#39;m a freshman who&#39;s currently taking 61A, 16A, a Breadth, and a Decal (I took a very easy courseload since I was worried Berkeley would be too much for me coming in) and I feel that the workload is pretty stress-free. 16A p-sets are slightly long but everything else is pretty quickly done. For my grades, I&#39;m expecting an A- for 61A and an A for 16A. With that information, how would you consider the workload for taking 61B, 16B, and Math 1B? I&#39;m going to be pairing this with an R1A class to satisfy the L&amp;S requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One thing worth noting is that as an international student, my high school math class covered a lot of the material in 1B (such as integration\u00a0techniques and applications, diffeq, etc.) but there are gaps in my knowledge (such as series, specific proofs, etc.) which I am hoping to remedy.</p>", "created": "2018-11-28T20:04:17Z", "subject": "Would 61B, 16B, and Math 1B be manageable?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jp1lmcsic0x5w9", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8286, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547957808, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 318}
