My reasons are as follows. Others can append counterarguments or corroborations below.</p>\n<p>1. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about which professor would give better grades. I think you&#39;ll find that the distribution is pretty close. Just do your best. You can always use great services like CSM to help boost your understanding of the material to prepare for exams if you are concerned about that.</p>\n<p>2. I would not recommend taking 70 and 170 at the same time. There will certainly be others who disagree with this, but I firmly insist that if you do not have a solid background in mathematical and logical reasoning, 170 can be needlessly difficult. Given that you are concerned about difficulties in CS 70, it seems to me that you do not have the solid background and maturity needed for 170 (without taking 70 first). Of course, I intend no umbradge in saying this.3. More of an aside, getting into 170 as an undeclared student is not typically too hard, but it depends on the semester, and there are no guarantees whatsoever. I would not rely on your ability to get into 170 if you do not Phase I it.</p>", "created": "2016-04-10T05:24:08Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "imu4kzxm7e7f3", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "hov7n9mf6iu6lz": 1, "hxcg3tlkaxg5v7": 1, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "i5a4vj8vr4b6on": 1, "idjqdfip9c574h": 1, "ij9326ks6m87dw": 1, "ijkbb6gkyim6oc": 1, "jb5g5nd5ilu6zm": 1519500984, "jd9nm7v2drf4bz": 1524033535}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktxrml0e933lw", "name": "Alex Tseng", "photo": "1390250134_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktxrml0e933lw/1390250134_35.png", "role": "", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hktxrml0e933lw"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 4/10 - 4/16", "bucket_order": 211, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-04-10T07:18:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "imu8o056pts63w", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>1.

He is good. As far as Sahai is concerned, his problem sets are definitely way too long and time-consuming. I&#39;ve seen his style in 16A/B and have heard of it from my friends taking 70 with him in the past.
