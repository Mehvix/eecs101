The reserve caps are set differently for each class but for many classes, declared majors will be able to enroll directly into a CS class as long as there is space. (You can see what the reserve caps are at classes.berkeley.edu - details page for the class.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the event that you meet the reserve cap and there is no space in the class, you will be put on the wait list. Each day (at least twice but usually more), the system automatically checks for open seats in each class component and moves in people who meet the reserve cap requirements and who have selected components with open seats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Translation: In the example you are discussing above, the system will move declared majors in and undeclared majors will be bypassed on the wait list until their status changes to declared and they then meet the reserve cap requirement.
