Now going into my final year with the freedom to take classes I actually want to take, I want to make the most of it. The reason why I&#39;m trying to take cs189 while arguably having a shaky foundation is because I want to be able to take two courses before I graduate in the spring (i am talking about Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. They need cs189 as a prerequisite). So while I don&#39;t have the time to take these classes to prepare for this semester, I&#39;m thinking even if these courses won&#39;t have been taken in time to give a good foundation for 189, I am hoping they will provide one for the courses I will take in the spring.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "j3nrza1aae94l7", "updated": "2019-08-05T00:00:29Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 8/4 - 8/10", "bucket_order": 79, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-05T00:57:00Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jyxopwaff2u6k8", "subject": "<p>Did you even read the student response lol?

If it\u2019s the former one, yeah u can \u201csurvive\u201d. I once took CS61B(hilfinger) CS70 EECS126 and math 191 in one semester and went through that semester with average gpa 3.1. I think I \u201csurvived\u201d and built up some sort of mental toughness when encountering adversities. But I understand it might be a catastrophe for many students to have a C&#43; on the transcript for many future purposes(grad school, jobs, etc...) Based on your description, u already got strong willpower and mental toughness. So, I would suggest u now to spend more time building up foundations and knowledge. And then challenge the harder ones with ur mental toughness, I\u2019m sure you will gain more. For detailed suggestions, if u got plenty time, do stat140/eecs126 &#43; math110 first(also watch 3Blue1brown linear algebra intuition along the way, it might change your intuition about linear algebra forever!).
