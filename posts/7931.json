Does anyone have any experience with two very difficult finals so close together/advice on whether I should avoid this combination because of this? I would have taken 170 and EE 16A but they are at the same time and neither will offer alternate finals, and I think that 170 and 61C would be too difficult for me to handle. Any ideas would be appreciated because I kind of feel stuck in terms of my schedule, thanks very much!!!!</div>", "created": "2018-10-17T23:13:27Z", "subject": "Opinions on two finals with only 1 hour between them?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jndrvuvhznn2ui", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7931, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548360631, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4w0h8ra37l9", "name": "Amanda Schwartz", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jap5u4w7no91y1", "name": "Angela Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6d4w0h8ra37l9", "jap5u4w7no91y1"], "tags": ["eecs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 293}
