Projects are all done individually. Professor Sen has changed the course a lot so it is likely very different from past offerings (by both him and Hilfinger). It&#39;s still a pretty high workload, just not as high as 162 or probably previous iterations of this class/when Hilfinger teaches it from my understanding. The workload is more a lot of smaller projects and homeworks throughout the semester that have deadlines of between 1-2 weeks. Professor Sen has been good listening to student feedback on course pacing etc. so things might change a little for next semester.<br /><br />Compared to the other upper division classes I&#39;ve taken, definitely more workload than 188, 161, and 168, but less than 162. It&#39;s a little different than 162 though since 162 workload is concentrated in each of those big projects, while for this class there&#39;s always some work to do every week. Maybe around equal or a little less than 170.</p>", "created": "2017-04-11T09:58:31Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "j1ddjmsoieo6c3", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ijnk75cwrr325": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1m6am25m3q7", "name": "Alex Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzd1m6am25m3q7"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/9 - 4/15", "bucket_order": 154, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-11T17:14:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j1dt4f002jw63k", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thanks for the detailed response!
