However, the exams are pretty difficult overall. Much of the algorithms that you learn are hard to bash through with paper and pencil, so it is not viable to do too many iterations of calculation on an exam. They often ask deep conceptual questions about how exactly the methods work and their properties, so the exams are not trivial. However, I found the content to be very enjoyable and with this class, you could obstensively program very intricate AI for games. (not on AlphaGo level, but still pretty cool)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE127: This class has a similar workload to something like EE16A/B, the homeworks feels similar, but perhaps not as long, with an ipython notebook on every homework. The class was recently revamped, and I very much enjoyed how they restructured the course. I don&#39;t really know if the class will be webcast (this year it wasn&#39;t). This class doesn&#39;t have projects or labs, so the time commitment is probably overall lower than something like EE16A/B, but it depends on how you handle the homework. However, I would say that the linear algebra and methods that they teach you in this class are very important. It is a pretty good class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE126: This class is considered by many to be a top 1 EECS class at Berkeley. This class is also considered by many to be a top 1 most difficult EECS class at Berkeley. The workload to this class is around the same order of magnitude as CS70 weekly, but this all depends on your proficiency with probability distributions. There are both homeworks and labs for this course, so the amount of work can overwhelm people who aren&#39;t caught up on the subject. The exams sometimes have very interesting multi-featured distributions, so take that for what it is. The course is a very demanding and challenging course, but the course is well structured and important for EECS in general.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CS170: This class is very similar to CS70, although in my opinion, the homeworks are easier, but not a whole order of magnitude. Imagine if you have CS70, but they slapped a big programming project at the very end of the class. Same midterms and finals, same weekly homework, but now a project at the end too. Very interesting class and probably the second more important class for software engineering technical interviews at Berkeley, behind CS61B. The workload isn&#39;t that bad if you though that CS70 was doable.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-10-30T08:41:03Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvhgjq1t661g"}], "id": "k2d15xft22r723", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgoe0t1k57a", "name": "Kristy Lee", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jljmu83hBAP2", "name": "Andrew Lenz", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnq8erhow314", "name": "Fred Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvgoe0t1k57a", "jktvex6279x3zb", "jljmu83hBAP2", "jzlnq8erhow314"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/27 - 11/2", "bucket_order": 21, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-30T17:44:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k2dkkx3nmugo5", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thanks for the tips! :) If anyone can answer my other questions too that would be so helpful too</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-10-30T17:44:35Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-30T01:58:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Can anyone provide comparison for workload\u00a0for EE126, EE127, CS188, and also 170</p><br /><p>Taking CS70, CS61C, CS186 now, have taken all other lower divs. Not really inclined towards material taught in 61C.
