In fact, the spirit is very different. So, while they can conceivably help someone prepare for 16B in terms of circuit analysis skills assuming that person knows linear-algebra, there are no resources that really talk about circuits the way that 16A talks about circuits. This is because the pedagogic goals in 16A are different from a typical &#34;intro to circuits&#34; class. 16A isn&#39;t an &#34;intro to circuits&#34; class.

The downside of doing this is that one will have to self-study for the circuits portion of EE16A before venturing into EE16B. However, most of you (including the instructors) go on to say that there are numerous resources to aid in closing any knowledge gaps in the circuits portion of the class. So, my question is, can someone please post the link to said resources?\n\n(I&#39;ll be taking EE16A this fall, and I have neither Linear Algebra nor Circuit experience.
