I&#39;m not a fan of taking two courses whose lectures conflict.\u00a0 Generally, it&#39;s a bad idea (unless you *already have* a history of walking on water). You&#39;re likely to give neither course its fair due, and each of the two courses will reciprocate by not bringing you due benefit. Please pick one and proceed.\u00a0<br /><br /></div>\n<div>2. If you choose to take both courses against your better judgment and my advice, then know that I do not have a final exam in EE 120.\u00a0 Accordingly, a final exam conflict should not be on your worry list.\u00a0<br /><br /></div>\n<div>However, I do have in-class, lecture-time midterms and quizzes (likely three of each, and the quizzes might be pop). You do not want to miss lecture on those days.\u00a0 I will not burden my TAs---who, like you, are students---with extra hours of proctoring, just because some students knowingly take two courses that conflict in schedule.\u00a0<br /><br /></div>\n<div>3. I don&#39;t use a textbook for EE 120.\u00a0 It&#39;s not clear that I&#39;ll have funding from the Department to have the course on full Webcast. That makes it even more critical for students taking the course to be physically present in the classroom---not lost in Banach space---during lecture.\u00a0<br /><br /></div>\n<div>I won&#39;t stop anyone from cross-registering between CS 170 and EE 120 this fall. But, as I said, I won&#39;t burden my staff with extra work on account of students who choose to dive into a lecture-conflict situation.<br /><br /></div>\n<div>All the best to you in the final descent into the finals exams, on these final days of this fine semester.\u00a0<br /><br /></div>\n<div>Cheers,</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Babak.&#34;</div>", "created": "2018-04-18T15:41:49Z", "subject": "EE 120 and CS 170 Schedule Conflict in the Fall", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jg59m05bdwi3js", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6673, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549656577, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "enrollments", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 356}
