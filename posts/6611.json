I need a specific grade in 70 to declare and I might be able to pull it off, but in my quest to get this grade I&#39;ve started neglecting all of my other classes. I saw it early in EE16A and I decided to pass/no pass it, but I&#39;m still taking 54 for a letter grade. I don&#39;t think the content is all too challenging by any means, but I haven&#39;t been dedicating time to learn the material at all. \n\nHere&#39;s the thing. If I can&#39;t declare CS my backup was Math, but I would have to get a C or higher in 54 and then take 55 (another discrete math course) to do so. But before I give up I want to make sure I give it my all to do well in 70, so I&#39;ve decided not to spend anymore time on 54. Should I use my emergency drop on 54 or save it and take the F? I was sure that either way I would be able to retake the course for a better grade to contribute towards my math major, but I&#39;m already considering grad school and I don&#39;t know how bad that F will look even if I retake it.\n\nAnd another thing, how valuable is the emergency drop? I know we only get one, so would it be a waste to consider using it for this course?", "created": "2018-04-16T05:37:35Z", "subject": "Emergency Drop Math 54 or just take F", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jg1t59cj2rv66q", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6611, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549590434, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "policy", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 315}
