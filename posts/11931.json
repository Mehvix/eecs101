Clearly, it wasn&#39;t, since by this morning the class was closed, and I enrolled in the early afternoon. Now I probably won&#39;t get to take this class at all, since it&#39;s not currently listed as being offered next spring. If the department is going to offer a class with such tightly limited enrollment (and without some sort of application process, as Anon Scale suggested), the least they could do would be to offer it every semester to maximize the number of chances people have to take it. This is really disappointing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, @Anon Scale, it hadn&#39;t occurred to me to email anyone, but I think you have a really good point about needing some kind of application process to equalize enrollment opportunities a little, even if they still have restrictions in place like only students in their last year can take it, or sth (if they feel the need to narrow down the pool of applicants).

I doubt they are all seriously considering UI dev. or have done some UI stuff and actually could benefit from the course in this way. This is how a majority of CS DeCals run their enrollment process anyway, and some of them get hundreds of applications! The application wouldn&#39;t have to be long, perhaps a paragraph on why one is interested and a small portfolio demonstrating interest (some interface, digital/fine art, or other design samples) which don&#39;t have to be good but which at least show the student really wants the project experience and feedback from the course! It could at least dissuade the students who are not interested at all and just want it to take an easy course, and I know I personally would have several items to submit for such an application and I know for a fact that so many others would too. I have designed interfaces before but I am told the courses provides invaluable project and feedback experience, and I think I would benefit from it...
