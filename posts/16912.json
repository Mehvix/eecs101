Over the past two days they have been spending time over the Atlantic, moving south towards the Caribbean. Since there are no APRS stations over the ocean, we can only track them using the WSPR protocol, which has long range, but the position reporting is limited to 200 miles squared.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The balloons have very similar weight, and been launched from Cory Hall with a time difference of 20min. But weather is a chaotic system, and while the balloons so far have been maintaining similar, trajectory it looks like this is going to change.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>NU6XB-14, which was launched first is just north of the Dominican Republic, and is expected to catch the Jet stream east towards Africa and the Sahara desert.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>NU6XB-12 took a southern trajectory, and started circling a low pressure over the Bahams and was even seen heading west. This is an area with low wind at the moment, so it will stay around for a while and then start traveling north east on a very different trajectory than its twin.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>What is different this launched: Based on the experience the SF-HAB club had with these Chinese party balloons, we decided to follow a protocol to stress test the balloons before we launched them. The idea is to pressurize them at a relative pressure of 0.5PSI \u00a0for a week and identify balloons that fail. Out of 10 balloons we started with, we ended up with 6 at the end of the week. We hope this will increase the time we will be able to track them.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Here\u2019s the tracking link again:\u00a0https://aprs.fi/#!call=a%2FNU6XB-12%2Ca%2FNU6XB-11%2Ca%2FNU6XB-13%2Ca%2FNU6XB-14&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Below is a photo of the balloons being tested in Cory 403 lab.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More later!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u2014 Miki</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F500fc76b69d1cdd9806c60c83d5a7464dbd1914cdc7149adb7cee1704260c6ed%2FIMG_9784.HEIC\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fb91664d18f335d26a17aa944bd18c4735efce0cdefde4a8760d51fcd215e0cc5%2FIMG_9784.jpg\" width=\"1292\" height=\"727\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Prediction for NU6XB-12:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2F2872a0e9ff263c213ddb0f46d55c680788cb72bec76ce43d504d8ce83af84567%2FWSPR-NU6XB-12.png\" width=\"1084\" height=\"772\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div>NU6XB-14 prediction:\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fgxjgboc19oq5mz%2Fd0f8af13fbc7be539e64b699f7ed27e3161e41a325ddd244de532b70f48dfaf6%2FWSP-NU6XB-14.jpg\" width=\"1292\" height=\"710\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p></p>", "created": "2022-04-24T02:38:20Z", "subject": "EECS-Balloons update day 4: siblings are separating", "uid": "gxjgboc19oq5mz"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l2col3urgkz10r", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16912, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538402808, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "enrichment_opportunities", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 232}
