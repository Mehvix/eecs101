While they focus on elementary things, these in some way are much harder than anything during undergrad. Especially in mathematical areas, it&#39;s not hard to find freshmen already taking out all the graduate courses at MIT to begin with.\u00a0<br /><br /><br />Yes, this is also correlated with opportunities, smart parents, good social networking, and generally a feeling that &#34;it all started from the womb&#34;, but I guess that&#39;s just life. In terms of resources, a EECS 4.2/5.0 = 3.2/4.0 with just some research automatically qualifies someone for MIT&#39;s 5th year M.Eng program, which the vast majority of CS students do to improve their status for grad school, industry, etc. In terms of grading, I&#39;ve just over time found Berkeley&#39;s grading much more unnecessarily hard than it should be - MIT&#39;s piazza even had this statement in comparison:\u00a0<img src=\"https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyq0br1u3kx7dg/iah9ppdypmc2rr/ixjf0wme68ey/Capture.JPG\" /><br />In terms of GPA, if someone doesn&#39;t do well the first term, this already can make them stop trying (and this is a rational behavior - once you have a low gpa, there is barely any incentive to bandage your gpa compared to just trying to excel on other things). MIT has a P/F for freshman fall tailored exactly to protect against this, while we get slapped with a 2.7 average gpa for lower division courses which can easily ruin someone. I never particularly thought that someone accidentally stepping on an academic landmine implied that they were weak at all. MIT has a far bigger &#34;safety net&#34;; even internationally, universities such as Tsinghua in China have a special &#34;CS Yao Class&#34; designed specifically to get their students into top CS grad programs.\u00a0<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying these things to discourage people, but I think I had to post this to inform others just what they&#39;re dealing with and what they might be missing out on. \u00a0<br /><br /><br /></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_8", "updated": "2017-01-04T21:01:18Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-12-30T02:23:57Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Here is a person who got into MIT and Stanford for both undergrad and grad school, and got tenure at these schools.
