I can provide a bit more info on the relevant MCB classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>MCB 140 (General Genetics) - To build a\u00a0better understanding of human genetics, you can&#39;t do better than this class.\u00a0Along with teaching basic concepts in genomics, evolutionary genetics, and developmental genetics, this class covers current experimental techniques (RNASeq, ChIP-Seq, etc) that generate the large datasets you&#39;d be working with in computational genetics (which is\u00a0incredibly useful background knowledge to have).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>MCB C100A (Biophysical Chemistry) - After genetics, I think this is the second most useful class. It covers\u00a0thermodynamic/kinetic\u00a0concepts\u00a0related to protein, DNA, and RNA structure/function. This doesn&#39;t sound directly related to genetics, but I&#39;ve lost track of the number of times this class has felt relevant in my computational genomics research. Part of this is because understanding the impact of a genetic mutation requires some understanding of what the mutation\u00a0might do to the relevant protein. (Side note: it goes without saying this would be incredibly useful if you&#39;re interested in computational modeling of proteins for drug design, a la DE Shaw.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both classes require some basic biology background. If you haven&#39;t taken AP Bio or Bio 1A at Berkeley, I&#39;d brush up on your biology knowledge before jumping into either class (how chromosomes are inherited, the central dogma of molecular biology, etc - nothing too intense). MCB C100A requires some basic chemistry knowledge as well, so again, if you haven&#39;t taken AP Chem or Chem 1A at Berkeley, I&#39;d brush up on your chemistry knowledge.</p>", "created": "2017-11-01T16:59:46Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hzg2f9o3rqc6zz"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Nicole linked this about a year ago:\u00a0<a href=\"https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyq0br1u3kx7dg/icdxydvnk125h8/imm8fox9dtwb/Compbio_handout.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyq0br1u3kx7dg/icdxydvnk125h8/imm8fox9dtwb/Compbio_handout.pdf</a>.</p>", "created": "2017-10-31T20:17:36Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hccnzx9ezt97j7"}], "id": "j9g21poa85ina", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6pa28z3ss1b1", "name": "Keshav Rao", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewxunf4j306", "name": "Mahesh Murag", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is0qrusklvd21b", "name": "Sasha Yousefi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6pa28z3ss1b1", "j6lewxunf4j306", "is0qrusklvd21b"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/29 - 11/4", "bucket_order": 126, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-11-01T21:43:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j9hkjxawne3494", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Sweet, I&#39;m Public Health and CS and it&#39;s good to see there are some other combos out there that are interested in sorta the same stuff.

Great class.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m also really enjoying some Public Health graduate stats courses (PH245, PH241) which are basically centered around applying statistical methods (thankfully using a programming language) to PH datasets and deriving some intuition about what&#39;s going on. Ideally, I&#39;ll also be sticking around to take more during a 1 year masters in 2018-2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in Genetics at all, a good place to start is 150A followed by classes with Lisa Barcellos (<a href=\"http://sph.berkeley.edu/lisa-barcellos\">http://sph.berkeley.edu/lisa-barcellos</a>). She&#39;s one of the world experts in this field. Prof Marshall also seemed to be super cool and I really wanted to (though never got to) take classes with him as well (<a href=\"http://sph.berkeley.edu/john-marshall\">http://sph.berkeley.edu/john-marshall</a>).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#39;re interested in doing *research* in this sort of thing, I&#39;m part of a lab where I get to exercise both my PH and CS skills and it&#39;s been great.
