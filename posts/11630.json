Maybe you can even familiarize yourself with the syntax of some of the programming languages ahead of time like C. <br /><br />As far as content is concerned, they cover the same material more or less. They might, depending on time, cut out something minor...but for the most part you will be learning the same things as a regular semester. <br /><br />Sometimes the summer sessions cover more than the regular semester.
