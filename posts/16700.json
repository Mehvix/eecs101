I am planning on studying leetcode very intensively to find a really good swe internship for summer 2023. I plan to start applying for a ton of places at the end of the summer. There are about 4 months left until August.\n\nI already have a swe internship for this summer 2022, but I want to try SUPER HARD for a FAANG internship for summer 2023. So that once I graduate in Spring 2024 I&#39;ll hopefully have a job offer. My main intentions are to build coding and interview confidence. It&#39;s okay if I get rejected to a lot of places, because over time my confidence will improve and I&#39;ll be more prepared for applying for a full time job once I graduate.\n\nI&#39;m actually also taking a break this semester and will come back fall 2022, so I have quite a bit of time to dedicate to leetcode. \n\nI&#39;d love to find someone to do this with ! We could motivate each other and have fun in the process. Please email me if you&#39;re interested!! anhar07@berkeley.edu\n\np.s.\nI am really serious about this.
