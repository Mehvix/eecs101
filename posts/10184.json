Undergraduate Laboratory at Berkeley (ULAB) is a STEM education startup that gently introduces new students to research at Berkeley as well as provides a social/mentoring experience for advanced undergraduate researchers to learn from each other and develop professionally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ULAB is looking for mentors for their Data Science Lab to lead independent research projects for teams of freshman students. We are looking for students with a strong foundation in Data Science. A statistics, computer science, or data science background is preferred, and relevant research or project experience. Mentors will assist a small group of students in grasping fundamental concepts within the respective field and later on, help the students develop and carry out a complete research project over the course of the semester. Mentors should be willing to commit 4-5 hours per week. Specific work hours are flexible, and mentors can earn up to 2 P/NP upper-division EE/CS units.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more information regarding ULAB and applications, please visit the website at<a href=\"http://ulab.berkeley.edu/\"> ulab.berkeley.edu</a> or email inquiries to <a href=\"mailto:alanlp&#64;berkeley.edu\">alanlp&#64;berkeley.edu</a>.
