Usually cold emailing professor isn&#39;t super productive but certain research groups (primarily the RL people) are fine with this.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) Depends on the field, some look down on industry experience, some are neutral, and some encourage. If your gap is only 1-2 years between undergrad and grad it really doesn&#39;t matter but anything longer than that might start to affect your chances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) They&#39;ll look on consistent upward trends fairly favorably: this really depends on who&#39;s on the admissions committee but if you consistently get As in your last two years I think your first few years GPA is almost entirely irrelevant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) You can always try and do a combination of the two although I wouldn&#39;t know how you would achieve this in the two fields you are interested in. I will say you should just take the courses (i.e. 184 and 106) and then pick.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for a few additional points: if you are interested in applying to research based masters programs there isn&#39;t much to worry about and you&#39;ll probably get into somewhere. If you are applying to PhDs usually getting into top programs is very difficult unless you already are working in a lab and on track to publish a paper (or multiple) especially for robotics.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6gtkkw4sr227"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-07-26T15:31:37Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10976": 3, "4482": 2, "4673": 5, "4888": 0, "6974": 1, "7005": 9, "7230": 8, "8523": 4, "8787": 6, "9120": 7}}, "created": "2020-07-25T20:16:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello!
