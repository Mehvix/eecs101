They'll be discussing the first and final chapters (chapter 1 and chapter 8) of their book \"System Error: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot\"\n\nHere's the blurb from their book, which also describes the talk tomorrow: \"[the book] exposes the roots of our current predicament: how Big Tech\u2019s relentless focus on optimization reinforces discrimination, erodes privacy, displaces workers, and pollutes the information we get. This mindset prioritizes what companies care about over the values that we as a democratic society might choose to embrace. Even well-intentioned optimizers often fail at measuring what is truly meaningful, and when their creative disruptions achieve great scale, we find their agenda imposed on every part of our world. Armed with an understanding of how technologists think and exercise their power, three Stanford professors\u2014a philosopher *Rob Reich) working at the intersection of tech and ethics, the director of the undergraduate computer science program (Mehran Sahami) who was also an early Google engineer, and a political scientist (Jeremy Weinstein) who served under Barack Obama\u2014reveal how we can hold that power to account. Troubled by the values that permeate the university and Silicon Valley, these professors worked together to chart a new path forward, creating a popular course to transform how tomorrow\u2019s technologists might better approach their profession. Now, as the dominance of Big Tech becomes an explosive societal conundrum, they share their provocative insights and concrete solutions to help everyone understand what is happening, what is at stake, and what we can do to control technology instead of letting it control us.\"\n\nIf you're interested, come by Sibley Auditorium at 11 AM tomorrow, or join us on Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8114537715. \n\nChapters 1 and 8 of the book are also available on the CS195 website: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs195/sp22/</md>", "created": "2022-04-14T23:37:11Z", "subject": "Guest lecture in 195 tomorrow (11-12:30) Stanford Political Scientists Rob Reich &amp; Jeremy Weinstein", "uid": "hzd9m3irk83yj"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l1zn5h3ai2as", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": true, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 16775, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538553601, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ksjpf3xaz1qjt", "name": "Elam Day-Friedland", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbjuv006k3w6ya", "name": "Artem Tkachuk", "photo": "1643136803_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kbjuv006k3w6ya/1643136803_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kpmyg8co2qa4ox", "name": "Max", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ksjpf3xaz1qjt", "kbjuv006k3w6ya", "kpmyg8co2qa4ox", "jzqdhqjfxui43k"], "tags": ["enrichment_opportunities", "events", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 297}
