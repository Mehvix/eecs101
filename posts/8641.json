I was wondering\u00a0if\u00a0actually being declared rather than doing another major such as data science would make a big difference in getting the CS classes you want. Another option I have is to take CS 70, but I would have to get an A. I took it summer 2018 but had to drop because I did poorly on the second midterm.
