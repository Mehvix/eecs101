The only really prerequisite knowledge comes from Physics 7B, and the class is more or less a physics class with a lot of approximations made along the way. This class has by far the lowest workload of any of the classes you mentioned (it&#39;s probably the lowest workload class I have taken in EECS behind EE 147) and should definitely be taken at some point if you plan to design analog circuits. It also fulfills the EECS design requirement, despite its design project taking me less time than some labs in 140 and 151, so that could be another reason to take it. Also no lab!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>105 - Covers the core fundamentals from 130 (about a third to a half of the content, depending on the semester), except necessarily more poorly (in my opinion) since it doesn&#39;t take advantage of the band diagram model used in 130. This is kind of necessary since the class doesn&#39;t assume as much knowledge of the physics fundamentals, but can cause some confusion depending on whether you&#39;ve taken or are taking 130 when you take 105. The second half of the course focuses on single and multiple-stage amplifier designs using transistors and also covers the properties of non-ideal op-amps (this has been covered in the beginning of the course in previous semesters, but we switched it up this semester). Lab is a big part of this class (normally).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>140 - Analog integrated circuits, building off of what is taught in 105. This class gets you to the point where you can design an amplifier or two (and this is the final project in Prof. Muller&#39;s iteration of the course), and includes coverage of bandgap references and process variation at the end. 140 is really taught as 240A (it&#39;s crosslisted) -- it&#39;s slow in the beginning to get the grad students up to speed, and then zooms (tm) pretty unforgivingly into a brick wall at the end. I&#39;d recommend having taken 120 before 140 and taking 128 at the same time, if possible. I would say this was easily the hardest class I&#39;ve taken here, but 151 exists, so it&#39;s only the hardest class by a fine margin.

Used to be two separate classes, EE 141/241A and CS 150, but each of these courses was only moderately difficult and they covered relatively similar concepts, so the department decided to combine them to make instruction on the part of the professors (and literally nothing else) easier. The conceptual material isn&#39;t too taxing, and the only real prerequisite is 61C (although charge sharing from 16A, if that&#39;s still covered, and logic networks from 16B show up). You can take the ASIC version of the lab (from 141) or the FPGA version of the lab (from 150), but will need to design a pipelined RISC-V processor as your final project in either case. I will say that it was pretty cool to run C code on our design at the end of the class, but the work is quite tedious (I think my partner and I dedicated around 90 hours of work to the final project but my memory might be failing me). This is a really fantastic class to take if you&#39;d like to get an internship in industry though, and I found that the progression of the course material matched my interviews quite well.

Provides coverage of electronic noise (this is a big focus), switched-capacitor circuits (for gain stages, as opposed to filters -- those are covered in 240C, I believe), matching, and layout tricks. Also comparator design (sometimes). The material is relatively variable, due to the advanced level and different focuses of the professors that teach it. No lab! But there is an involved design project at the end...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>142 - RF integrated circuits. I haven&#39;t actually taken this one (since I haven&#39;t been given the opportunity), but the prerequisite material is 140 and 120-level signals knowledge. For a topical overview, I think the course description should suffice on the EECS website.

This class was once famous for its heavy workload and high degree of conceptual difficulty, before integrated circuits (and EE at large) fell out of vogue in this department. That is to say it&#39;s still really difficult, but no one will care if you complain about it these days (but you will have realized that by the time you&#39;re halfway though 105, let alone all these other classes).

I could go on about these classes as well (I&#39;ve taken all of them except 127), but that&#39;s more than enough to get you thinking critically about your career and life choices.
