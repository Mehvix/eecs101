If you still feel shaky on these topics, maybe try refreshing yourself on these topics and redoing the relevant assignments.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nadding on, I would say getting familiar with linux is a huge advantage (since 162 covers concepts that are heavily used in linux/unix operating systems). not a bad idea to try doing some systems programming on your own before hand, this may seem less accessible but there are plenty of resources to help you to dip into this. tmux/vim/gdb are all priceless tools to have in your arsenal for the projects. learning some surface-level x86 definitely would not hurt. basic ideas of how a program is compiled into a CPUs ISA and how it is executed from there (registers, PC, stack, heap) is crucial knowledge. also would not hurt to have a basic idea of what storage is and how it is different from memory. tbh, the best thing to do is fiddle around with your computer and start to learn how it works at its core. if you have a windows computer, get a hypervisor (like virtualbox, which is free) and install a virtual machine with ubuntu; this in itself is actually a really good experience for learning some os concepts. then just start coding in C; i don&#39;t mean coding in the sense that you&#39;re probably used to with python and java. start writing programs that do extremely basic things but interact with the machine at a low level. some  things to start with would be how to interact with files, memory management, and maybe even threads if you get there. don&#39;t just write the program, read up on exactly what is going on after you write the program and it is compiled and executed. \nhope this helps you get started, good luck! 162 was one of my favorite courses and it really helps you appreciate just how simple the building blocks of a computer are yet how intricate the system that runs them can be :)", "created": "2019-06-07T23:59:05Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;d say the most relevant topics from 61C for 162 were C, memory layout, virtual memory, and caches.
