You&#39;ll end up doing worse and worse in future classes like dominoes. Also, don&#39;t to PNP for 16A. You will miss out a lot for future classes if you choose to skip this. It&#39;s different from CC here, so don&#39;t expect to skim through the materials and learn them. Try not to finish everything so fast so you can optimize your upper div classes. If you do so, it&#39;ll just put you in a worse position.
