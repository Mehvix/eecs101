I focused on research and took other courses that were relevant to my research interests (control, optimization, math, statistics, machine learning).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was worried that this would adversely affect my application, but it worked out for me. I cannot speak for the admissions committees, so I am just speculating based on conversations with students/professors on the committees: I don&#39;t think not taking CS 170 was made a significant\u00a0difference in the decisions.
