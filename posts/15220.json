So, for me, it was either one or the other. When I applied as a senior undergrad, it felt risky to only apply to PhD programs, so I chose to just apply to the fifth year MS. In any case, at least at that point, I would have preferred to do a PhD at any of the other schools I was applying to. I was actually advised against this course of action by a professor, but I was proven correct by the time decisions came out.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) I think I can think of at least one person that applied to MS and PhD programs as a senior undergrad with the intention of leaving Berkeley. In that person&#39;s case, I think Berkeley ended up being the best option they were accepted to, so they did the fifth year MS and, by the time of the next fall, found that they wanted to continue on to a PhD. After applying to PhD programs, they were accepted to a few really good ones, and ended up going to one of those for their PhD. By that point, I think they had become aware that grad school (specifically the PhD) at Berkeley is very different from undergrad (I can confirm that it&#39;s a lot nicer), so the Berkeley PhD was their top choice, but I don&#39;t think that worked out (don&#39;t worry - the programs they were accepted at could be considered to be better in many ways, depending on your perspective).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve gone through it, I&#39;d say that the fifth year MS isn&#39;t that great of a program (it strangely has more requirements than the standard MS in the MS/PhD and gives you less time to complete them, for starters). But, in my opinion, a master&#39;s degree is only really worth a huge investment if it&#39;s going to completely shift your lifestyle or network. As an example, a CS graduate from say, Ohio State, would gain a lot from doing a 2-year MS at Stanford, since they&#39;d build a whole new network in California and probably encounter new challenges and perspectives. You could infer that a CS graduate from Berkeley might see less value in the same course of action.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since it was relatively (incredibly) inexpensive and only a stepping stone to me anyway, the fifth year MS was still worth it. I didn&#39;t like Berkeley very much as an undergrad, but most of my misgivings had to do with the culture surrounding CS here, and I&#39;ve been pursuing EE since I was a sophomore, so it wasn&#39;t like I was continuing doing something I don&#39;t like (or doing it somewhere I didn&#39;t feel appreciated or valued). There&#39;s simply a lot of stuff to learn in EE, so doing at least an MS is very normal and even doing a PhD and ending up in industry is normal as well, so perhaps read my advice with that in mind.
