We will first expand to allow more seniors to enroll; there will be no priority if you are graduating in the fall over the spring; it will go by waitlist order of seniors. We will add more seats to the EECS &amp; LSCS senior category on July 23. If you wait to add yourself until Phase II or after July 23, we may not know that you need the class and cannot prioritize you later so we recommend waitlisting now.

Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal.
