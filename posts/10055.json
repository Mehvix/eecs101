It&#39;s not misleading to just list your cumulative GPA (after all, they&#39;re hiring you as an individual, not just as an EE or CS machine), it&#39;s less misleading but longer to list both major and cumulative GPA, and it&#39;s downright deceptive to only list major and not mark it as your major GPA.
