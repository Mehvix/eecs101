Also, given that I&#39;m not planning on doing ML research in grad school, would 189 alone be sufficient, or should I also consider EE126/127? I know Prof. Sahai strongly recommends them to get a really in depth understanding of ML, but I&#39;m not necessarily looking to being an ML researcher. I&#39;m looking to apply ML to other areas that interest me (sports, music, etc).\n\nThanks!", "created": "2019-04-04T04:14:13Z", "subject": "Applied ML", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ju24lr3xa6o4kv", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8977, "num_favorites": 8, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547189250, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j54u3du5pgqn", "name": "Ethan Teo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0l2mxpm1h4tb", "name": "Dylan Hernandez", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5x7odf43ze772", "name": "Dhanush Patel", "photo": "1503736904_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j5x7odf43ze772/1503736904_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy39kz81ot21dm", "name": "Yudi Tan", "photo": "1485108893_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iy39kz81ot21dm/1485108893_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "name": "Shaantam Chawla", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4undmzeh69g", "name": "Shivin Devgon", "photo": "1553216198_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6d4undmzeh69g/1553216198_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j54u3du5pgqn", "iy0l2mxpm1h4tb", "j5x7odf43ze772", "iy39kz81ot21dm", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "j6d4undmzeh69g"], "tags": ["enrichment_opportunities", "faculty_advising", "lscs", "research", "student", "suggestion_box", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 472}
