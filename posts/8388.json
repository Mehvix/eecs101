I checked the &#34;Change of Major?&#34; option on the declaration page and submitted the <a href=\"https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/changing-majors\" target=\"_blank\">Major Declaration petition</a>\u00a0(with an MCB adviser&#39;s signature).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was this the correct thing to do? The wording for getting an adviser&#39;s signature is a bit confusing because some places say the signature is from the &#34;new major&#39;s&#34; adviser which suggests I should get a CS adviser&#39;s signature on the petition. Other places say to get a signature from your current major advisers. Also someone told me I should check &#34;Double Major&#34; and then include a note that I am switching majors in the &#34;Other&#34; box, but that&#39;s confusing too because of the &#34;Change Major?&#34; option (why else would there be a &#34;Change Major?&#34; option.....)</p>\n<p>Finally, I have completed about 60-70 units at Berkeley, but my transcript says ~110 units completed due to AP. The programming planning thing is mandatory for those who have completed &gt; 90 units at Berkeley (not including AP), but I&#39;m wondering whether advisers are able to see that I&#39;ve only completed 60-70 Berkeley units and therefore do not need to complete the program planning form.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-12-16T23:08:53Z", "subject": "Switching Majors", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jpri53kn6k46n4", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8388, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547764521, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["lscs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 410}
