I&#39;m planning on taking a few EECS courses my senior year and had some questions. First, I&#39;m interested in taking EE120 and EE C106A; 120 has EE16A/B listed as prereqs and C106A has 120 as a prereq. I haven&#39;t taken the 16 series but I am familiar with circuit design, linear algebra, Python, a bit of machine learning, dynamic systems and feedback having taken Math 54/110, CS61A, ME 132 (dynamic systems) and ME 100 (electronics for the internet of things), though none of these were heavily lab-based (ME 100 in Spring 2020 sadly had to cancel the project). My questions are:</p>\n<ul><li>If I enroll in EE120, will I be out of my depth since I did not take the 16 series? Or is my background a sufficient enough substitute?</li><li>Is it a viable option for me to skip EE16A and take 16B, if I decide to do so? I was also thinking about watching the lecture recordings from a previous 16A semester to ensure I&#39;m up to speed, even though I understand I&#39;ll be missing the lab component of the course, and homeworks, exams, etc.\u00a0</li><li>EE120 is pretty similar to ME132, some of the overlapping topics being LTI systems, transfer functions, frequency response, stability analysis, etc. If I decide not to take EE120 and take EE C106A (which EE120 is a prereq for), will I be out of my depth then? I have no problem reinforcing knowledge but I want to be wary about wasting time/taking a class that is too similar to ME132, but I&#39;m not really able to gauge this.</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you!!</p>", "created": "2020-07-16T23:19:24Z", "subject": "Questions about EECS courses and prereqs from interested MechE student", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "kcpf0z2qcpu1da", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 12693, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654543044850, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["eecs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 312}
