It also covers the background needed for digital signal processing (sampling, filtering etc).  And while most of 120 is background/theory, when I took it last semester, we did have one lab where we learned how to control a lunar rover (how to compensate for the signal delay to the moon).  Personally I&#39;d recommend 120, and if you find control cool, then EE/ME C128.  And for &#34;real world applications,&#34; systems and signals are everywhere, applications I can think of in addition to control: MRI, optical engineering, video/image processing (anything to do with DSP), communications, etc.", "created": "2017-01-03T23:17:50Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hzd1nlljlkv56f"}], "id": "ixi4y33x87z2tl", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idgojx8xjdn40y", "name": "Soroush Nasiriany", "photo": "1540146405_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idgojx8xjdn40y/1540146405_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["idgojx8xjdn40y"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-01-03T11:09:29Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>I&#39;m planning on doing robotics and AI in my career.
