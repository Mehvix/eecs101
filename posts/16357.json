Additionally, if you double-major then it&#39;s allowed for two upper divs to overlap between your majors, but if you&#39;re minoring, then only one upper div can overlap.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>See more here--</p>\n<p>http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/#minorrequirementstext</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2022-01-10T22:23:58Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jr9e54e6ayt2cx"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ky99594o3fd3m4", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"has_emails_sent": 1}, "created": "2022-01-10T18:52:56Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "policy", "faculty_advising", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "If I double major in cs major but cannot finish it by the time I graduate, can I switch the cs major to a minor?", "created": "2022-01-10T19:01:07Z", "subject": "Switch cs major to minor", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "If I declare cs major but cannot finish it by the time I graduate, can I switch the cs major to a minor?", "created": "2022-01-10T18:52:56Z", "subject": "Switch cs major to minor", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 2, "i_edits": [], "id": "ky91luqxd551zy", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16357, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539004793, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwupbl14eqmsc"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 310}
