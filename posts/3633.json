I think 127 is a harder course than 189, but remember that also depends on the teacher for the course. Most people I know take 189 before taking 127. (also note that 188 is largely unrelated to 126, 127, and 189.) 127 is more general than 189 -- machine learning uses convex optimization as an application.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>127 vs 126?

It is very competitive. It will take a substantial amount of time. The hws are weekly and take 10 hours each for me (not alone, with working with other students). if you have the time, go for it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have found all of these courses to be amazing.
