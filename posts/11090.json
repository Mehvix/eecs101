You have limited time for sure, but you also want to be able to declare. 16B takes a lot of time out of your schedule simply because the problem sets are insanely long. Some of the content can be difficult and require time to spend on it, though nowhere near the time I had to put into 70. Labs are much much longer than 16A labs. My partner and I (same partner for 16A and 16B) would be done with 16A labs in under 1.5 hours each time. For 16B, we never finished under 2 hours and pretty much every lab beyond the 2nd took the full 3 hours. And when you get to the car, sometimes we need extra time beyond the 3 hours, and that\u2019s time taken away from 70</div><div>Potentially.\u00a0<br /><div><br /></div><div>As the student answer says above, Data8 isn\u2019t really too bad though I can say it\u2019s gotten harder in recent semesters so just be careful not to treat it like a breadth. As I was taking practice Data8 exams in preparation for the midterm and final, I noticed each exam got harder as the semesters went on, including the actual exams I took this semester in the class. It\u2019s certainly easier if you\u2019ve done 61A (like I have) but the exams have become increasingly more stat heavy.\u00a0</div></div><div><br /></div><div>As to your question about getting the most out of each class. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to. Having 70, 16B, and data8, I don\u2019t think I was able to get out of 16B what that class has to offer. Same with some of the intro to ML in Data8 towards the end of the semester. All because of 70 the time I had to put into 70. But that is just for me, because I would say I\u2019m not mathematically mature for the kind of math 70 deals with.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>I don\u2019t know how easily you pick up things, so I can\u2019t say for you, but personally for me, I would say I\u2019m average and not one of the \u201csuper brilliant at probability and discrete math\u201d people. Meaning with 70, I would have to spend hours reading notes over and over again for something to finally stick in my brain. even with this, Homework\u2019s were still hard and I still always did below the mean on exams, but that\u2019s because I would say I don\u2019t have the mathematical maturity to do these exams. I ended with a B in 70 (the lowest I needed to declare).\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>However I know one person who did these 3 and did just fine with getting some form of A grade in all 3, but because they are able to understand things more quickly And more mathematically mature than I am. It all depends on person to person, and this could very well be you. Sorry for the ramble, just wanted to give as detailed of an opinion as I could.
