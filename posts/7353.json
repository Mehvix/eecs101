However, if you can handle the weekly problem sets in 170 (ranging from 4-10 hours based on your strength in math/proofs) and the problem sets in 54 (~2 hours each set iirc), you should be fine regardless of what class you choose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your focus right now is heavily on interviews and internships/jobs, I&#39;d highly recommend 186 over 168. From my own internship experience I have found that database knowledge is used more frequently in general SWE positions. I haven&#39;t really received an interview questions in either databases or networks, but I have gotten the vibe that databases knowledge is something that is generally expected while networks knowledge is more if your position requires heavy work with networks. Both topics can be self-learned, though, but if you want to take the more &#34;relevant&#34; course between the two, I&#39;d go for 186.</p>", "created": "2018-08-03T19:31:59Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Unless you are already very close to getting into 168 from the waitlist I doubt you will get in. 168 is about the Internet and design decisions and 186 is about databases.
