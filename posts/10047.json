If you&#39;re interested in the hardware side, the circuits series (EE 140/142, especially) would be great, and EE 120/123 might be useful if you&#39;re interested in the communication protocols that IoT devices use. If you&#39;re interested in firmware, you&#39;re right that EECS 149 is a good class to take.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE C106A/B is a great class series for getting into robotics, although depending on your recruiting timeline it might be hard to apply that knowledge in a timely fashion for job interviews. 106A is enough for entry-level robotics jobs, although it focuses more on the controls and software side, while 106B will definitely prepare you for more serious robotics software work. That said, 106A starts off slow, so if you plan to do job recruiting in the fall it might be hard to apply a great deal of what you&#39;ve learnt in job interviews.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both class paths are great and immediately applicable for various projects.
