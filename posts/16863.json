I&#39;m going to be taking cs70 this summer and hopefully declaring cs by the end of it but at the moment I&#39;m unable to enroll in my desired classes (despite having such an early-enrollment time) because of the recent changes in the cs department and it worries me as to what my class options are for the fall semester. Next semester I will be a senior and although I plan to take an extra semester, my time here at Berkeley is limited. Ideally, I would like to have taken cs61c, cs170, and another tech elective next fall semester but apart from not being allowed to enroll, at this point I&#39;m not even allowed to be waitlisted. Even after talking to an advisor (who also believes the situation to be unfair to transfer students), finding classes that I&#39;m able to enroll in was difficult, especially considering that even if I do declare, the likelihood of the classes being open is slim. What are my options for the fall semester? I understand that the CS department is under a lot of pressure but for students like me what can we do? Any advice would be appreciated.
