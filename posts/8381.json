I wasn&#39;t expecting to find the material that interesting, but Babak did a great job at teaching it and I actually enjoyed the class so much that I signed up to take EE 123 the following semester. (I believe Babak is teaching the class again next semester.) Babak&#39;s lectures were almost never boring and he\u00a0developed every topic very smoothly and carefully, probably because he&#39;s taught the class many times.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This class is different from EE 16A and 16B in that it&#39;s much more focused around a single progression of topics. The whole class is basically just learning six different transforms one after the other, plus some extra mathematical techniques that can also be viewed as extensions of the transforms. Homeworks were less frequent than 16A and 16B homeworks\u00a0(we ended up only having 6 over the whole semester) and\u00a0were also much more straightforward.</p>", "created": "2018-12-16T00:06:39Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I took 120 as a first-semester sophomore and it&#39;s by far one of the most important classes I&#39;ve taken.
