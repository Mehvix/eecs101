If neither of these sounds like you, 105 probably isn&#39;t the right choice. 151 will teach you how various digital circuits work using the &#34;transistor as a switch&#34; model, and this is invaluable for anyone who would go into computer architecture or need to design circuits for something like DSP (digital signal processing). It&#39;s a good class to take if you enjoyed learning about timing restrictions and processor design in 61C. 151 usually entails a whole lot more work than 105 (although some instructors for 105 do their best to compete), so 120 and 151 would probably be more than enough for one semester, while 120 and 105 could leave room for one or two other significant endeavors.</p>", "created": "2019-05-22T18:40:14Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj"}], "id": "jvzkocn6hj57d", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhopc26l6a8", "name": "Laiming Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jktvhopc26l6a8"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 5/19 - 5/25", "bucket_order": 44, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-22T20:53:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jvzpfxyt2lw7cd", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>To give a slightly more fleshed out answer to your last question, the answer is no.

That being said, around 95% of CS-inclined students would get far more out of 151 than 105, considering that FPGAs could feasibly show up in a software engineer&#39;s work, while analog circuits (or device physics) likely never would. 105 really is a class that only makes sense for EEs and MechEs, etc. (people that interact with analog or power electronics).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2019-05-22T20:53:40Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-22T10:46:22Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi!
