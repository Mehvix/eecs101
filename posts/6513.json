My favorite things about the course were that it didn&#39;t have a lab (you can&#39;t really make a star in lab, and astro undergrads aren&#39;t expected to know how to use simulation software) and that it was pretty well run. The problem sets can take a bit of time, and I do remember spending up to 15 hours on at least one, but considering that it&#39;s the only workload the class has to offer, I feel it&#39;s fair. The course material is admittedly all over the place, and it definitely is a physics class (read: not just regurgitating random facts about celestial bodies), but I thought it was easier than Physics 7B (admittedly, I really like physics, so factor that into your evaluation of this comment). There&#39;s also Astro 7B, which I&#39;ve heard is more interesting and doesn&#39;t require knowledge from 7A, so there&#39;s that, but that&#39;s also a physics class I believe.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2018-04-09T19:52:09Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-06T23:34:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am a rising Junior and would like to fulfill my natural science requirement in Fall 2018.</p>\n<p>I have taken Physics 7A and 7B but do not consider myself particularly strong in Physics, so I thought I would take a Chemistry course for the natural science requirement.\u00a0 Is Chemistry 1A the most reasonable alternative in terms of manageable workload and quality of teaching?\u00a0 I have only taken high school chemistry before.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insight, suggestions.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-04-06T23:34:39Z", "subject": "EECS Natural Science Requirement", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jfol7ugde74by", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6513, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549869084, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8zl3nphb8", "name": "Dominic Carrano", "photo": "1539468621_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p8zl3nphb8/1539468621_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p8zl3nphb8"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 250}
