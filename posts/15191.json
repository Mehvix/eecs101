Here is the advice that I would give to undergrads that want to get into research (feel free for other people to add on). Note that some of these are not mandatory, but just helpful for getting research. Now, these suggestions won't include the obligatory \"have research experience\" or \"know the professor personally\" because these aren't really relevant.\n1.  Get good grades. This might sound pretty obvious, but for freshmen or sophomores, if you can get a couple of A+'s in your intro courses and really show that you are kicking ass in these undergrad classes, some researchers will definitely show interest, even if you haven't done any kind of ML at all.\n2. Get to know your professors. Piggybacking off of the previous point, if you kickass as some class and show real engagement during lecture, discussion, and office hours, the professor might be more open to giving an undergraduate research.\n3. Show commitment to a project. Work on some project, any project, and show that you can push through and present some kind of progress or milestone. Plenty of student just have \"did research in blah or worked on blah\" on their resumes, but if you can show that you accomplished some goal (performance metric or result), this will show that you have the discipline to complete a project. Doesn't even have to be ML, just accomplishing a goal and showing progress is important. \n4. Show genuine interest in a specific field of ML. Plenty of applicants have some kind of vague interest in \"ML\", \"Deep Learning\", or \"AI\". For whomever you are emailing or applying to, show interest in the field that they are working on. Don't just be interested in CV, show interest in, for example, Domain adaptation for Image Segmentation or something. (This point is harder to accomplish, but at least being knowledgeable about a subfield could push you over the edge)\n5. Monkey skills. Some researchers just want cheap/free labor. Doesn't even have to be ML skills. Regular Web dev skills or systems or low-level programming are all very helpful and things that graduate students don't want to do. You might have to push through b*tch work for a couple of months, but after that, they might have a project lined up for you to contribute to in a more research related way\n6. Networking. Personally speaking, I didn't get my first research opportunity through cold emails. I ended up working for someone who got me recommended to my current research position. This also applies to other people I know got their positions because other people that they worked for (not necessarily in research) were able to vouch for them and get them past the interview. The power of networking is very strong. (Again, not the easiest point to accomplish, but it is important that whoever you work for is a gateway to other potential workplaces and positions)\n7. Cast a wide net. Apply to as many people as you can. Find professors, graduate students, research fellows, etc. and just start sending all of them emails. Remember, even if you have sent 100 emails, the people receiving the email will only see 1-2, so don't feel like you are spamming or are doing too much. Worst case scenario, your email is never read and no harm is done.\n\nAs for knowledge that people need to know for their labs, it varies lab to lab. Most likely, when you join a new lab, they will throw dozens of papers at you to read and a rabbit hole of papers and conferences and talks to explore. Yes, having some requisite knowledge of the field from classes or blogs or papers is helpful (If you don't know what a \"machine learning\" is, that might be a bit painful to get through the initial screen), but most people understand that to do actual research (even in a relatively newer field like ML), you need to basically learn multiple years of papers and achievements before you can even start contributing. You can definitely get research without being an expert in ML. TBH URAP isn't an optimal way to get research. That is for groups that have a project lined up for research specifically (to my understanding, someone can correct me if I am wrong here), but plenty of groups have ongoing projects or papers that one can contribute to without going through URAP. I just so happened to know all of the deep learning/ ML topics before getting research, but I know people who got research without taking 188/189/182.</md>", "created": "2021-05-28T21:16:04Z",
