I write updates in quotes because they are not updates, but are instead simply basic facts that should have been included from the get go. He makes these updates late. He tries to make his projects open-ended, and then tries to autograde them. I don&#39;t think he understands that the two do not go hand-in-hand.

And these weren&#39;t just typos or silly bug fixes, a majority of them were substantial clarifications. This is, unfortunately, not surprising to me.

He uses acronyms without telling you what they are. He has cyclic dependencies in his lectures. Everyone seems to be <em>enjoying</em>, but not <em>learning</em>. One metric that I&#39;ve found is a great indicator of the material covered in lecture, is the type of questions being asked on Piazza before the midterms. For Weaver&#39;s 161, an overwhelming majority (more than I&#39;ve <em>ever</em> seen) were on basic content. Typically, students will ask application-level questions near the midterms \u2013\u2013 those that arise from overthinking about things. For Weaver&#39;s 161, the questions were akin to &#34;What is DNSSEC?&#34; after we had 2 lectures on DNSSEC. (If you&#39;re taken 61B, this is equivalent to\u00a0<strong>many</strong> students on Piazza asking &#34;What is a HashMap?&#34; 1 day before the midterm.) That is not a good sign. I, too, was one of the students asking such questions, because after having watched his lectures \u2013\u2013 nothing actually made sense...\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some people really love him, but I strongly suspect these people either already have their foot in Computer Security and can easily follow Weaver&#39;s lectures because of that, or they just enjoy his jokes in lecture and don&#39;t actually realize that they aren&#39;t learning anything. There&#39;s a study often cited in CS370 and 375 that students walking out of a lecture feeling good\u00a0says absolutely nothing about whether they learnt anythingg from the lecture or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While I wouldn&#39;t advise not taking a course because a particular professor is teaching it, I advise that you, uh, <em>really, <strong>really,\u00a0</strong>make sure you <strong>actually\u00a0</strong>understand what&#39;s going on in the lectures.\u00a0</em>Just because he cracks a lot of jokes and you laugh a bit during the lecture does not mean you&#39;ve understood the content. Be critical and honest with yourself about what made sense to you and what didn&#39;t at a fundamental level. Fortunately, nothing taught in the course is so unique that you cannot find great alternate explanations online. :)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jygdh9ru1pd20a", "name": "Phillip Ly", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1615204162_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1615204162_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jygdh9ru1pd20a", "kaddqruc8a45kz"], "type": "followup", "uid": "icguxryosrt1fj", "updated": "2019-01-17T03:04:43Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 1/13 - 1/19", "bucket_order": 120, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-17T03:57:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jr0336x16m95nv", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "From my experience, I would suggest sorting down concepts in a separate note and do not rely solely on the slides for preparation of MTs and final.<div><br /></div><div>In case someone misses a lecture, better watch the webcast or read the slides before the next lecture, otherwise it will also be confusing.<br /><div><br /></div><div>DNSSEC was a headache for the TAs, too.
