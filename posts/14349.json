Here&#39;s what happened to me:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I started research with a prof in the summer and didn&#39;t ask about the 5th year master&#39;s until the school year began. By that time, they told me they had too many commitments to be able to advise another MS student. After that, I had to find research with another professor. This time around, I decided to tell the professors I contacted about wanting to do a 5th year master&#39;s. I was super fortunate to find a professor who has research interests that really excite me and speak to me, and if anything I think they really appreciated my motivation and determination by telling them straight at the start I was aiming for the 5th year program.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope this helps!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbtn7ezlne127x", "name": "Francis Geng", "photo": "1599171884_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kbtn7ezlne127x/1599171884_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh1jxe3fz32q", "name": "Tu (Alina) Trinh", "photo": "1613075743_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzdh1jxe3fz32q/1613075743_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeun1gdtx8tx", "name": "Brandon Suen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbtn7ezlne127x", "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "jzdh1jxe3fz32q", "kbeun1gdtx8tx"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-01-28T01:27:39Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"12221": 4, "12284": 6, "13049": 3, "13232": 5, "13429": 2, "13939": 8, "14045": 0, "1623": 1, "7119": 9, "8752": 7}}, "created": "2021-01-28T00:15:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["research"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>When is an appropriate time to ask if a professor can be your faculty advisor for the 5th year MS program?
