We seek to build a community of researchers of color. As research is an extremely isolating and exclusive process at this institution, we seek to dismantle this. Furthermore, students of color perform low rates of research at this research institution, alongside research programs on campus having low representation and acceptance rates of students of color. We exist to bridge this gap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">UROC events/workshops are open to the public (on or off campus) and held regularly, in order to be as accessible to a wider range of an audience as possible. Part of how we\u2019re cultivating this community is to provide students with necessary tools and resources \u2013 such as mentorship, panels/mixers, research methodology and decolonizing research workshops \u2013 for students to envision research that is relevant to their identities and communities with which they engage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please contact Istifaa (Co-Director) for syllabus and more details: iamistifa&#64;berkeley.edu</p>\n<h2>EdSurge and Blockchain in Education</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Link: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Berkeley-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/247357310/\">https://www.meetup.com/Berkeley-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/247357310/</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Title: Speaker Series: EdSurge and Blockchain in Education</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Location: The House</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Timing: Wednesday, February 7 6:30-9</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Description: In this meetup, EdSurge will talk with experts about how cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are beings explored and experimented with in higher education.
