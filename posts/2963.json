It&#39;s 1.5 hours or extra practice / concept review a week and you don&#39;t need to prepare or anything, just show up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But here&#39;s my other advice: read the notes, take note of the definitions (really those are important, there&#39;s no point of proving something if you don&#39;t know what exactly you&#39;re trying to prove), write down your questions as you get them when reading the notes. Question every statement in a proof and try to find the motivation behind doing things a certain way. If you can&#39;t find why you can make a statement or why something is done a certain way--bam, that&#39;s a question, write it down. Maybe eventually you can find the answers to those questions yourself, but the questions are a way of figuring out exactly what holes you have, and if you can&#39;t figure it out after a few hours on a note, ask a TA or a friend or on Piazza. If you don&#39;t know the exact definition of something, that&#39;s also a question. Write down the definition you don&#39;t know, look it up, then write down the definition, then memorize it. You should know definitions cold. Don&#39;t take too many other hard classes if you don&#39;t have much of a math background---intuition (which is basically &#34;mathematical maturity&#34;) is very helpful and is built up by just spending a lot of time on math.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think that Alvin Wan (the head TA) and others have written their own resources to help you. There&#39;s lots of midterm practice stuff. So for test practice / resources you&#39;re basically set--you&#39;re probably not going to run out of practice. On the more conceptual side, I&#39;m writing something along the lines of &#34;70, but in English, so for people who don&#39;t have that much math experience,&#34; but it&#39;s taking fairly long.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also if you don&#39;t enjoy math, I hope you can come into 70 with an open mind; it&#39;s most likely different from any math class you&#39;ve previously taken. Maybe 70 will change your mind about math---I truly hope you&#39;ll maybe see parts of it as neat or cool or, dare I say, beautiful.\u00a0I<em>\u00a0</em>think it&#39;s beautiful, but past that, CS in general is a lot of math and you might find some future classes more enjoyable (or less distateful, whichever you want) if you like math. I understand if you don&#39;t like it still though.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>...I hope this was helpful or will be to someone, because it&#39;d be a little embarrassing to have written this much and for it not to be helpful.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I wish you the very best of luck!\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2016-12-31T04:46:30Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/25 - 12/31", "bucket_order": 170, "children": [{"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 12/25 - 12/31", "bucket_order": 170, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-12-31T18:58:00Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ixdlcdfj5pk5n0", "subject": "<p>^ This is very important.

If you give up, you enter into a positive feedback cycle where you think you can&#39;t do it, so you fall behind, and then you really can&#39;t do it, which makes you fall behind further.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There have been a variety of different answers that have all worked for the people who posted them. My own take on it is that for CS 70, you really need to be comfortable with the material. It&#39;s not quite like 61A or 61B or 61C where a lot of what you learn is just\u00a0how some aspect of a computer works. With 70, you&#39;ll be building on the mathematical foundation you already have and you&#39;ll be using just about all of it. You need to creatively use what skills you have in order to solve CS 70\u00a0problems. The only way to get to that level of comfort is to sit down with the material and think about it. The way I gauged my comfort level with the material was seeing if I could build back up to a topic from first principles. For example,</p>\n<p>&#34;How does secret sharing work?&#34;</p>\n<p>&#34;You distribute your secret as points on a polynomial.&#34;</p>\n<p>&#34;Why do you do that?&#34;</p>\n<p>&#34;Because n points define a degree n-1 polynomial uniquely. There are an infinite number of ways to construct a degree n-1 polynomial with only n-1 points.&#34;</p>\n<p>&#34;I guess that means if you take a degree n-1 polynomial, make the secret $$P(0)$$ and give a unique point on that polynomial to each of n unique people, then that group of n people wouldn&#39;t be able to reconstruct the polynomial unless they all come together.\u00a0Without reconstructing the polynomial, there&#39;s no way they can access the secret at $$P(0)$$, so it&#39;s safe.&#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, first principles depends on your mathematical background. Maybe you&#39;d need to go a step further or a step less than I did, but the point is that you should understand exactly what each topic is doing and why it works. With some topics, you might need some more practice to get more comfortable with it, like counting or random variables. Regardless, this method worked well for me in 70 and should get you more than just a B&#43; if you follow through.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was a TA for 70 one semester if that&#39;s important.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "hktxrgkow7l38w", "updated": "2017-01-01T22:33:17Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-12-30T21:31:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs", "cs-intended"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>I don&#39;t particularly enjoy math but I want to be declared.
