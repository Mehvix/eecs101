Study abroad with a community college. Just enroll, anyone can do it. You can do it now, when you&#39;re 50, 60, 70, 100, etc. This works because anyone can enroll in community college.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. During a summer freshman/sophomore/junior year, go take a 2-3 month trip and stay in hostels/airbnbs. I don&#39;t like hostels, but some people do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. After graduation, go travel in the summer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. During winter breaks, travel for the month.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you plan on &#34;studying abroad&#34; without the formal program, I have a few suggestions:</p>\n<p>a. There is something magical about living in the same place for 2-3 months, and that&#39;s the only reason why I think study abroad is a good idea. If you want to see the world, go travel to many cities in a short amount of time. If you want to live and breathe a different culture and have a place in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia etc be a new home to you, stay in an airbnb/hostel for 1 month at least. The issue is that this can get lonely if you&#39;re not put into some kind of forced socialized environment, which is why study abroad formal programs are nice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>b. If you plan on visiting a ton of cities, spend at least 3 days, and 5 is better. Cost goes up, you&#39;ll see less cities, but you&#39;ll experience each one more. I personally like walking around aimlessly and getting lost until I develop the entire map of the centralized parts within a city in my head. This means I can visualize how to get anywhere within a city from each turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>c. I&#39;m very content with traveling alone, but it&#39;s not for everyone. People get lonely, scared, and bored. In addition, some people, like myself, don&#39;t like traveling with people. I suggest traveling to a local city on your own for a week, and going to another local city with friends, and seeing which you prefer. Then you can plan your 2-3 month trip.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>d. Life is a long game. You don&#39;t have to see the world by the time you graduate. You don&#39;t even have to see the world. Just take it step by step, and visualize where you want to go and try to make it happen without losing other aspects of your life(job, savings, etc).</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jyq487ctcwuk8": 1570760427}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzccssa5qo462l", "name": "Hari Vallabhaneni", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzccssa5qo462l"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6unggda5ox", "updated": "2018-09-21T21:33:59Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/23 - 9/29", "bucket_order": 140, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 9/23 - 9/29", "bucket_order": 140, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-09-25T20:23:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jmi64rm7b5ig2", "subject": "<p>It&#39;s very similar to a career fair in that all the different programs/orgs have tables and you can visit the ones you are interested in.

You already have three or four years (or more, if graduate school is in the cards) to do just that. You study abroad to gain perspective, to ask yourself &#39;where do I fit in in this world?&#39; To learn other lifestyles. To learn a new language. To develop an identity outside of the academic one that you&#39;ve known for the last decade of your life. To develop into your own independent person apart from things and people you&#39;ve known.&#34;\u00a0 -\u00a0</em>Yuan Yuan,\u00a0CS B.A. 2017.
