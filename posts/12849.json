That being said, there is review of 61c at the beginning of 162 and again when memory material comes up, but if you didnt do so well in 61c and dropped the course, I would really recommend finishing that course, or at least becoming really comfortable with C and the memory unit parts of 61c. 162 is also incredibly high workload, and this is coming from someone who is about average at C coding and debugging.

But hopefully we&#39;ll do better in following semesters. \n\nSo back to the question, with the heavy workload of CS 162, I wouldn&#39;t recommend you taking it with another class formatted in a similar way, like CS 61C. From my personal experience, 162 is at least 2-3x as heavy as 61C. Also as Neil mentioned, it requires a lot of understanding of concepts about computer hardware and low level programming. Those are strictly related to what you learn in 61C.\n\nMy suggestion is, don&#39;t rush it, retake 61C whenever you feel ready, then take CS 162 in a following semester. Also if you&#39;re taking 162, try not to take more than 2 CS courses at the same time, even for a regular semester. And don&#39;t take it in summer. That hurts both your GPA and your mental health. Taking 61C with classes like CS 70 or 169 sounds good for me. Also, part of 161 is about C programming so you&#39;ll need the knowledge from 61C. After that you can consider taking CS 162, and other more advanced courses. If you want to take a break from the mess of 61C, that&#39;s also fine.
