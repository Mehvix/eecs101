You also decrease the amount of summers you get to try an internship by rushing, and this means you don&#39;t get as many chances sampling companies/figuring out your ideal career! And don&#39;t underestimate\u00a0the possibility of changing your mind throughout this process, being open and flexible is a good thing. My first year, I wanted to graduate early as well, and took summer courses for this reason, but recently I found an interesting application of my CS degree in another academic field and I plan to double major, take 9 semesters,\u00a0have time for research and getting to know people here, etc. My story/advice is not that important, but keep in mind you are studying CS and that means you can probably afford to enjoy school a little longer if you want to (: Lastly, consider the idea of doing your masters outside of Berkeley--it may not be likely, considering Berkeley is a top CS school, but you may find yourself wanting a change of scenery at some point.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-10-21T01:06:09Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-26T10:44:23Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>If you want ML, you need to know at least some multivariable calculus.

You can gain so much more background that will help you whether you go industry or grad school, and you can find classes you might find more enjoyable. Going for grad school especially, you just weaken your application by graduating early (less time for classes and research). Also be wary of taking more than 3 techs a semester, but you know yourself better than I do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Idk how much it matters for 5th years masters, but it helps for grad school in general to have taken a grad class, so maybe add one it (but needs to be on application when you apply, so if you apply out of college, needs to at least be taken that fall).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, it helps to cover the core stuff you wanna do as soon as possible (eg 189) before the more specialized stuff (eg info 159). 189 can help you get stuff in ML in general, but 159 only helps with NLP, so you get more options that way. Like for me I did that with the AI courses and that let me get research opportunities to help for grad school, while someone else prob took 162 and such early and got some great internships early on (not that you cant get both). You could also move stuff like 186 and 154 to your final semester to help with your goal.

If you find yourself liking any particular areas within AI/ML/DS, feel free to dive in there while still in undergrad.
