Taking both 126 and 127 right now, I will say that your concern\u00a0or lack of confidence\u00a0will probably be reflected when you take those classes. I have only taken 16A and 54 for linear algebra, and I&#39;m pretty sure 16A and 16B are the bare minimum for you to barely feel comfortable going through 127. 126 and 127\u00a0definitely rely on strong past knowledge, unlike\u00a0170. 170 teaches you more about thinking as opposed to\u00a0strengthening\u00a0past knowledge and seeing them from an applicational perspective. I&#39;ve noticed that cs170 staffs are much more friendly to &#34;stupid questions&#34; but in classes like 126 and 127, professors expect people to\u00a0be really comfortable\u00a0in the first 2 weeks of review lecture and most questions were not encouraged.

I want to take either 2 or 3 of these courses next semester. I only need 2 to graduate, so I can P/NP 1 if I take 3. If I take 2, I might have more time to join Software Consulting clubs. Nevertheless, general consensus is to take 162. Here are reasons why I want to take each course:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>a. 162 = Understanding OS and inner workings of Computer while getting to work on big projects. Although I might be able to self study 162 with 186, 61c, and 168 experience.</p>\n<p>b. 161 = I don&#39;t know anything about Security</p>\n<p>c. 126 &#43; 127 = My linear algebra and probability/stats skills are terrible. I forgot math 54, and my only other linear algebra experience is 16A. In addition, my only probability/stats is from Data 100 and a few weeks of CS 70. These courses will allow me the ability to self study ML. However, with my lack of familiarity with the content, i&#39;ll probably spend a ton of time on these classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I had to choose today, i&#39;d probably go with 162 &#43; 161, but I think the better choice would be 126 and 127 since i&#39;ll have a better\u00a0experience self studying 162 and 161.</p>", "created": "2018-09-10T15:48:24Z", "subject": "162 &#43; 161 &#43; 126 &#43; 127", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jlwgp02hz5wku", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7604, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548626452, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "eecs", "faculty_advising", "lscs", "peer_directed", "student", "tutoring", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 343}
