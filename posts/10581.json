While I agree that there&#39;s plenty of overlap between the machine learning portion of data 100 and 189, there is no part of either 189/140 where you will learn about things like regex, data cleaning, Eda, visualisation, pandas, or the data science life cycle. Additionally, given that data 100 devotes more time to linear and logistic regression than 189 does, it&#39;s reasonable to say it introduces a more robust foundation to these topics than 189 in at least some regards</p>", "created": "2019-10-27T18:39:16Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6ij45p75m92r7"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Given a good background in EECS16AB, STAT140, CS70, CS61A, you are well prepared for\u00a0Shewchuk&#39;s 189.
