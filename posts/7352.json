I know according to the policy of L&amp;S, I have 5 semesters to finish my double major course requirement. But for now, my schedule looks very tight and fixed. If anything goes wrong with my schedule in the future(like course conflict), I may not be able to finish both majors in the worst scenario. So, I wonder is it possible to be granted an extra semester(6th)? I have decided to see L&amp;S advisor discussing this issue. But I hope I could get some opinions from students who may have the same experiences or who know someone once successfully got the 6th semester.
