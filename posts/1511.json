I personally think unity is easier to begin with. There is a lot of documentation and answers to common problem on forums. It uses C# which is generally easier to use and quicker to get something up and running with. If you&#39;re computer is a bit slow, Unity also runs better on slower machines. Unreal does have blueprints though, which allow you to create something with very little code, or sometimes even without any. (I haven&#39;t really used unreal too much, so if anyone else has experience please chime in)</p>\n<p>2. Unity has very simple multiplatform deployment. You can even deploy it to play on the web without any downloading required (except the unity plugin). I have heard that Unreal&#39;s use of C&#43;&#43; is riddled with unconventional form/use of the language. I&#39;ve heard it referred to as Unreal Script rather than C&#43;&#43;. Graphically\u00a0I believe Unreal looks better out of the box, but Unity can look just as good. I feel that Unity is also more widely used in the industry, especially for indie games. Talked to some developers at GDC and didn&#39;t come across any indie developer who used unreal. All of them used either Unity or their own engines. There are, however, some very big ticket games that have been made with unreal (ex. Bioshock Infinite).</p>\n<p>3. I don&#39;t believe we get full Unity access. (Don&#39;t quote me on that)</p>\n<p>4. I recommend just doing a couple of tutorials on the Unity website:\u00a0<a href=\"https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials\">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials</a>\u00a0Don&#39;t get lost doing only tutorials though. I&#39;d do a couple just to get more familiar with the interface and the API. Try to make some small (read: very small) games and refer to either tutorials or forums for help. Importing assets\u00a0like sound, music, art, animations, etc. has been really easy with unity. Most of it is just a simple drag and drop with maybe a quick reference in a script.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feel free to find me on facebook and msg me or email me if you&#39;d like to chat more about Unity/game development. I&#39;m currently also trying to learn these things, so I am, by no means, an expert. Also keep in mind that all of my answers are probably biased due to the fact that I really haven&#39;t used unreal very much. They mainly came from my own research when trying to decide on which one to use as well.</p>", "created": "2016-05-18T21:43:41Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i50car1hs4v366"}], "id": "iodeb31ljbx2ye", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"idj0i2vuu8x222": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktwxobua7547n", "name": "Mike Ambrose", "photo": "1484676769_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktwxobua7547n/1484676769_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzogwzmgKSk", "name": "BRIAN LEE", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i54n6vz2munp0", "name": "Steven Ho", "photo": "1504627229_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/i54n6vz2munp0/1504627229_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ij3pfeuht2js", "name": "Kachi Onyeador", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hktwxobua7547n", "hzogwzmgKSk", "i54n6vz2munp0", "idriks20rqg42v", "j6ij3pfeuht2js"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-05-18T10:57:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>Hi, random CS guy here.</p>\n<p>Wanted to try out some elementary game development, so I had some questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1.
