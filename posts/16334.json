Luckily someone already did and this was the response yesterday:\n> Stat 20 will remain a viable alternative to Data C8 as a prerequisite for Data C100 moving forward. However, Stat 20 is not approved to substitute for Data 8 toward the major requirements if taken after Spring 2022. If you wish to declare the Data Science major (or minor) and have not already taken Stat 20, you should plan to take Data C8. If you do not plan to declare the Data Science major or minor but simply want to enroll in Data C100, Stat 20 is fine.\n> - by\u00a0Laura Imai\u00a0and\u00a0Aaron Giacosa\n\nSo you should be fine to enroll for any semester.\n\nNot answering in student's answer though as idk about EECS technical requirements (though maybe @10288 will help, in any case data 100 is a great class with an awesome course staff. I would suggest taking it even if it doesn't satisfy degree reqs -- though i also understand not everyone has the liberty to take courses if they don't satisfy degree reqs due to lack of time).</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kae5mj1snlw61y", "name": "Sharvil Trifale", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kae5mj1snlw61y"], "type": "followup", "uid": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "updated": "2022-01-08T13:43:25Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2022-01-09T09:15:09Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>Rahul has already answered your question regarding stat 20 being used in place of data 8 for the data 100 prereq.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The answer to your second question is yes</p>", "created": "2022-01-09T09:15:09Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6ij45p75m92r7"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ky71iytfkj54j", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kae5mj1snlw61y", "name": "Sharvil Trifale", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1640498621_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1640498621_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["kae5mj1snlw61y", "kaddqruc8a45kz"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2022-01-10T02:50:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ky8381nxm6c4sa", "subject": "<p>Ishaan was on Data 100 staff so he would know better than me (so was Suraj who I linked in the above followup but given that I&#39;m L&amp;S and not EECS, I was not sure if what Suraj said was relevant to your question as idk how EECS reqs works).
