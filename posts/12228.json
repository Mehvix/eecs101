Examples we talked about in class were the computers in parking garage gates, RC drones, security cameras, etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since this is Berkeley, the way that EECS 149 covers this subject is very theoretical. When I took this class, we spent a lot of time on the theory of finite state machines (turns out they can be done a lot more rigorously than in CS 61C and EECS 151). We also covered some operating systems and networking concepts at a high level, although not as in-depth as CS 162 or 168 would go.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most people who take EECS 149 don&#39;t do it for the lecture content, but rather for the labs and project. The labs in 149 will give you a taste of what programming a microcontroller without a lot of helpful abstractions is like, and also have you do some tasks with wheeled robots that are a bit like the EE 16B car, but less frustrating. For the project, you can essentially choose anything you want that is somewhat related to embedded systems, but if you use hardware/software frameworks from the previous labs it will be easier for the course staff to help you. For what it&#39;s worth, I found the 149 project to be one of my favorite things that I worked on in college.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The course was retooled as of Fall 2018 and so those slides you&#39;re looking at may not be the best resource. In my opinion, looking at the lab descriptions / past final projects from Fall 2018/2019 is probably the best way to see if the course is for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t describe the course as really covering digital/analog connections. Although the idea of measuring analog inputs is covered at some point, it&#39;s all very theoretical. You may need to learn a bit about analog-to-digital conversion and vice versa for your project, depending on what you decide to do. If you&#39;re really interested in digital/analog connections, maybe consider taking EE 120/123, or EE 140 when Prof. Pister teaches it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, in regards to how 149 relates to 162, I think that 149 is a much gentler introduction to some of the same topics covered in 162. 162 expects you to already be comfortable programming in C, even though you can make it through CS 61C without ever really reaching that level of comfort. If you take 149 in between, the labs and project should make you a lot better at programming in C without the pace of 162. Additionally, topics like scheduling, interrupt handling, and networking from 149 will show up again in 162, and you might appreciate already having studied them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this was helpful!</p>", "created": "2020-05-12T03:09:24Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "ka3c6jsyza31i0", "is_tag_endorse": true, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6l0q8u46ag7a4", "name": "Shiyun Jimmy Xu", "photo": "1503727904_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6l0q8u46ag7a4/1503727904_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jc88lkur5zo23j", "name": "Gregory Jerian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnp0wt88i22b", "name": "Simon Guo", "photo": "1580315354_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnp0wt88i22b/1580315354_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "name": "Shaantam Chawla", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdiskhawg4q7", "name": "Aniruddh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kpmyg8co2qa4ox", "name": "Max", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6gtkkw4sr227", "jktvex6279x3zb", "j6l0q8u46ag7a4", "jc88lkur5zo23j", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "jzlnp0wt88i22b", "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "jzqdiskhawg4q7", "kpmyg8co2qa4ox"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/10 - 5/16", "bucket_order": 77, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 5/10 - 5/16", "bucket_order": 77, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-13T02:02:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ka4p8smhhqlbs", "subject": "<p>In Fall 2018, the workload came from problem sets, labs, and the final project.
