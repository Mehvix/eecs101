I understand the new format for the enrollment that we need to form a group beforehand. I have already found a group of 5. However, only three members are CS/EECS and two members are\u00a0CogSci and CS minor. I&#39;m not sure how this work since on the website it specifically restricted to CS/EECS. Does that mean you can&#39;t form a group who are not CS/EECS major? If we end up forming the group with Non-CS/Non-EECS, can we still get into the class?</p>", "created": "2016-04-14T18:21:00Z", "subject": "cs 169", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "in0m3ga0jxx7ex", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 1169, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654555572949, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 229}
