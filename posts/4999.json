I wanted to announce a cool upcoming talk by MIT Professor Max Tegmark about his new book,\u00a0<em>Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When: Tuesday, September 26, 3:30-4:30</p>\n<p>Where: Wozniak Lounge, Soda Hall\u00a0</p>\n<p>Event Page:\u00a0http://events.berkeley.edu/?event_ID=111288&amp;date=2017-09-26</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Max Tegmark is a professor of physics at MIT and president of the Future of Life Institute. His research has ranged from cosmology to the physics of intelligence, and is currently focused on the interface between AI, physics, and neuroscience. His recent technical papers focus on AI, including ones accepted to AI venues such as ICML, and typically build on physics-based techniques. He is the author of over 200 publications and the book Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His new book focuses on the big questions of AI: \u00a0How can we grow our prosperity through automation without leaving people lacking income or purpose? What career advice should we give today\u2019s kids? How can we make future AI systems more robust, so that they do what we want without crashing, malfunctioning or getting hacked? Should we fear an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons? Will machines eventually outsmart us at all tasks, replacing humans on the job market and perhaps altogether? Will AI help life flourish like never before or give us more power than we can handle?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-09-17T23:37:07Z", "subject": "Upcoming Talk: MIT Professor Max Tegmark on AI", "uid": "id3qn7yvwgm47r"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j7pdstam5425rh", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 4999, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654551300655, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idril4bcgn84ac", "name": "Vyom Kavishwar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8zl3nphb8", "name": "Dominic Carrano", "photo": "1539468621_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p8zl3nphb8/1539468621_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i54fj8at4ryfv", "name": "Brandon Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isakqfi08sa7ao", "name": "Matthew Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": "100003496029521", "id": "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "name": "Luke Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["idril4bcgn84ac", "is6p8zl3nphb8", "idriks20rqg42v", "i54fj8at4ryfv", "isakqfi08sa7ao", "hyw7jbf3qk2160"], "tags": ["announcements", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 398}
