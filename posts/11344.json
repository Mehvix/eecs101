The odds suck, massively. You should join a startup with all the risks associated because it can still be a great opportunity. But financially speaking, you need to value it appropriately.<br /><br />I *did* join a startup after graduation (employee #7, and I think 2nd non-cofounder engineer -- so pretty\u00a0early), and my shares turned out fine. I mean, I&#39;m\u00a0<strong>incredibly\u00a0</strong>lucky to have the experience I had. I liked it, the people and the product are great. That was why I did it. Statistically speaking, though...positive exits for startups are generally not that positive for normal employees. \u00a0Startup shares are not liquid. You cannot sell them when you need to, even after they vest, and even then they are not on paper worth the value -- for example if you have 0.5% of a 3 mil company, you shares are in theory worth $15,000 but you can&#39;t really sell them because the company is not public. In 12 months when part of it vests you maybe own $5K worth of shares..., if you company if bought before all your shares vest then you only get a fraction what you might have\u00a0planned for. Plus employee stock is the lowest on the totem pole, so unless the rate of return is great you won&#39;t see a full multiple. (There&#39;s also a thing here where startup shares are typically options which larger company stock are typically RSUs, which has some implications too -- especially if you leave the company.)<br /><br />I had another offer from a big tech company, but in Seattle (so, yeah, 1 of the big 2. Salary was basically competitive for the bay based on my friends&#39; offers). Assuming I held my shares after vesting, they would be worth more today than my payout from the acquisition, and the tax advantages would have made significant differences. Or maybe I wouldn&#39;t have held on so long, but probably would have had a house then....but, hey, zero regrets!<br /><br />You don&#39;t have any guarantees with stock price for a public company, but you will be able to sell it for the price on the (virtual) paper. The point is, you have to value what is guaranteed differently from what is possible. You should hope for, and strive for a fantastic outcome at a startup, but you should not make a financial decision assuming your shares will be worth something.<br /><em></em></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jinf3jj62pd560": 1533447817}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jcabcftfzae2k1", "name": "Albert Tang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "irqsaizd7ha30e", "name": "Ronald Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"is2cj7i01en1dj": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguxqczg381ea", "name": "Jason Kim", "photo": "1438238209_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/icguxqczg381ea/1438238209_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jcabcftfzae2k1", "irqsaizd7ha30e", "icguxqczg381ea"], "type": "feedback", "uid": "grqtsu85iy0", "updated": "2020-02-01T02:42:55Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/26 - 2/1", "bucket_order": 104, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-02-01T05:30:47Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k635rbsdyll2dk", "subject": "<p>The highest band i&#39;ve seen for fb new grad return interns is 260-270 year 1 (due to 100k sign-on), and around 190-200 year 2 onwards.

I hate giving 6 figure minimums without simultaneously suggestions we all start canvassing....I am conflicted. That\u2019s why I am here and not engineering full time. ....Anyway...here\u2019s what I will say:<div><br /></div><div>Aim high, but be satisfied that you\u2019ll still be making a good income regardless of outcome. But fight like hell for yourself. You CAN do better than $100K! You should always ask for more than you\u2019ll be\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>First, you should come up with a number where you will have no financial concerns on a monthly basis. Consider where you would like to live, what you spend money on, what loans and family obligations you have. In that calculation factor in healthy financial decisions like saving for retirement and the like. Work backwards from there to get a target salary. Don\u2019t be skimpy on yourself, but of course don\u2019t be overly extravagant. This will give you a number that you can have as a goal for your starting salary. Depending on that range (seriously it varies quite widely, and that\u2019s ok!)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>In terms of salary negotiations\u2014I think asking people early on for a range is BS. It entirely benefits the employers. They have all the knowledge and experience, you do not. So take the number you came up with and ask for quite a bit more.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Many companies won\u2019t move much on salary but may move a fair bit on stock. So many sure that if someone says no, you ask about all the other options.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>When negotiating you should try to have a handful of reasons for upping your offer. One of those is that graduating CS is no small feat! This is an amazing place and you worked very hard for the last 4 years - so remember that. Now, I do not think GPA matters much. In terms of software engineering productivity, \u00a0especially. I know wicked smart people who can design a great algorithm but are not so good at implementing it and make poor teammates. So consider all your advantages, what specific courses help you? What outside domain knowledge are you bringing to the team? Are you a past TA working on an educational app? That\u2019s helpful! A sports fanatic working on some fantasy app? Etc.</div><div>In my experience you\u2019re always walking a bit of a fine line between being confident and cocky. Believe in yourself, the more you do the easier it will be when asking for more. It\u2019s also OK to reference other data points you have. So the links mentioned above are good resources.</div><div><br /></div><div>A few things to be aware of, if you can:\u00a0</div><div>* exploding offers are BS and not allowed through the campus career center. If any company has a relationship with campus they are supposed to follow the career center guidelines even if you didn\u2019t find a job via the career center. Look those up, it\u2019s been a while since I read them. :)</div><div>* negotiate on timelines, too. You can always ask for more time on an offer, some people won\u2019t give it but at this stage companies can afford to...</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe I\u2019ll think of something else but bottom line: always ask for more, but remember how fortunate we are in this position. :)</div><div><br /></div><div>\u2014 that goes for everyone not just OP.\u00a0</div>", "tag_good":

Any suggestions would be appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PS\u00a0I&#39;m a woman, and I don&#39;t want to perpetuate the gender pay gap!</p>", "created": "2020-01-31T09:39:51Z", "subject": "New-Grade Salary Expectations", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 2, "i_edits": [], "id": "k61z7ryfxqxtm", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 11344, "num_favorites": 25, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654544582474, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jieuxxndfm31w", "name": "Phan Le", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "name": "Katie Gu", "photo": "1513749563_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p6j9n6u55fp/1513749563_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "juwz5t7uyqh4sa", "name": "Prakash Srivastava", "photo": "1594332334_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/juwz5t7uyqh4sa/1594332334_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrws68ey2328", "name": "Anish Vankayalapati", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipxjx49hzgs1di", "name": "Jennifer Zou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9s6omub10j", "name": "Jeanelle Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijj65wyjr094o", "name": "Denesh Chandrahasan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jieuxxndfm31w", "is6p6j9n6u55fp", "juwz5t7uyqh4sa", "j6lrws68ey2328", "ipxjx49hzgs1di", "is6p9s6omub10j", "ijj65wyjr094o", "is6p9mf96y2ty"], "tags": ["student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 806}
