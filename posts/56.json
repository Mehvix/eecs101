Both courses are similar in terms of the material covered. \u00a0For example, of the Spring 2015 61B TAs, eight of us were involved with 61BL last summer (six of us as TAs). Regardless of which course you take, you&#39;ll learn about data structures and programming methodology in Java.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But here are some core differences:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. 61B has one discussion section (one hour) and one lab section (two hours) each week. That\u2019s three hours of section. 61BL has four lab sections (three hours) each week. That\u2019s twelve hours of section.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2.\u00a061BL\u2019s weekly workload is far more intense/time-consuming than 61B\u2019s workload. This is due to the time compression of summer. You can expect to spend most of your time working on course, often in Soda. I highly suggest not taking other classes or working in conjunction with 61BL, unless you already have experience in the topics covered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3.\u00a061BL stresses group work on projects far more than 61B does. (This point may vary for 61B offerings depending on the professor/semester.) Projects in 61BL are group projects that require communication and collaboration. Some 61B offerings do not have group projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4.\u00a061BL gives more opportunity to build friendships with GSIs and fellow students, due to being in lab 12 hour each week. It is easier to get individualized attention from staff because of the smaller class size.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5.\u00a0If you learn more easily through lecture, you may want to reconsider taking 61BL. 61BL only has one lecture each week, which is two hours long. Most of the learning will take place during lab. 61B, on the other hand, has three lectures per week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6.\u00a061B is taught by professors/lecturers. 61BL is historically taught by graduated students. For example, Summer 2015 will be taught by Joseph Moghadam, who has TAed three times for 61B/L and once for 188.\u00a0[He is awesome, by the way.]</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "h6r9vy54lle2yu", "updated": "2014-12-26T22:55:16Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2014-12-26T05:14:01Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "i453tr5ylt36ua", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>What is the difference between 61B and 61BL?
