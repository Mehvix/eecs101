In 120 you learn about all the transforms and sampling theory, but you don&#39;t actually learn how to use these algorithms in real applications (and no, Python labs don&#39;t count). 123 is mostly concerned with how to apply signal processing techniques to an application of interest. For example, the capstone project of the class is implementing a modem and transmitting a video file over Walkie Talkies via Raspberry Pi (as in you write the code for the modem, file compression, etc). The class will teach you about digital filters and sampling techniques, but the emphasis is on how these techniques can be applied to real systems. Of course, the class itself has a ton of content, but you&#39;re not going to be asked to prove anything or perform derivations 123 like you would in 221A. I haven&#39;t personally taken 225A or 226A so I can&#39;t comment there, but I imagine they&#39;re more similar to 221A than 123. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>123 isn&#39;t a hard requirement for some 22X classes because 123 isn&#39;t a theory class. However, you will definitely benefit from having 123 for classes like 225B, 225E, and 261, which also deal with real-world data and are more application-driven. 123 and 225A/226A are definitely different styles of classes. 225A and 226A are introductory graduate theory classes. 123 is basically a senior signal processing capstone.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for what three classes to take, that depends on what your goals are. You say research, but the classes for someone looking to do medical imaging are very very different from someone looking to study information theory. Signal processing is a big field so you&#39;re going to have to be a bit more specific. I personally found 123 immensely useful for my research in imaging. But if you want to do DSP in applications, 151 is a good class to take. You need to understand that signal processing doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. What are you implementing your DSP algorithms on? Software implementations are always going to be slower than bare-metal FPGA implementations, so it&#39;s a good idea to get acquainted with the hardware of digital systems before you start discounting the need to study hardware. As an HFT finance example, in the time that it takes SciPy to LPF a signal, an FPGA has already done 100 LPFs and traded multiple times.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by limited time. Are you right about to graduate? If the former, definitely take EE 123 and EECS 151 because they&#39;re pretty good &#34;big picture&#34; classes as a graduating senior.\u00a0 Otherwise, your course selection should be the topics that you enjoyed most in 120. Feedback control loops? 128. Sampling? 123. Linear systems? 221A. Maybe 126 if you want to get a taste of statistical methods, but I&#39;m not qualified to comment on classes in that area.</p>", "created": "2021-01-04T21:30:46Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kjj2vsl2n0f3e0", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1606759530}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c0doezc36ju", "name": "Anirudh Natarajan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lewijx93v2sc", "name": "Jay Shenoy", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ke609ylh5ap5uv": 1600316854}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jli5m1s2lBED", "name": "Nareauphol (Gavin) Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ke1qafm27ca6tv": 1607558356}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyga1q8dp76637", "name": "Ashwin Rammohan", "photo": "1571205032_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jyga1q8dp76637/1571205032_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p815tz306kj", "name": "Averal Kandala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "name": "Ritvik Iyer", "photo": "1568015728_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjs6gec3ivg12c/1568015728_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "name": "David Au", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kbua2f04n1051c": 1594933377}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdiymttub4tw", "name": "Neeraj Shenoy", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbkgnwut1jl74a", "name": "Mike Xiao", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "ke2c0doezc36ju", "j6lewijx93v2sc", "jli5m1s2lBED", "jyga1q8dp76637", "is6p815tz306kj", "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "jzqdiymttub4tw", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "kbkgnwut1jl74a", "j6gtkkw4sr227"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-04T21:53:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjj3oizy3gf6nf", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thank you so much for your input!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvg5rtq4e4uz"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-01-04T21:53:06Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-08T19:21:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kjoo12okxab4eh", "subject": "<p>Technically no class has any prereqs if you&#39;re committed enough to self-studying.
