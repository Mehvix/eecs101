EE105 can be taught by a lot of professors and the teaching quality is expected to not vary a lot, but regarding EE142, I only know Prof. Niknejad can teach it. EE142 is a class that I was looking forward to taking when I was a freshman. It is known as one of the most challenging course in EE. It has already been offered once a year, which means canceling the course for only one time will vastly change some students&#39; schedule. I really want to take it in my last year instead of not knowing anything about RF after I graduate. As far as I know, it is also crucial to graduate students who are first grade PhD. EE240C has already been not offered in Fall 2016. It seems like analog PhDs cannot have enough number of &#34;right&#34; courses to take, only EE240A EE251A present.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2016-10-06T22:14:36Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/2 - 10/8", "bucket_order": 190, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-06T22:23:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "itywtvwzban47p", "subject": "<p>I&#39;m sorry that this is frustrating.
