The course is basically split into three parts -- lexing &amp; parsing, semantic analysis &amp; type checking, code generation. Lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, and type checking don&#39;t require any 61C knowledge at all if I&#39;m remembering correctly. Most of the content is taught in lecture and all the algorithms and steps to do these parts of the compiler are pretty much laid out step by step for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, code generation does require a bit of 61C knowledge, mainly memory management and working with assembly. Part 3 of the project will pretty much be outputting appropriate assembly instructions. For thinks like function calls for example, you&#39;d have to know how the stack/memory is managed and how code is run in general from memory. That being said, it is covered a little bit in class but it&#39;s definitely super helpful to know going forward. It&#39;s also the last part of the project and toward the end of the semester so if you put in the time to understand memory management and looked at a bit of 61C before then, I&#39;d say it&#39;s doable.</p>", "created": "2020-04-22T08:01:04Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k9b1slfqauf4pn", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4ey8blw42u", "name": "Shuangyuan Yang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6nu4ey8blw42u"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10557": 8, "1375": 0, "2553": 7, "5523": 1, "6549": 5, "7746": 3, "7792": 4, "8933": 9, "9195": 2, "9351": 6}}, "created": "2020-04-22T07:03:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>How important is 61C for 164?
