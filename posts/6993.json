I want to take it this summer but I haven&#39;t taken CS 160 and have only taken up to CS 61B. These are the prereqs listed:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming experience required: You will program embedded systems for this course. You should be able to pick up a new language and API (with some help from us). Knowing the equivalent of the CS61A-C series at Berkeley should be sufficient. </li><li>User Interface Design experience very useful: Your projects will have both software and hardware user interfaces. Some background in user interface design, e.g., INFO290 Tangible Interaction or CS160 User Interface Design is valuable. </li><li>3D modeling skills very useful, but not required: You will model and fabricate parts on our FDM machine. If you want to get a head start, learn how to use SolidWorks, but we&#39;ll also have a tutorial.</li><li>Some electronics experience useful, but not required: You will build basic sensing and actuation circuits. The threshold for doing this has decreased rapidly in recent years, but you will be soldering your own electronics. If you have taken the equivalent of EE40 or have built projects Arduino boards before, you&#39;ll be fine.</li></ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-summer-desinv-190e-1-lec-1\" target=\"_blank\">http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-summer-desinv-190e-1-lec-1</a></p>", "created": "2018-05-13T05:41:51Z", "subject": "Background for DES INV 190E-1: Interactive Device Design?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jh4e6qt85qi3vi", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6993, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549337369, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "name": "Jason Xie", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy0slp1n9kt3u9", "name": "Jason Zhou", "photo": "1548118179_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iy0slp1n9kt3u9/1548118179_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "iy0slp1n9kt3u9"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "lscs", "other", "peer_directed", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 244}
