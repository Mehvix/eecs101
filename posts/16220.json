Just to illustrate how far and fast it is traveling you will notice that yesterday the balloon went to sleep at a latitude of 31 (south-Georgia , south of Tijuana equivalent). It woke up this morning at a latitude of 42 (Boston, MA). At the end of the day it went to sleep at a latitude of 48! (New Foundland). Since we are getting close to the winter solstice, it gets dark quickly in these areas, so days are very short.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The prediction for our balloon is that it will go over Iceland, enter Norway from the north, then Sweden, Finland, Estonia where it is predicted to be 24 hours from now. Attached is the prediction.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Now, most of you do not have radios, nor access to radios. As it turns out, there are many amateur radio operators who are running web servers that allow you to listen to various frequency bands received by their stations. You can effectively control the radios and demodulate and listen to different signals, for voice as well as digital.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>This is a link to a map of many receivers you can tune to:\u00a0https://www.receiverbook.de/map?type=openwebrx . You will have to use a chrome browser to make this work. Feel free to check some of these out!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If you want to listen to a WSPR signal in Europe, here\u2019s a link to a station in the Netherlands:</div>\n<p>During the day (in Europe) listen to: http://kiwisdr.ddns.net:8074/#freq=14095600,mod=usb,secondary_mod=wspr,sql=-150</p>\n<div>During the night (in Europe) listen to :\u00a0http://kiwisdr.ddns.net:8074/#freq=7038600,mod=usb,secondary_mod=wspr,sql=-150</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If you wait about 5 minutes, you should be able to see decodes.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>They have a format of : UTC, dB, DT, Freq, and Message.\u00a0</div>\n<div>UTC is the time in Coordinated Universal Time</div>\n<div>dB is the signal to noise ratio (SNR) \u00a0the signal was received at. \u00a0The higher it is, the stronger the signal is. Just to give an illustration, the SNR of -12db is barely audible. WSPR can dig signals out of the noise as low as -31dB, which is about a 100 times weaker.\u00a0</div>\n<div>DT is the delay of the signal, measured in seconds. WSPR transmission are synchronized to the an even minute and all start at the same time.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Freq: is the frequency in Hz</div>\n<div>Message has the format of: \u00a0Callsign, position, power. \u00a0 \u00a0Callsign is the callsign of the beacon station. The position is described by two letters and two numbers, which represent a grid square on the earth (here\u2019s one for the US:\u00a0https://w9dup.org/grid_squares.html), and the power is the transmitted power of the station in dbm units.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>For example:\u00a0</div>\n<div><br />UTC dB DT Freq Message<br />162400 -26 1.4 14097026 VE3KCL\u00a0IM40\u00a010</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>VE3KCL is the callsign of\u00a0David H Beverstein, from Toronto Canada (https://www.qrz.com/lookup need a free account)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>IM40 is a square over the Atlantic west of the coast of Morocco (this is also a balloon!) \u00a0(grid square locator link:\u00a0https://www.levinecentral.com/ham/grid_square.php)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>10 means 10dbm, which is also 10 milliwatts\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More tomorrow\u2026.
