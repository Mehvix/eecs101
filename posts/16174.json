I ended up doing 151LB, 152, 184, 3 units of research, and some club leadership positions. So, a retrospective:\n\nThis semester has been pretty hard and I&#39;ve been busy pretty much the whole time, but I honestly didn&#39;t find it unmanageably so. I still had time to hang out with friends, going skating, and had enough time between deadlines that I could just spend a whole day each week taking a break. I didn&#39;t really have much time to spend on personal projects and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like to have done this while recruiting, but it&#39;s totally doable.\n\n151LB has been pretty chill. I think a lot of it is a &#34;knack&#34; sort of thing and so if you end up with a strong intuitive sense for digital design you can really just speed through the projects with little to no debugging. I won&#39;t say that everyone has this experience but I know a good number of people who were in a similar boat. I like to joke that 151 is extremely easy so long as you don&#39;t make any mistakes, and it&#39;s very true because tracking down bugs in huge circuits by staring at waveforms and dumping debug data into registers is certainly not as convenient as stepping through code in gdb. The primary time sink for the class came with the final project. You have long deadlines but you also have a lot of work to do. You&#39;re supposed to work on the project over the period of 2&#43; weeks, but my project partner and I managed to cram the whole thing into a weekend and get checked off the following Monday. It was exhausting but mostly our fault lol. \n\n152 is a similar story. Labs are pretty time intensive and if you choose to do the &#34;cool&#34; ones (cache reverse engineering, Spectre exploitation, etc.) they can easily take two to three days. If you&#39;re less dedicated to doing something cool and are more interested in just surviving, I&#39;m sure going for the other lab options would reduce the workload substantially.\n\n184 was also pretty time heavy but, again, the deadlines are very long and so you have a ton of flexibility with how and when you do things. Lots of debugging and writing, but the flexibility in timing and very easy going grading (there&#39;s no AG, it&#39;s just screenshots and vibes) made it manageable.\n\nOverall, 151&#43;152 is a fine combo. You&#39;ll be busy but if you really like low level stuff and really want to immerse yourself it, there&#39;s no better a way. If you don&#39;t want to take them concurrently, I would personally recommend 151 and then 152 just because some of the design decisions that come up implicitly in 152 are explained through intuition formed in 151. I&#39;d probably do it again if I had to (and I probably will, next semester is going to be equally spicy LOL) purely because there are just so many good classes here and so little time to take them all.", "created": "2022-04-20T19:53:52Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Have you consider late p/np right before you die midway through the semester?
