While it does cover ML extremely briefly, it does not go very in depth with this as the focus of the course is not really ML. To answer your questions specifically:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) CS 161 project 1 is fairly difficult in that you need to understand conceptually the topics from class covered in the project; not much actual coding, but knowledge of 61C is pretty much required. Project 2 is conceptually easier but much harder to actually implement as well as being vastly more time consuming (as an example, I spent ~10 hours total on project 1 but ~25-30 hours total on project 2). Project 3 at least when I took it Spring 2018 was extremely easy and straightforward (&lt; 3 hours total) but this may change since it was an experimental project that semester.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) Probably redundant to take DS 100 based on the classes you&#39;ve taken and are planning to take.
