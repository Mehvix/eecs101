There are cryptography/security courses, pure CS theory, obviously ML, computer architecture/digital design, signal processing, robotics, IC design, just to name a few. The EE/CS/EECS offerings at this school are pretty large and many courses are interdisciplinary. You might wanna shop around on the course catalog for the EE and CS courses and see what you might be interested in. Look at some of the websites if possible, maybe check out the piazza forums as well, most are open. Its a shame that its hard to gauge interests with just the lower divs (to the fault of no one). I think the 16 series gives people a real sour taste for EE courses, even though the upper divs are nothing like those 2 courses. Also there is a quant finance decal that is still taking applications I believe if you want to check that out as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When your early in your college career, you might think you want to do something, but you might take a class that will lead you down another path. The only way to know is to do some self-research into the courses, and try some out! As a tip from a graduating senior, don&#39;t think too hard about the &#34;i dont know what im going to do with my life&#34; stuff, it only gets in the way. Your in a CS program at one of the top universities in the world. You&#39;ll be fine, just take courses in what comes naturally. You&#39;ll be able to pivot into almost anything else you want down the line should you feel the need. Good luck.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeun3n6ef0vj", "name": "Kevin Han", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "name": "Ashwin Vangipuram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c00ws3o268b", "name": "Sashrika Pandey", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijj65wyjr094o", "name": "Denesh Chandrahasan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kbeun3n6ef0vj", "jktvgwu8z5z5gy", "ke2c00ws3o268b", "ijj65wyjr094o"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-01-29T18:57:16Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/24 - 1/30", "bucket_order": 16, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-31T01:57:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kkkhuvzzwnk2k4", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Don&#39;t go into fintech.
