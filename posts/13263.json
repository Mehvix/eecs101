Just grind out 61B, 16B, 70 this spring\n(2). 61B, 70, HSS and then next fall 61C, 16B, and Upper div \n\npart of my worry is in conjunction with an all-remote spring semester and 16-weeks of grind in scenario 1. But in scenario 2 I can imagine the workload is the same if not greater than scenario 1 coupled with recruiting season. \n\nOne of my arguments for 2. would also be I could take an upper-div that I enjoyed so while the workload would be more or less the same, the grind may not be as bad when you're taking a course or two that you thoroughly enjoy\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time to read this!
