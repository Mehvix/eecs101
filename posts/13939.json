Just as a side note - my opinions are definitely not the truth, just my thoughts.</p>\n<ul><li>There&#39;s a lot of Master&#39;s programs out there. If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;d recommend doing the right research to see if anything caters to your taste. This is my observation of the dichotomy of the programs based on my own preparations.<br />\n<ul><li>Professional Master&#39;s - These are more coursework heavy, 1 year programs meant to get you prepared for industry. Brashly put, it would fit what the original solution described about transitioning into CS, or giving oneself another go at a recruiting cycle with hopefully a better offer. It&#39;s also great for diving deeper into a field of interest\n<ul><li>Coursework could make you more capable. In four years, let&#39;s roughly say you spent 4/8 semesters&#39; time completing lower divs &#43; general requirements and the other half doing CS upper divs. 2-3 upper divs per semester * 4 = 8-12 upper divs. That&#39;s really solid, especially in Berkeley&#39;s CS program. But maybe you enjoyed OS &#43; security and want to work on systems level cybersecurity. 162 &#43; 161 covers a lot of concepts, but it&#39;s the tip of the iceberg in terms of covering the field you&#39;re interested in. A master&#39;s program where you can take 4-6 more classes on cryptography, privacy-preserving systems, software engineering architecture design, etc. could help a lot.</li><li>A counter-argument to ^ - &#34;You can learn on the job&#34; - Yes, no doubt about that, and that definitely could be what works for some people. But with the Master&#39;s, you get to control what you study. In industry, with production pressure and deadlines, what you spend time on is heavily determined by the company&#39;s initiatives, not just your own.</li></ul>\n</li><li>Research focused Master&#39;s - In addition to specialized coursework, these usually 2-years (Berkeley 5th years is an exception) programs are great to dive deeper and specialize in topics that one might not have time to fully explore during undergrad, primarily through research (M.S. thesis) &#43; coursework.\n<ul><li>With this track, you will have accomplished a good amount; a lot of outcomes are ones undergrad programs usually don&#39;t have or offer - publications, close connections with professors / grad students, M.S. thesis (40-50 pages of your writing).</li><li>This opens doors to opportunities that a lot of undergraduate level students might not be as capable of (i.e. robotics, ML/DL, data science). Of the top of my head, if you look at a lot of AV companies, internships for working on things like onboard runtime, mapping, perception, motion planning, etc. will look for someone with M.S. and above experience, specializing in that field. Berkeley is very strong in Systems, security, AI, and ML research, but there&#39;s a lot of other fields that might pique your interest &#43; have corresponding industry roles (i.e. PL, databases, networking, infrastructure). Like Beaker said, I agree that &#34;research intern&#34; roles are still largely limited to Ph.D.&#39;s; with that said, M.S.&#39;s opportunities &gt; B.S.&#39;s opportunities - the difference is not day and night, but it very much exists.</li><li>You get to carry out projects from the ground up. Often times, in industry, you&#39;ll be working on legacy code, so not building systems from scratch. A Master&#39;s program could be good exercise to bring a project or complicated system from ideation to tangible fruition. That experience could be really helpful to being a great engineer. The Master&#39;s of course, is not the only way to build your own projects. However, the guarantees are that you&#39;d likely be working on something pretty involved that not any developer could do, and you&#39;ll have the mentorship of some very smart people (i.e. advising professor, other Ph.D./Masters students).</li><li>Test the waters for if you want to do a Ph.D. You can always go back to industry after your Ph.D., and after the Master&#39;s, if you want to put in a couple extra years, there&#39;s definitely programs that would take less time than 5-6 years b/c you have a Master&#39;s (i.e. Ph.D.&#39;s in Europe take 3-4 years, not 5-6 like in U.S. - fully funded housing &#43; living in the UK while working on research?? :P). This path would of course, open you up to a lot of roles that undergrads are almost never considered for.</li><li>To put it into perspective, 10000&#43;&#39;s (my guess-timate, not an official number) of CS undergrads from U.S. universities enter the market every year. On the contrary, much fewer (maybe 20000&#43;? again just a guess) are CS graduate degree. If you just google &#34;tech talent shortage&#34;, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a pretty big gap in specialized software engineering roles. A Master&#39;s could make you a pretty strong candidate.</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>&#34;aren&#39;t mentally ready to join the real world&#34; - Depends. I think that definitely could be true in a few cases, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an overwhelmingly huge camp of people.</li><li>&#34;MS isn&#39;t really relevant / not enough to start at a higher level&#34; - depends on the position. For a general front/back/full-stack engineering role - Yes. For things like AV, robotics, ML/DL, some infrastructure/network architecture roles - No. Some companies also do hire M.S. grads at a higher level (depends on the program).</li><li>Slight bonus - Yes. That could be an extra 20-30K. Of course, it&#39;ll take you a while (5-6 years) to make up for the 1-2 years you spent on the Master. But careers are non-linear so what you&#39;ll be doing/earning 5-6 years from now might not be your present situation (promotion? :O).</li><li>&#34;mostly for people who didn&#39;t get a good enough job / transition into CS&#34; - I agree with this except for the &#34;mostly&#34; part. It&#39;s hard to put a number on the split for reasons one pursue&#39;s a Master, but as mentioned above, there&#39;s more factors and outcomes than just this.</li></ul>\n<p>I think a better way of answering this question is focusing on not only on earnings, but also on what you want to do.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Again, just to reiterate, I think there were a lot of strong, correct points made before, not trying to start a flame war here. I spent a good amount of time making a similar decision a year ago, so just thought I&#39;d put down the things I considered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to make money ASAP, then by all means, a job is the way to go.

The class I teach has consistently had two to three 10-hour MS TA&#39;s every semester for as long as I can remember (I&#39;ve been teaching for 8 semesters), so I never thought twice about relying on TA&#39;ing to fund my tuition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re an undergrad from your responses in this thread so far, but if you are, I don&#39;t think you should let this psuedo department policy deter you. I imagine if you have a good relationship with at least one professor he/she would let you do a 10-hour.

Again, not sure what your background is, so apologies if it sounds like I&#39;m condescending. Unless you already have an MS and are working in a research role that you feel woefully underprepared for, I don&#39;t think you should let these misconceptions deter you from applying :) I think the thesis requirement does make you into a stronger researcher / engineer, even if it&#39;s not as rigorous as a PhD. And at least among the PhD&#39;s I know, many of them have no interest in leaving academia so I imagine the competition for an industry MS/PhD position is... well, mostly MS haha (that, plus the fact that the number of PhD&#39;s in the USA is already very low)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2020-12-22T04:24:09Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 12/20 - 12/26", "bucket_order": 59, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-12-22T04:34:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kizhuajto7v7ny", "subject": "<p>I should also mention that I&#39;m not an anomalous MS student who happens to be more research-heavy.

(I will likely have <em>a\u00a0</em>job that I won&#39;t mind starting out with through a return offer, but am hoping to find something better).\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I understand that a masters degree doesn&#39;t have much profit income-wise for entry level in industry, but does it help as you go higher? can it help you get promoted faster and/or be a more-highly regarded employee? if so, what are the benefits? asking this because the whole process of looking for and doing undergraduate research seems a little daunting and time-consuming, and I&#39;m looking for opinions on if it would be worth it or if in hindsight my time would&#39;ve been better spent preparing for industry and just aiming to get a better job immediately after undergrad. it&#39;s just kinda difficult because it seems neither option (doing undergrad research or upping my industry skills) has a guarantee of success proportional to the effort I&#39;d put in... I just don&#39;t know what to do.</p>\n<p>- how should I begin choosing a research area? I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m interested in; thus far I&#39;ve just been aiming to work as a SDE in back-end and I don&#39;t even have many UDs under my belt. where should I start?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>also, if I start in industry and decide to do a masters later while working-- I&#39;m pretty much limited to doing an online degree, which berkeley doesn&#39;t offer, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know some of these questions are kinda subjective so if nothing else I&#39;d really appreciate hearing from people who are doing or looking to do a 5th year masters and
