If CS-intended freshmen and/or other students for whom we&#39;re reserving seats don&#39;t opt to take this class in spring, then all the seats will go to the waitlist in order. Since you need this class to graduate next semester, we would encourage you to enroll in something else now versus wait until Phase II is over when those alternatives may be full. To make the decision even harder for you, remember the rule is that 10% of enrolled students will drop. Depending on your waitlist position, you could risk it. I think it depends on whether you want to enroll now in something that will fulfill the requirement and have peace of mind, or whether you&#39;re okay with waiting it out.</p>", "created": "2016-10-19T16:55:25Z", "subject": "", "uid": "ibtip4ceues3g0"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "iuh5tjdtuu36oq", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-10-19T16:49:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>So just to confirm for seniors graduating in Spring,\u00a0unless we&#39;re already enrolled in the class then we&#39;re hopeless?</p>", "created": "2016-10-19T16:54:10Z", "subject": "EE16A for Graduating Seniors Email", "uid_a": "a_0"}, {"anon": "full", "content": "<p>So just to confirm for seniors graduating in Spring,\u00a0unless we&#39;re already enrolled in the class then we&#39;re screwed?</p>", "created": "2016-10-19T16:49:39Z", "subject": "EE16A for Graduating Seniors Email", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 2, "i_edits": [], "id": "iuh5m4rzdyf1v4", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 2378, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654554316518, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 232}
