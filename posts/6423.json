Even if they are not I really doubt that EE16A has a possible substitute that you can take somewhere else and have it count without labs. If a possible substitute exists it will definitely have labs, which you (probably) won&#39;t have the time to do because you&#39;ll be interning. Just take it next semester. EE16A is a lot of fun and might even encourage you to try a bit more on the EECS side.

The math department didn&#39;t transfer exactly perfectly and I ended up getting like 3 out of 4 units for math 54 (what does that even mean? The professor basically just told me I get 3/4ths credit for the class, so I still need to take it). The CS department is a\u00a0bit nicer and\u00a0formalized and has an online form to fill out.
