Next semester Professor Shewchuk will be teaching and his lectures are very easy to understand and explain the material very well. If you have no machine learning background, this is the perfect way to get introduced to the material. It doesn&#39;t just skim over topics but it doesn&#39;t go extremely deep either. Also, the prerequisites aren&#39;t strictly enforced. The only bit of material that you might need to know is a little probability and also linear algebra, both of which you can easily review during the course. Covariance is a big topic in some portions but for that the lecture provides a very good intro and you can just brush up through online sources/CS70 notes. The workload can be a little much at times but in general the assignments are very interesting. Would recommend to take it with some friends though, that always makes any course easier and more fun.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-10-30T05:51:36Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-10-29T23:05:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed", "lscs", "faculty_advising", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I only have 2 more CS upper division requirements left for my upcoming semester (last semester).
