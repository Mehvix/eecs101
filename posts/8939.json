This semester, Spring 2019, is my first semester back at Cal since withdrawing. I was given non-competitive readmission in Fall 2018 and have never been on academic probation, if these details matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Would this set of circumstances make me a student &#34;Admitted to the university before fall 2017&#34; in regards to the L&amp;S CS major requirements? I&#39;m trying to catch up by taking courses over the summer and am trying to figure out how to most efficiently complete my requirements. The official course policy states that students admitted before fall 2017 can choose to only complete EE16A and Math 54\u00a0and use those two classes to fully meet major requirements. However, for students admitted post fall 2017, EE16A and EE16B must both be taken no matter what for the major declaration.<br /><br />This summer, EE16B is not offered, but Math 54 is, and I just completed EE16A this semester. I can possibly graduate more quickly if I\u00a0can take Math 54 over the summer\u00a0to fulfill my major requirements more quickly, which may be financially necessary for me to do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Which year of my admission would be used in applying the CS major requirements in my case, and which set of rules am I bound by in order to declare the L&amp;S CS Major? I&#39;m trying to figure out if I&#39;m allowed to take only Math 54 and EE16A or if this schedule would be invalid for CS major admission.
