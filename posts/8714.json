Requests to accommodate a student&#39;s religious creed by scheduling tests or examinations at alternative times should be submitted directly to the faculty member responsible for administering the examination.<br /><br />Reasonable common sense, judgment and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved.<br /><br />The link to this policy is available in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://registrar.berkeley.edu/calendar\" target=\"_blank\">Religious Creed</a>\u00a0section of the Academic Calendar webpage.<br /><br />Religious Holidays Calendar<br />A\u00a0<a href=\"https://teaching.berkeley.edu/religious-holidays-2017-2018-academic-year\" target=\"_blank\">2018-19 Religious Holidays Calendar</a>\u00a0has been compiled and is now posted on the Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019s website. This calendar will be updated on an annual basis to assist faculty and staff in course and activity planning and to reference in the accommodation process.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CONFLICTS BETWEEN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS<br />The Academic Senate has established Guidelines Concerning Scheduling Conflicts with Academic Requirements to address the issue of conflicts that arise between extracurricular activities and academic requirements. These policies specifically concern the schedules of student athletes, student musicians, those with out-of-town interviews, and other students with activities (e.g., classes missed as the result of religious holy days) that compete with academic obligations.<br /><br />These policies were updated in Spring 2014 to include the following statement:<br /><br />-The pedagogical needs of the class are the key criteria when deciding whether a proposed accommodation is appropriate. Faculty must clearly articulate the specific pedagogical reasons that prevent accepting a proposed accomm odation. Absent such a reason, the presumption should be that accommodations are to be made.<br /><br />The guidelines assign responsibilities as follows:<br /><br />-It is the instructor\u2019s responsibility to give students a schedule, available on the syllabus in the first week of instruction, of all class sessions, exams, tests, project deadlines, field trips, and any other required class activities.<br /><br />-It is the student\u2019s responsibility to notify the instructor(s) in writing by the second week of the semester of any potential conflict(s) and to recommend a solution, with the understanding that an earlier deadline or date of examination may be the most practicable solution.<br /><br />-It is the student\u2019s responsibility to inform him/herself about material missed because of an absence, whether or not he /she has been formally excused.<br /><br />The\u00a0<a href=\"https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/ugc\" target=\"_blank\">complete guidelines</a>\u00a0are available on the Academic Senate website. Additionally, a\u00a0<a href=\"https://teaching.berkeley.edu/checklist-scheduling-conflicts-academic-requirements\" target=\"_blank\">checklist</a>\u00a0to help instructors and students comply with the guidelines is available on the Center for Teaching and Learning website.<br /><br />**Please note:\u00a0Simultaneous proctored administration of a remote exam is an appropriate solution to exam security concerns. Berkeley faculty, faculty at the destination institution and the normal proctoring services here and remotely are presumed to be suitable sources of independent proctoring. Care should be taken that conflict of interest or the appearance of conflict of interest be avoided in undertaking proxy p roctorships. It is not a significant increase in faculty workload to have a suitable proctor pick up exam copy(s) several days in advance, followed by returning the completed exams with several days after administration.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-02-01T17:08:54Z", "subject": "Ramadan &amp; Finals", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jrmaz70mvvq1qy", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8714, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547504366, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "instructor-note"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 628}
