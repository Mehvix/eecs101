After you&#39;ve settled on the direction you want to go in, you can digitize your designs. Nowadays, the industry standard is Figma (<a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.figma.com/</a>), which isn&#39;t difficult to start using. I think if you make your account with a Berkeley email, there&#39;s a free Education plan. For basic wireframing, the main tools you&#39;ll need are just drawing shapes and adding some text.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Honestly, you can use any software for wireframes as long as you communicate your ideas. You can draw stuff in Google Slides if you&#39;re more familiar with that. But in the long run, Figma is good to learn because it&#39;s built for product design, and is used by design teams in the industry.</p>", "created": "2020-09-15T03:15:59Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j5swigc8gzd516"}], "id": "kf3dwc7mkud283", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is0vls53gakb4", "name": "Rafael A.
