But yea, I was just wondering if taking 127 was ABSOLUTELY necessary to having a key understanding of the material or not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, as is common with Berkeley students, I too am looking for internships this summer and plan to apply to get them, however I do not feel as if I have many &#34;employable&#34; skills so I was wondering if taking 189 would help with that, or would taking a class like CS186 be more fruitful?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All comments and replies are appreciated :)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you read this long, thank you!</p>", "created": "2018-10-06T04:56:59Z", "subject": "CS189", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jmwyveom5g0id", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 7735, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548570156, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4w0h8ra37l9", "name": "Amanda Schwartz", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lisawynax62x", "name": "Jialin Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567784220, "j7s01y165odq5": 1526596257, "jr0d08qbk7i3s6": 1555082786}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ipraxv6jn6h0", "name": "Aditya Jhanwar", "photo": "1568219580_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6ipraxv6jn6h0/1568219580_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is9ehwc6yhy4n6", "name": "Claire Dubin", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iwp9j1ik6bb7hw", "name": "Aarti Lalwani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6d4w0h8ra37l9", "j6lisawynax62x", "j6ipraxv6jn6h0", "is9ehwc6yhy4n6", "iwp9j1ik6bb7hw"], "tags": ["peer_directed", "student", "suggestion_box", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 377}
