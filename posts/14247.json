I think fall is critical for research progress, but some of it was out of my control too as I still am in a learning process. Therefore, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my mentor&#39;s fault, but would like to have a more informed opinion from someone who went to Berkeley as an undergrad about how to do things</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2021-01-19T08:08:44Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-19T04:24:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kk3htzb99ik3td", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Here&#39;s my 2 cents for what it&#39;s worth. For background, I&#39;m currently a grad student who did their undergraduate at Berkeley in CS, worked on research as an undergrad, am currently working on research, hoping to get some publications, and mentoring undergraduates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. You sound like you are doing really great and in your academic career so far. Getting mostly As, double majoring in applied math, and having 1&#43; years of research experience as a junior is extremely impressive. It is great preparation for graduate school (either the 5th year masters or a PhD). Better than what most people you would be competing with for grad school get.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. That&#39;s unfortunate that your mentor (&#39;sort of&#39; to quote you) discouraged you from applying to graduate school. A mentor should really just not do that. A mentor should also not tell you that they would not write a good letter of recommendation for you. They are supposed to be your advocate, not your detractor. If they are saying these things to you, it is inappropriate, disrespectful, and unprofessional and you should take that up with someone higher up in your lab. Your work/research environment should be about the work, not stress over your relationship with your mentor/supervisor. You sound like an extremely well qualified candidate and will definitely end up somewhere amazing for grad school. Regardless of whatever one person&#39;s opinion is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. It sounds to me like there was/is some kind of miscommunication between you and this graduate student. These kinds of miscommunications are common in any professional context and it is important for your professional development to learn how to address them. Miscommunications can really only be fixed by having honest conversations about what you are capable of doing in terms of your skills and time availability and about what your goals are for your research experience at Berkeley. Frankness and directness tempered with respect is your best way forward. If you feel like you can address your problems directly with your mentor, do that. If you feel like you want to talk about this to someone higher up in your lab like a faculty member, do that. If you think all of this is a lost cause, I&#39;m sure another lab would take you in a heartbeat seeing how experienced you are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. Finally, don&#39;t give into imposter syndrome. A lot of Berkeley students deal with it. If you are at Berkeley and working at a prestigious lab, its because you work hard enough and are smart enough to be there. You&#39;re not just faking it. I promise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Happy to answer any other questions here or if you want to email me, ping me at jakemtibbetts@berkeley.edu</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6congzb11855f", "name": "Lily Bhattacharjee", "photo": "1621442647_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6congzb11855f/1621442647_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jn6nixnsh63tl", "name": "Eric Gai", "photo": "1611367926_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jn6nixnsh63tl/1611367926_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfb9m79q49m", "name": "Violet Yao", "photo": "1597777605_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvfb9m79q49m/1597777605_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1571985065, "kdhvjzdceb91ll": 1607826884}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "name": "Jay Monga", "photo": "1580804937_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvg5rtq4e4uz/1580804937_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgoe0t1k57a", "name": "Kristy Lee", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "name": "Andrew Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3kb12o13jp", "name": "Jennifer Xiao", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6congzb11855f", "jn6nixnsh63tl", "jktvfb9m79q49m", "jktvg5rtq4e4uz", "jktvgoe0t1k57a", "jzqdhqjfxui43k", "j6nu3kb12o13jp"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p6s8o8wt5n9", "updated": "2021-01-19T04:24:39Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/17 - 1/23", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/17 - 1/23", "bucket_order": 25, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-20T07:55:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kk54t6gonl95i8", "subject": "Regarding the other undergrad and the grad school situation: yes, and this is also my understanding of the situation.

My background is starting research in sophomore year (fall 2019) to do a ML project, followed by some lighter research involving neural networks in spring 2020. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m in a reputable lab this semester (which I will not name for anonymity) and I got stuck last semester due to 1) some gaps in knowledge for pytorch, 2) I was doing pretty badly in one of my classes and had to study hard for the final(and didn&#39;t know how to deal with bad grades) to perform a clobber, and also 3) didn&#39;t really know what I was doing the past semester. I&#39;ve finished learning pytorch over break. However, while the plan is to publish in May/June, I feel like the PhD student I work with isn&#39;t confident in me. He said that he is working with another undergrad and wants to get publications out with him in February/March. Then he also told me that I should keep his weekly meetings but I&#39;m pretty discouraged and afraid that publication won&#39;t work. He also sort of said I hope you and the aforementioned undergrad don&#39;t apply to PhD at the same time because the other undergrad is very advanced(and he is -- he&#39;s worked with GPUs since high school, but why is that kind of expectation imposed on me when the undergraduate is clearly advanced and is taking like 4-5 technicals / semester which not every standard student in research does) and the rec letters would be really different. like I just want to do research and do things on time</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This isn&#39;t really his fault either because there are learning curves in research and maybe I&#39;m not directly taught everything because everything&#39;s online, and he was not a Berkeley undergrad and he thinks I should take my time.
