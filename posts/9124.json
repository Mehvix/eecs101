Worst case, if you&#39;re dying on a problem set, your friends can help you figure out the answers. For 61C, it&#39;s a lot more difficult to get help, especially since friends can&#39;t really help with your entire logic, and they can&#39;t debug. In addition, 61C just has a lot more busy work(weekly labs, gradescope hw, coding assignments, projects).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, 61C opens up the doors to upper division courses like 161 and 162 (186, 168 do not need 61C), so in case you&#39;re rushing to take those classes, switch to 61C and 160.
