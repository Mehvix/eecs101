Not to say that 189 is not a math heavy course, it&#39;s very important to make sure you take the prereqs seriously if you want to do well, but I feel like currently I would do so much better if I had taken Math 110 or EE 126 or even Stat 135 before this class. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would definitely recommend at least taking either Math 110 or EE 126 before this class.
