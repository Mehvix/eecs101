All of these things have taken up a lot of time to the point where I&#39;ve been falling behind in my classes, especially EE16A.

I&#39;m confident I can pass EE16A. I want to P/NP EE16A so that I can focus on my other classes and just do really well in them, and not have to worry about EE16A. The only thing that concerns me is the effect it has on grad school. For reference my GPA is a ~3.8.\u00a0I want to apply for the 5th year MS program, and I&#39;m worried that a P in EE16A might look bad. Does anyone have any experience or thoughts they can share on this?
