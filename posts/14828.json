I did 61C, 170 and 120 together in 1 semester. I thought it was managable since 120&#39;s workload was low-medium with just 7 homeworks and a couple of iPython labs. If you wanna previwe how hard the content is, you can watch a first few lectures of when I took 120 with Babak (the GOAT professor): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgvTQm-n0cI&amp;list=PLkFD6_40KJIwfL-CQnMHVPI_QjlF8mW2O&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=CALESG-EECS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgvTQm-n0cI&amp;list=PLkFD6_40KJIwfL-CQnMHVPI_QjlF8mW2O&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=CALESG-EECS</a> . Not sure about next sem but historally this class has only 3 midterms and no finals.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) Adding 106A is also possible since the workload is also low-medium. The content itself is &#34;hard&#34; because most students aren&#39;t familiar with it initially but after a few weeks you&#39;ll get used to it and do fine. 2 midterms worth 10% and a large final project (40%) at the end instead of a final. The large final project is open-ended so whatever you put in is what you get out. Also a thing to note is 106A probably has the best curve out of all the EECS upperdiv (3.7 average) -- last semester most people was ~3.75. 106B is even more lenient at ~3.9 average. Basically if you put in the effort into this class, you&#39;ll probably do well.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) I haven&#39;t taken this class but I heard this class can vary in difficulty depending on your level of mathematics and how you did on CS70. Workload wise its just another weekly problem set class with some labs sprinked in here and here. I&#39;m not gonna comment on whether you should take it or not since I haven&#39;t taken it. Probably be wise if someone else can comment on this.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) Probably save the spot and take more upperdiv classes. I haven&#39;t had the need to use Math 53 in any of the upper divs in EECS apart from MAYBE a really tiny section 127 which you can probably google in 1 hour.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5) I would advise against this since 105 is somewhat of a medium-high workload due to the nature of the labs. Hardware debugging is a time sink and takes up a lot of your weekly time. There are also weekly problem sets, 1/2 midterms and a final, so its a decent amount of workload relative to 106A (maybe 2-3x?)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let me know if you want clarifications.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k1zl10wlpt9gd", "name": "Jessica Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["k1zl10wlpt9gd"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-04-23T04:29:17Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"11584": 6, "11911": 1, "12673": 9, "14591": 2, "14800": 7, "5769": 4, "5770": 0, "6947": 5, "7680": 3, "9822": 8}}, "created": "2021-04-23T00:24:45Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "lscs", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>My current fall 2021 plan is to take CS61c, EE120, and possibly a third tech?
