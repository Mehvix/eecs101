You will spend time on it. You will learn how to think differently and better. This is precisely why 126 is such a critically important course. It will *force* you to really understand probability better and this is why it is very important for people to take 189 *after* having taken 126. The fundamental understanding that 126 provides helps students understand the material in 189 much better. If taken in the reverse order, it is possible for students to develop &#34;bad form&#34; incomplete understandings of probability that will then need to be corrected in 126. Everyone benefits by taking courses in the correct\u00a0order.\u00a0\u00a0(ie.
