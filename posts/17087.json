Given the new enrollment policy, it seems that this summer will be the last chance for a non-CS major to take CS 162 (I'm in 61C this semester). \n\nNow, 61C was quite interesting, and upon further exploration/research I'd like to be able to at least try out careers like data engineering / ML Operations, even though being a data scientist was my end goal when I declared the DS major. \n\nI wasn't worried about 162 'till now since it's rarely needed for data science work, but if I ever do ML Ops or Data Engineering, will I need it? If it matters, I do plan on taking CS 161 / 186 (which are open to CS minors). If 162 will be necessary, is it worth to take it over the summer - with the opportunity cost being prepping for junior year recruiting (e.g. leetcode / learning new tech / project / doing well in my part-time internship)? \n\nThe alternate plan was taking some kind of online OS Course [like this one](https://www.educative.io/courses/operating-systems-virtualization-concurrency-persistence) for the conceptual knowledge but I'm wondering if not being able to put \"Operating Systems\" as a course I took on my resume will hurt me. \n\nThanks!</md>", "created": "2022-05-12T05:48:18Z", "subject": "How important is CS 162 for ML Ops?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l32laqt21ep3j7", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 17087, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538210093, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwupbl14eqmsc"], "tags": ["lscs", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 441}
