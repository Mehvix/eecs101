We cannot lower educational standards just for the sake of diversity.</p>\n<p>After you leave Cal, you will be expected to be one of the top computer science graduates in the country, having graduated from such a highly ranked program.</p>\n<p>Lowering GPA requirements is not the solution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>The solution is better education and support for students so that they are able to achieve these high standards.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been through lower-division classes, and I can understand why minorities may struggle. I believe the real problem is the <strong>lack of support, and the lack of structure in courses.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve seen so much cheating among students. I don&#39;t believe students want to cheat: they cheat because they <strong>don&#39;t have the skills or experience</strong> required to solve\u00a0certain problems.</p>\n<p>Students frequently\u00a0<strong>drop courses</strong> because they feel they are not prepared to do well for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem is the courses: <strong>we need to structure courses in a way that students with less experience can more easily catch up to those with prior experience.</strong></p>\n<p>We won&#39;t need to dumb down any standards of excellence. Midterms and final exams can still be the same level of difficulty. Same with homework, labs, and projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, when I took CS 70 this summer without any experience doing proofs, with little probability knowledge from AP Statistics, and some knowledge of calculus from AP Calculus BC, I had to spend significant amounts of time on my own to self-study the material. There is no textbook for CS 70, but there are the online notes, and some notes from other students; however, I felt these notes (plus content from lecture, which is very vague and not detailed enough) were definitely not enough to guarantee success in the class. I dedicated all of my summer to studying for this class, looking for resources and textbooks online so I could deeply\u00a0learn the material. Often times, I was reading the textbooks and notes from other universities on the same content.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I believe the course staff needs to provide <strong>more practice problems, more in-depth explanations, and more guidance</strong>\u00a0so students do not have to search for resources themselves outside of class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I understand that college courses are supposed to be challenging. But when you leave it to the student to succeed by themselves, you create the situation we have now, where students with better preparation (past experience, mentors, parents, private tutors) will succeed, and those without experience, whether it&#39;s because they come from families where their\u00a0parents aren&#39;t engineers or they don&#39;t have the means\u00a0to pay for private tutoring, will struggle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I also think\u00a0we are not providing this type of support for students because of the grading guidelines, where only a certain percentage of students can get a certain grade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If students had more support from the course itself (vs. outside help), then more people would do better on the exams, and more would get A&#39;s. But, why should this be a bad thing? Why are we discouraging all students from scoring high with curved classes?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Grading on a curve also creates more hostility between students. It discourages students with less experience from asking their peers for help, and it discourages the more experienced students from wanting to help less experienced\u00a0students. This doesn&#39;t make sense. <strong>Our goal should be for all students to achieve academic excellence. There shouldn&#39;t be quotas on how many students get a certain letter grade. Grading should be more objective.</strong> This will help eliminate the &#34;elitism&#34; that was previously discussed at a town hall. This will create a more supportive CS community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>I believe it is the responsibility of the school and the staff to restructure courses and reshape the community.</strong> Without this foundation of support from the course and staff itself, no matter how many supportive student organizations or peer\u00a0tutoring programs we add, there will still be this culture where those with less experience will struggle more. I think <strong>courses should be better organized, with more practice problems and more detailed notes</strong>, whether from free online notes or another textbook (which we should help students with financial difficulties purchase if needed).\u00a0I think we should <strong>reconsider grading using curves</strong>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And thank you to course staff for all of their hard work.

This will foster better discussions, as more included perspectives will allow us as a community to cover many more possibilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What we cannot do however is lower standards for the sake of diversity. The memo from Google casted a terrible blanket over a great amount of employees not only within Google, but the entire tech industry, causing them to think that others didn&#39;t believe they belonged their, despite of their great accomplishments and their hard work. Lowering standards for the sake of diversity will do nothing more to further this feeling, and will have a worse effect than the memo ever could have. Aside: I wholeheartedly believe that the GPA cap is unfair and a terrible metric to determine who is allowed to further their CS education, however we cannot pick and choose who has to abide by it, and who has the ability to bypass it; It has to be everyone or no one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Something that makes looking at current diversity statistics difficult to interpret is that we (or at least I) don&#39;t know the makeup of applicants. In CS, it is a little more difficult to get this, but for EECS, since we apply directly to the major, the University should have some knowledge of how diverse the applicant pool is. If only 1 in 5 applicants are female, then the 4:1 men to women ratio actually makes sense. If the applicant pool diversity significantly mismatches with the admitted population, then we have a serious problem at the University level. However, if the applicant pool is lacking diversity, then we have to find a way to get more members of minority groups to have an interest in CS so that they are more likely to pursue it. Personally, I believe that this is the core problem, and where we should spend the most energy in trying to diversify the CS community. If someone could point me to where I could find applicant statistics, I would greatly appreciate it!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If that is truly the reason why the CS community lacks diversity, then we still have the problem of trying to improve the experience of minority groups that are currently in CS/tech. I agree with the student response that those are great groups to look into, but that probably isn&#39;t enough. Not being in a minority group myself, I don&#39;t know how we can improve the experience. I would love to hear more ideas on how we can build a better sense of inclusion within the community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So yeah, that&#39;s my two cents on the topic. I definitely agree that this is a real issue, and that we as a community need to discuss it, but it is important that we find the actual root of the problem, and find a solution to that core problem, instead of simply trying to improve diversity by preferential treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: These are my personal thoughts on the subject, and in no way reflect the thoughts of UC Berkeley, or my current employer.
