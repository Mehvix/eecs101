It was definitely manageable but generally the first portion of CS 161 is a bit more of a heavy workload compared to the rest of the semester (which is the hot-recruiting time) so that&#39;s something to keep in mind. Just make sure to stay on top of material in both classes (work on projects, go to discussions, etc).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would recommend CS 162 &#43; CS 168 &#43; breadth or CS 162 &#43; CS 161 &#43; Breadth. Especially with CS 161 and CS 162 you&#39;ll find a good overlap in content (especially in the beginning). CS 168 is a light workload class which is a good class to take with CS 162 as they&#39;re in similar areas. Both of these schedules I mentioned above are some schedules I know where you&#39;ll learn a lot of material (so long as you&#39;re motivated and keep up with the material).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As far as CS 188 and DS 100 goes, in my opinion, there isn&#39;t much overlap. I took both courses and found that both courses had different areas of focus so I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about redundancy. If you are taking CS 189, you might find DS 100 teaches more high-level, and library-implementations of ML algorithms (at least that&#39;s how I felt about it).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope this answers your questions.</p>", "created": "2020-03-29T22:20:12Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "k8dlwztlzrq18m", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhlptryw67c", "name": "Andrew Shieh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvhlptryw67c"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-03-30T02:16:31Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k8ducwj6wloar", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "To the student&#39;s response above, would taking 162, 161, and 168 plus the 1 unit Ethics requirement be overkill?
