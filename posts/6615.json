Most people without prior internship experience do not get that many offers/interview requests (sorry for breaking it to you again, but it is the truth). This does mean you have to work extra hard to get the few opportunities that are available, but I wouldn&#39;t say its as time consuming as a class. Moreover, I strongly feel that most recruiting actually happens in the spring, not fall. Most companies hiring in the fall are the among the big ones including the Big4 and to be honest, it is hard to get their attention unless you are an exceptional candidate.
