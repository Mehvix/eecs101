For a comparison, I took 170, 188, and 186 with a breadth this semester and I found the workload to be completely fine. My relevant background for 189 is 70 (A&#43;), 16b (A&#43;), 16a (A) and 188 (grade not out but based on the grading bins A). I haven&#39;t taken 126, but I&#39;ve started to self-study the material, as well as getting a bit of a head start on the material for 189 (derivations for least squares, regularization\u00a0math, etc. so far). Originally I wanted to take 127 (or 126) before 189, but I&#39;ve read that 162 is pretty essential/core (I haven&#39;t decided if I want to go into ML or SWE yet, but I&#39;m interested in both), and I wanted to balance the workload between my semesters for recruiting/ECs while taking the most essential classes I could. I heard 127 is not as much work as 126 or 189, so I paired it with 162.
