It is a good balance of learning image processing fundamentals (filtering, 2D signals, compression, feature extraction, etc.) as well as seeing how these are used in computer vision research (via CNNs, object detection, image segmentation, image retrieval, etc.). Highly recommend this class for anyone wanting to get involved with computer vision research.
