The CS classes I have taken(is taking) include: CS170, CS188, CS168, CS186, CS161, IOS decal, Web Design Decal. And I have taken several math\u00a0and probability classes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0I am still planning for\u00a0classes to take for my\u00a0last semester. After talking to a lot of people and seen many Piazza posts, I realize that CS162 is one of the &#34;must-take&#34; classes here at Berkeley. The concepts in it are super important in industry. However, I absolutely hate CS61C. It is one of the worst experiences I&#39;ve had in my life. I hate\u00a0about coding in C or learning about low-level ideas. And it took me tremendous efforts to get only an A-. I took CS162 for a week this semester, and hw0 terrifies me. I ended up dropping the class.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0For my last semester, I am really conflicted inside. Part of me think that I should overcome my fear and pain to take CS162, because it is super important. And another part of me think that I should go for some classes that are less painful and more interesting and exciting for me, like CS184. I guess my question is, is it possible for me to self-study the materials in CS162 and still succeed in industry? Or should I do whatever it takes to survive CS162 in my last semester here?
