I&#39;m confident that I&#39;ll get the GPA requirement to declare CS, however I did not yet receive signature from my 1st major advisor for the double major application form and I am no longer in Berkeley to be able to speak with her. I am already enrolled in all of my classes for next semester and accordingly with my 4 year plan I am still able to graduate on time and in 4 years. Maybe it&#39;s not a big deal and it just sounds weird to me, but is it still fine for me to declare the double/apply for CS at the May 15th deadline as a junior 2nd semester student? Or would . I still be able to apply right now and have my advisor just sign it when the next semester starts? Thank you.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-12-15T16:02:11Z", "subject": "Declaring double as junior spring?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jb83qkpj7kx628", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5771, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550592839, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["cs-intended", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 410}
