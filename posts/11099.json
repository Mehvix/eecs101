First of all, when you register for the GRE, you get the option of getting two free computer practice tests from the ETS which are just past exams, so you can use that to prep. I would also recommend the official ETS book that is sold, since it contains two additional tests that you can use to practice. If you&#39;re a CS/EECS here at Berkeley I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about the quantitative section, just do a few practice sections so that you know what the expect. \n\nNow, for the verbal section, how you prep changes based on what score you&#39;re aiming for. If you want a 162&#43; you can just do all the practice sections in the 4 tests listed above and you should be fine; if you need additional practice questions you can check out other resources like Manhattan Prep&#39;s book of questions (I found it to be very helpful). If you want a higher score, 167&#43; say, then you&#39;ll need to study a lot more systematically, as in get GRE vocabulary flash cards and learn them. And by learn them, I mean seriously learn them since often you&#39;ll need to know what these words mean out of context for some questions. \n\nFor the analytical writing section, just look through the example essays in the ETS book for the GRE, and then just do a few practice essays. There&#39;s a whole list of past essay questions in the past on the internet, and the secret is really practice a lot. Its kind of like the SAT essay where the key to getting a higher score is to just write more (albeit write more that still logically consistent and mostly free of errors, just writing more garbage won&#39;t get you a higher score) and practicing really helps with it.", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-01-04T19:53:05Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10854": 7, "10958": 6, "10993": 9, "422": 0, "4426": 3, "4772": 8, "4817": 2, "5244": 4, "7412": 1, "8845": 5}}, "created": "2020-01-04T19:14:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["tutoring"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Not sure if this is the right piazza to post this question in, but I was wondering whether Berkeley offers any resources or tutoring services for getting ready for the GRE?
