So far I have taken CS 162, CS 186, CS 188, and am currently in CS 160 for the summer.

I would like to work in software engineering when I graduate and I feel like not taking CS 170 would leave me at a big disadvantage when I start looking for jobs. At the same time, Machine Learning is very popular right now and not taking that I might regret later as well.\u00a0</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The advising website for upper-division CS requirements suggests not taking 170 and 189 in combination so I am thinking if I try to switch, I will only switch one of my classes (probably 161). Full disclosure, I was enrolled in CS 170 last spring but had to late drop the class because I fell to far behind.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Can anyone offer any guidance on how to decide?</div>", "created": "2018-07-30T17:16:35Z", "subject": "What 2 final CS classes to take", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jk8jcmdhhxe1mf", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 7307, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548894764, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "lscs", "other", "peer_directed", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 636}
