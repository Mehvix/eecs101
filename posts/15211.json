How can you pull the rug out just two weeks before the start of the summer session? Many of us built our schedules for Summer and Fall around the expectation of a Summer PNP option. I know I&#39;m not the best CS student at Berkeley, so it was a relief to me to know that when I enrolled in CS 162 for this summer I would have the PNP option as a lifeboat if things go sideways. So now I&#39;m set to take a difficult course at double speed without the promised PNP option. Learning about this change so late I can&#39;t now simply defer CS 162 to the Fall since the course is totally booked at this point. Deferring to the spring is not an option for me either since I&#39;m set to graduate in the Fall.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As of June 6 the L&amp;S advising page ( <a href=\"https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/covid-policy-modifications/summer-2021-policy-modifications-and-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/covid-policy-modifications/summer-2021-policy-modifications-and-faq</a> ) says about Summer 2021:\u00a0 <em>&#34;Requirements within all College majors and minors may be met by courses that are taken P/NP during the Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021 terms. &#34;</em></p>\n<p>I understand that the College of Engineering has decided not to extend its P/NP policy to the summer. I understand that CoE plays a role in administering the CS major. But, special or not, the CS major is part of the College of Letters and Science and should be amenable to the Summer 2021 policy, announced in April, that L&amp;S describes on its webpage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, the summer courses are still going to be delivered remotely. In this regard, there will not be a meaningful difference in the student experience come summer. Whatever level of cheating or corruption of the curve that was present in Fall and Spring is apt to appear during the remote summer. Whatever difficulties and inconveniences of remote study--be it the difficulty of finding a suitable study space or working remotely in groups (as one must in CS)--will be no less real than they were in the Spring. It must have been for these reasons and more that L&amp;S decided to extend its PNP policy and so as CS students we should be allowed to take advantage of the policy that our college offers rather than be exceptionally excluded from using it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I wish the College of Engineering would reconsider this decision and I encourage any students who feels similarly to share their opinions with the L&amp;S advising staff: see <a href=\"https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/appointments-advice/ls-advising-staff-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/appointments-advice/ls-advising-staff-0</a> \u00a0(click on senior staff)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "k0cw0wobhov57q", "name": "Thi Huynh", "photo": "1598382758_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/k0cw0wobhov57q/1598382758_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6ij3zpc6by2nw", "name": "Weiyang Shi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzkuzbu2z5o6h2", "name": "Yueheng Xu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeuo00hhpg1im", "name": "Owen Long", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1612381622, "ke3aj8z75apb0": 1598377952, "kj9duntmc4w7ib": 1610069009}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kduq6vpl8qf71p", "name": "Anthony Le", "photo": "1598412003_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kduq6vpl8qf71p/1598412003_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kogqsnzoo6qk4": 1634181140, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1634968418_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1634968418_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1607541625, "kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1604956047, "kj9duntmc4w7ib": 1611606082}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbv9948cecj5io", "name": "David Chung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kdp84l41w3a3n2", "name": "Rohan Khandelwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1626121058, "kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1600028902, "kmyh2gvkzas66l": 1626123415}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaodmpndlol5yh", "name": "Aaron Lee", "photo": "1598298457_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaodmpndlol5yh/1598298457_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i57kqoj3c241tu", "name": "Hiroshi Usui", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr5giqs4wjp314", "name": "Lisa Sam Wang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrx2aetb3al", "name": "Kellyann Ye", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzgsrr9nvap3xn", "name": "Jacob Krantz", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jiet4ok81x65qy", "name": "Harold H.
