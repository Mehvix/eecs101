The main concern I have is I heard that cs189 in fall is more theoretical, and in spring is more application-based, and the curve is also nicer in fall, given that I learn a concept best when I know what exactly is going on in terms of math, and I&#39;m interested in research on areas of CV or neural network, I also perform better with harder homework and easier exams(because I have exam anxiety), in this case, should I take cs189 this spring or ee127 this spring &#43; 189 this fall(I can&#39;t take 189 and 127 together coz schedule conflict).
