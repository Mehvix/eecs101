MT1 I got about 1.3 standard deviation below the mean. Prior to MT1, I studied about 15 hours per week for the class, and this included going to discussion, doing homework, reading the notes..etc. But truthfully, I was being a little lazy about the process. Post MT1, I started pre reading. Meaning before lecture I would set aside an hour or so to go over the notes. Post lecture I went over the note again, but more carefully. When a homework was released I <strong>immediately</strong> began scanning it over. Not actually doing it, but just trying to understand what the questions were asking and what topics I needed to really understand. I didn&#39;t really do anything differently with discussions, but I know some people who found it helpful to attend different sections to find a TA that suited them. I increased my time spent to about 20-22 hours per week and started attending OH more frequently. I ended up getting 1.1 standard deviation above the mean on MT2 and got 0.7 standard deviation above the mean on the final.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, I had to drastically change my approach to the class.
