None of them qualified as an approved American Cultures course, apparently. My college isn&#39;t even listed under the &#34;Approved AC Courses at Other Colleges&#34; page.<br /><br /><br />As far as the petitioning process goes, it seems like the petition can only qualify 1 class per petition. So my question is, should I submit a combined petition for all 3 classes? Or should I submit 3 separate petitions at the same time, 1 for each class. My graduation timeline is fairly tight, so waiting for a singular petition decision is probably not a good idea, which is why I want to submit all 3 classes at the same time.</p>", "created": "2022-03-24T22:51:35Z", "subject": "3 American Cultures courses at another college", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "l15l9y6vdn71qj", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16663, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654538675500, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["faculty_advising", "lscs", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 262}
