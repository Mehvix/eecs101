The material is a bit different between the two classes but there&#39;s a lot of overlap:</p>\n<p>- 128 covers frequency-based control design and 232 doesn&#39;t really do so. In fact none of the ME/EECS graduate controls courses really cover Bode and Nyquist. ME 231A / EE 220B covers a bit in the last 3 weeks, but other than that I can&#39;t think of any other classes. In the past professor packard has taught a seminar ME 190L in the spring which covers some of these topics. If you choose to skip I would definitely take it.</p>\n<p>- 128 involves implementation on hardware, which 232 doesn&#39;t. If you want to do control I&#39;d recommend doing hardware implementation during some point in your undergrad. Other courses that provide this are EECS 106B, EE 192, ME 131, ME 136.</p>\n<p>- 128 also teaches much more &#34;usable&#34; control and gives you a pretty good intuition for PID, lead/lag, and general first and second order systems.</p>\n<p>- Meanwhile 232 is a much more theory-heavy course meant to shore up theoretical foundations of incoming grad students. There&#39;s a lot of mathematical background (linear algebra, etc) and a lot of focus on the state space. You learn controllability and observability in a much deeper sense, cover different topics like Lyapunov stability, luenberger observers, and do a lot of LQR.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>232 is much closer to EE 221A (linear systems theory) or ME 132 than EE 128. They&#39;re both pretty worthwhile and teach pretty different things. I really enjoyed taking 128 back in the day and still use the intuitions I picked up there all the time. I kind of wish I had taken EECS 221A over ME 232, since I already had a lot of coursework on LQR and didn&#39;t have much on ODE theory or LTV systems, but which one to take really depends on your previous coursework and what you intend to do. Both prof Poolla and prof Tomlin are amazing, so either would be worthwhile.</p>", "created": "2019-08-23T19:51:00Z", "subject": "", "uid": "i09a0mpvrV6"}], "id": "jzoj5kz9ibh2aj", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "is6p6uis14y5ot"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-08-23T17:34:25Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What is the difference between EE220a and EE128?
