It covers not only the highest(warehouse computing, thread-level parallelism, openMP) and lowest level of programming(RISC-V, circuits and registers), but it also teaches you how what cache REALLY is, \u201cintros\u201d you to memory management, and other miscellaneous concepts in CS like input/output, clock cycles, datapaths, networks, energy efficiency for warehouses.\u00a0<div><br /></div><div>It\u2019s the last of the 61 series and, in some sense, needs to include all the foundational, core computer science concepts that you would not have otherwise be aware of, outside your interested curriculum, be that in software, hardware, or theory. With that said, 61c fill in many many things and if you really get the most out of it, it\u2019ll excite you for what upper divs will teach you. Many people say they hate it because of how hard it is, but if you think about it, the class is essentially teaching how exactly your computer runs at a middle-level detailed level. You should really pay attention to everything without distractions, which could include R1B, but if the specific R1B subject matter is what\u2019s important, save it for the regular semesters. But if you\u2019re just trying to knock out some requirements, maybe take it at Berkeley Community College for minimal effort so you can spend your time on things you care about(if possible because I don\u2019t think BCC allows out of state students). The grade doesn\u2019t affect your gpa and you get the transfer credit.
