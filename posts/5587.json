While science is the thematic point of departure of speculative fiction, the concerns of this course will be the literary. How does literature&#39;s encounter with the projected realities of the new biology revise our conceptions of the subject? Could there be a Leopold Bloom of the genetically engineered, a subject whose interior voice is the free-flowing expression of experience? Behind the endless removes of social, material, and technological mediation lies the construction of a flesh and blood body, separtated from itself through the workings of consciousness. If indeed the post/modern subject requires a psychic space shaped by the authenticity of &#34;being,&#34; a consciousness deeply rooted in the human experience, then how do we represent that being whose point of origin is the artificial, the inauthentic? These are some of the questions to be addressed in this course. You may of course bring others.\u00a0 (Course #: 41411)</li></ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>", "created": "2017-11-17T20:07:49Z", "subject": "WEEK 13: Undergraduate Announcements", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ja4c6ltp35lvv", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5587, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550794490, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["announcements", "cs-intended", "eecs", "events", "instructor-note", "lscs"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 549}
