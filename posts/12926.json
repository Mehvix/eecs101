CS170, in that sense, is a lot similar to CS70. Personally, I have found CS61C really fast-paced, so that is something to take into account that if you want to take CS170 instead of CS188 you will need to reserve sometime for both 170 and 61C. A lighter CS class you can take is perhaps CS160.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-08-18T07:57:11Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11058": 9, "11584": 3, "12151": 1, "2232": 2, "3509": 4, "3551": 0, "6538": 5, "6721": 7, "6768": 6, "6965": 8}}, "created": "2020-08-18T06:20:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello everyone, I need some recommendations related to technical electives.
