For someone who wants to root in communications/control (which in the modern day going forward at the bachelor&#39;s level also *includes* signal processing and, critically, optimization and machine learning), the three most important breadth courses are probably (in order)</p>\n<ol><li>149: embedded cyberphysical systems. This is a core software engineering course that hits many of the skills involved in actually putting together a real system that interacts with the physical world.\u00a0</li><li>151: digital design. This is a core circuits course that makes sure that you understand what is involved in actually realizing very high-performance designs by leveraging hardware appropriately. To really hit this area, you should probably take the 290 course that builds on 151 and talks about VLSI realizations of signal-processing/communication/machine-learning. That&#39;s where you will see how the realities of implementation constraints force engineers to actually rework the algorithms themselves to function much better.</li><li>105: microelectronics. This is a core analog circuits course at the intro level. If you don&#39;t know this, you will have a hard time even following any conversation that engages with the analog constraints. But again, it is at the 142 level where this really gets you over the hump to be able to meaningfully participate in serious\u00a0design conversations around communications in particular. This particular breadth is more important for communications, and secondarily for control. The interesting thing that most people don&#39;t realize is that understanding how op-amps work and the like actually involves understanding more control. So courses like 140 actually can deepen your understanding of control.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other breadths like 162 (operating systems) are also important.\u00a0Classes like 130 provide nice cultural context, but aren&#39;t nearly at the same level of importance as those listed above or 162.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fact that OP didn&#39;t list 127 and 189 shows a gap in the technical core for someone interested in comm/control.
