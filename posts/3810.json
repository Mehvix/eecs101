As an EECS major, I know I was supposed to take 16A in the fall, but my advisor gave me the impression that there was no rush to begin the 16 series, so now I&#39;m a semester behind, but trying to catch up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For sure, I&#39;m gonna take 70 &#43; 16B in the fall. My question is, what should I pair with it if I want to take a third tech? I&#39;m really interested in maximizing how many upper divs I take, so I was leaning towards taking 61C as it&#39;s the last &#34;gateway&#34; class, but from what I&#39;ve heard, the combo of 70 &#43; 16B &#43; 61C is a pretty big\u00a0workload. I&#39;ve heard that 188, which as a smaller workload, is possible to be taken alongside\u00a070 (even though 70&#39;s a prereq), but is not recommended. Every other upper div essentially builds on 70 or 61C so I can&#39;t really take those. Any advice on what to take? Would Math 110 be beneficial since I haven&#39;t taken 54 to solidify my linear algebra since I&#39;m learning it strictly through the 16 series? Are there any CS/EE/Math/tech courses people can recommend to prepare me for upper divs or just because they&#39;re interesting?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>P.S.
