I know 105 allows alternate finals but 170 doesnt since I emailed to ask when originally I was interested in 105. I also emailed the professor in 120 and he said the class doesnt have a final exam \u2014 theres 3 midterms instead. Im guessing one of the midterm is the final before RRR week.

In general, I&#39;d recommend leaving special topics classes for after you&#39;ve found a niche through research and/or taking a few core upper-divs that you find really interesting. I was also in the position where 105 and 120 conflicted when I was planning to take them (never change EECS dept.), so I ended up choosing to take 105 and 130 instead. 130 is a really good class to take for anyone with an interest in circuits, device physics, and/or material science, and it complemented 105 well, since 105 has a portion dedicated to basic device physics. 130 also probably has the easiest design project of any design course, so that was nice as well. That being said, 120 is probably the most generally useful class in EECS after 126 and maybe 170, and I really regretted not having taken it by the time I got to 140 (the analog circuits class after 105). So, if it&#39;s at all possible, I&#39;d recommend taking 120 with 105, although it might make for a slightly tougher semester than taking 130 with 105.</p>", "created": "2020-01-02T02:35:51Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "k4w4asqthw3s5", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10797": 3, "10941": 2, "2272": 9, "2426": 5, "6284": 6, "6528": 0, "6953": 1, "8507": 7, "8824": 8, "9731": 4}}, "created": "2019-12-30T02:54:09Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed", "enrollments", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Currently enrolled in CS 170, 188, &amp; EE 105, but having second thoughts about 188 (not super interested in math side and I&#39;ve heard mixed feedback about necessity of the class).
