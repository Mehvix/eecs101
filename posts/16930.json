I remember at one point I had identical questions about PSD matrices on both my eecs 127 and CS 189 HW that week.

I was wondering if I should take 126 or 127 before 189? I've heard some people say that 127 and 189 together are a good combination since a lot of the material for both classes complement each other nicely but some people also said that taking 126 can give a good foundation on probability before entering 189. I've taken 70 and 16B this semester and have found the probability side of 70 to be quite interesting but I also enjoyed some of the linear algebra applications in 16B. I want to explore topics in probability in more depth but at the same time, I'm not sure if it will be better to take 127 concurrently with 189 in spring and take 126 in fall. I'd appreciate any advice on how I should go about selecting which class to take first.
