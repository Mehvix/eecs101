Why does one unit of 197 cost the same as one unit of 70?\n\nI understand that the system is implemented from the governmental side but there are numerous ways for the university to alleviate the pain. Even if it is not possible to reduce the requirement to 0.5 unit (which cuts the cost by half), why can't the university just set a different price for summer 97/197/99/199? Or perhaps reduce students' out-of-pocket amount in the form of subsidy or scholarship? There are so already so many variations of summer programs at Cal, including summer minors, that involves different pricing and scholarship giving, and I guess it is not that hard to do something similar to 197? Why cant the university cut the tuition by 300 for us, while it is paying a head coach 3000000 per year?\n\nUltimately I guess it is because we international students do not have a collective voice. Admittedly, some of us do not care about the $800 because of various reasons (they can afford it; they are paid in the internship anyways; etc.), but I believe there are many of us do care. The international students already paid quadruple in normal semester, and another $800 on summer means A LOT for some of us. My parents are going all out to support my study here by living by a painfully low standard, and $800 means 4 months of food for both of them. I am also trying to minimize expense of living here. For me, $800 means one month of rent or 2 months of food.\n\nIf anyone wants to organize or petition anything, count me in.</md>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2022-04-30T02:18:21Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10122": 6, "11204": 4, "1580": 7, "3427": 8, "6343": 5, "6471": 0, "6959": 1, "9443": 2, "9645": 3}}, "created": "2022-04-26T03:18:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m doing a summer internship as an international student, so I have to enroll CS197, which costs me $800.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This school is STEALING MONEY FROM ME!
