Rather than leave students to learn these skills on their own, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking attempts to bridge the gap between traditional computer science coursework and the industry recruiting process. With mock interviews and practice problems curated by frequency, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking provides a hands on and practical approach to learning how to code algorithms commonly seen in software engineering interviews.</p>", "created": "2020-11-18T00:21:39Z", "subject": "Leetcode 101 Decal: TA applications!", "uid": "jr1fa4dnd9r716"}], "history_size": 5, "i_edits": [], "id": "khmnuoahqdb6sg", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13720, "num_favorites": 5, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541913546, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jr1fa4dnd9r716", "name": "Katherine Wu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jgpxnxcksnw2pl", "name": "Michael Jayasuriya", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"k509eg2kx302ol": 1581487739}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jz9cv72l6vq6i9", "name": "Lewis Zhang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzve0soykzi6td", "name": "Harris Shadmany", "photo": "1579253922_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jzve0soykzi6td/1579253922_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j5swigc8gzd516", "name": "Heidi Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jyamq91ahbl5tz", "name": "Luis Navarrete Rios", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeunj65crw16a", "name": "Kexin Shu", "photo": "1599673100_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/kbeunj65crw16a/1599673100_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwv9tv79yyn5ok", "name": "Agam Jolly", "photo": "1568868584_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jwv9tv79yyn5ok/1568868584_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6lrx7lxeqz3e4", "name": "Tsai-Jwu (Judy)", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1602540126}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kd65gebmmj97kd", "name": "Adrian Serapio", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jr1fa4dnd9r716", "jgpxnxcksnw2pl", "jz9cv72l6vq6i9", "jzve0soykzi6td", "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "j5swigc8gzd516", "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "jyamq91ahbl5tz", "kbeunj65crw16a", "jwv9tv79yyn5ok", "j6lrx7lxeqz3e4", "kd65gebmmj97kd"], "tags": ["announcements", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 664}
