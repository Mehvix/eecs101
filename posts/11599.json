I haven&#39;t been able to find a syllabus for the summer session, and I would like to hear about other students&#39; experience in the class to decide if I should enroll or not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tldr: I want something to listen to during commute and was wondering if the homework/discussion takes more than 10 hours a week.
