Please do not request a room via bcal in Soda Hall yourself.</p>\n<p><br /> <strong><em>Step 3: Meet/email the CS Enrollment Manager </em></strong></p>\n<p>The CS Enrollment Manager is the person who creates the enrollment capacity for your class and designates how students will be able to enroll. You will work with the Enrollment Manager for any enrollment-related issues as well.</p>\n<p>Once the CS Scheduler has provided you with the section number and class number for your DeCal class, you can contact the CS Enrollment Manager to discuss how to handle enrollment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are three ways enrollment can be handled for a DeCal class:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Open enrollment</strong> \u2013 this is first come, first enrolled no matter who the students are. No priority is given by major, no distinction is made between lower div, upper div or grad students. This method requires the least effort on your part but also allows the least control over enrollment.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Permission code distributed by instructors</strong> \u2013 this is the most popular choice because it gives you the most flexibility and control. Enrollment is restricted to \u2018instructor consent\u2019 on Cal Central. You can then create your own enrollment form outside Cal Central to help you determine who should get into the class.<br /> <br /> The CS Enrollment Manager provides you with SINGLE USE permission codes that you can distribute to approved students. They use these codes when they enroll into your class.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Student-specific permission codes</strong> \u2013 this option prevents students from applying to enroll in your class and then giving the single-use permission code to someone else. <br /> <br /> This method is secure but rarely used because it requires you to provide a full list of students (names and SIDs) to your class to the Enrollment Manager within the first four weeks of the semester. The CS Enrollment Manager then generates the student-specific permissions and you then must notify the students that they can enroll into the class. </li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Step 4: Request permission to get teaching credit for your DeCal</em></strong></p>\n<p>To get teaching credit for your DeCal, you need to enroll into the CS399 section assigned to your faculty sponsor. To do this:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create a list of instructors/TAs who need this credit. The list should include names and SIDs.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provide and review this list with your faculty sponsor to ensure they know who they will be submitting grades for at the end of the semester.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Email the list to the CS Enrollment Manager who will then create student-specific permissions for you and notify you when you can enroll for credit.</li></ol>\n<p><strong><em>Step 5: Manage your DeCal enrollment/waitlist</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you have a waitlist for your class and want to drop students who have enrolled but haven\u2019t attended class, you can request a class roster from the CS Enrollment Manager to cross reference with your attendance records.\u00a0 The Enrollment Manager would need any list of students you wish to drop for non-attendance by <em>no later than 5pm Wednesday of the third week of class</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you plan to drop students for non-attendance, you need to have communicated (in your syllabus and/or the class website) from the beginning of the semester that this is something you will do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have additional questions?
