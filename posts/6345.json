So,\u00a0my focus has been a mix of SP and controls.\u00a0I have 2 more semesters left at Cal, and want\u00a0to try some Data Science classes and a mix of CS161, CS168, and CS186 if I can fit them in, and\u00a0plan to\u00a0take EE192 Spring 2019.\u00a0Career-wise, I want to end up at the intersection of software and engineering, ideally working in controls or applications engineering, but I also want to\u00a0be versatile enough to work in software, closer to the data\u00a0acquisition and analysis side of things. I consider myself at the center of both EE/CS in terms of my interests.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Does 149 seem like a worthwhile course for me, or might 162 round me out better by the time I leave Cal? The topics in 149 seem interesting, and from what I can\u00a0tell from the schedules/syllabi of both classes, there is some overlap\u00a0between them. But, I get the impression that 149 doesn&#39;t delve deep enough into many of its topics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Would really appreciate some guidance here.\u00a0I&#39;ve read all the other\u00a0posts about 149 on this piazza, but nothing has really touched on\u00a0the points I&#39;m interested in so I&#39;m hoping I could gain some further clarity here.
