The combination is quite tough, and you will find EE16B challenging even if you are good in the electronics side of EECS, simply because the course is very fast paced (especially once you are done with circuits) and covers a lot of material. I could not imagine having 61c on top of that. CS 70 is also as fast paced (maybe even more) as EE16B, and covers a lot of material too. Psets for EE16B this semester are due Thursdays and CS70s are due Friday. I would avoid adding 61c on top of that.

Like everyone&#39;s saying, 61C and 16B are very fast paced, and cover a wide range of topics. In my opinion, it is doable. Yet it would require a lot of focus and good time management. EE16B and CS70 have weekly problem sets. If you stay on top of the material and work on the problem sets throughout the week, you will be fine. In terms of workload, CS61C only has programming assignments and 4 projects. If you&#39;re the kind of student that reviews lecture material in advance, finishes assignments early, and is generally\u00a0on top of your academics, then you can definitely do it. If you are the kind of student that waits until the last minute to finish an assignment or study for an exam, then I suggest taking two out of the three classes you listed, like Rafael and Anon said above.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2018-03-28T20:57:58Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-27T23:44:14Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Anyone have any thoughts on taking EE16B, CS61C, and CS70 in one semester?
