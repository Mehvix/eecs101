I'd say since you're a sophomore you can start [reading](https://gre.economist.com/gre-advice/gre-verbal-section/strategies-non-native-english-speakers/boosting-your-gre-verbal-score-leisure-reading) now and take a couple of weeks to practice for the analytical writing portion in your winter break to take the GRE.

However, a poor GRE score can also immediately make you less appealing for admission.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the verbal portion, I just practiced using Magoosh flash cards on my phone when I had free time, and I got a 170. In my opinion, the verbal section is much easier to get a higher score on than the quantitative/math section just because STEM majors kill the quant section, while there doesn&#39;t seem to be such a saturation of high scores for the verbal section. I also read in my free time, though, just for the fun of it, so that might have given me an advantage.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t do any special preparation for the quant section other than a few complete tests and scored in the high 160s. I typically score relatively poorly on math standardized tests though, at least compared to the grades I receive in mathy classes. Another comment I will make is that the quant section is, from what I can recall, literally just SAT I math all over again, which also means that it is basically useless as an indication of mathematical preparation for any type of STEM graduate education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my opinion, the writing portion is the most challenging section. I&#39;d really recommend using the <a href=\"https://dxrgroup.com/scoreitnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ScoreItNow!(tm)</a> online practice tool for this, since a number of practice sessions come free with your GRE exam purchase and it allows you to see what a computer trained to score these tests thinks of your writing. I believe that at least one of the actual scores for your writing on the exam comes from this or a similar computer (there is also at least one human reader, I believe), so this should predict your actual performance decently. I ended up getting 0.5 lower than my average ScoreItNow!(tm) score. I think the key for doing well on the writing exam is to type quickly and be confident in your ideas, as long as there is some logic connecting them.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "name": "Zaynah Javed", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6xz4atuxp82ko"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-01-04T00:20:50Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2021-01-04T04:17:22Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kji1yuk3verpz", "subject": "<p>Again, the GRE doesn&#39;t matter much, but I&#39;d say that you want to have a score &gt;= 330 and an essay score &gt;= 5.
