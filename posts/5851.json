I just wanted to say\u00a0how\u00a0grateful I am for EECS 101. EECS 101 has helped us share our experiences with each other and connect as a community. However,\u00a0I&#39;ve noticed a degradation of conduct\u00a0toward each other, and\u00a0I would kindly ask you to consider a\u00a0few points about piazza etiquette. I hope we can all agree on these points:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ol><li><em>Please\u00a0remember to stay polite to each other.</em> There was a time when students could stay anonymous even to instructors, which certainly has benefits. However, the shameful trolling and name calling got out of hand at times so we lost that privilege. Even now\u00a0we\u00a0(and sometimes the instructors for that manner) are insensitive to each other.\u00a0This is coupled\u00a0with our\u00a0relatively low tolerance for constructive feedback/criticism which some of us perceive as threats/insults.\u00a0I know it can be challenging, but let&#39;s assume the best of each other.\u00a0I&#39;ve noticed several incidents on this forum where a student makes an emotionally driven,\u00a0strong comment\u00a0about an issue that needs attention, and many students here interpret it in a different way and\u00a0find it threatening/insulting. We need to have a higher tolerance and heed to students who have different perspectives, while\u00a0also speaking with a sensitive/moderate tone. If we all follow this philosophy, I believe we (not just as the EECS department, but the entire country) would be in much better shape. I understand that this is not possible in all situations, but\u00a0surely we can do better, can&#39;t we?</li><li><em>Please\u00a0elaborate your thoughts and opinions in the student answer box.</em> Students\u00a0sometimes leave extremely short comments in the student response field (like in &#64;3902, for example) which does not convey all that much information. Please try to elaborate your answers. &#64;3622 is a great example of a helpful student answer.</li><li><em>Please consider\u00a0the answers/opinions here as suggestions, not as fact/truth.</em> It is inevitable that there will be factual inaccuracies in the student responses, so make sure to always double check the responses. In the past few years here I&#39;ve seen many instances of advice that in retrospect I wish I had not followed (such as when to Phase I courses or which courses to take). I myself have given advice to students I wish I had not given, <em>and that&#39;s normal</em>. So you should just realize that some advice will lead you down a path you wish you had not gone down, so you should rightfully be skeptical of the responses here, <em>even if they come from an instructor.</em> This is not only the case here, but in life in general.</li><li><em>Please\u00a0look around for past\u00a0questions\u00a0related to your questions before posting.</em>\u00a0This helps\u00a0students\u00a0stay engaged and answer questions that are novel, rather than mindlessly scrolling through\u00a0questions that have already been countlessly addressed.</li><li><em>Please share your thoughts\u00a0an open-minded and thoughtful way.</em> Especially regarding course advice, the responses tend to be very definitive and forceful, in an effort to seem more trustworthy/credible. When I see this kind of behavior, I actually find it less credible. The truth is, we are a very diverse student body here with a wide range of skills and backgrounds. Sometimes there is no definitive answer and we should therefore consider presenting our opinions in a manner that is reserved/thoughtful. I found the student answer &#64;5756 to be a nice example of course advice that I hope maybe we all can follow.</li></ol>\n<p>There have certainly been instances when I myself have not followed the proper etiquette but I have recently\u00a0realized\u00a0how important it is and have taken steps to improve.
