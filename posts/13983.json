The lectures were even earlier, at 8, this semester. To be honest, the lectures didn&#39;t serve much purpose compared to the labs (I didn&#39;t watch a lot of them b/c of laziness and still ended with an A). But they are recorded, albeit posted kind of late into the week sometimes. However, if you don&#39;t have much SolidWorks experience, going the labs are your best bet for getting a good grade. The lectures give more of a practical approach to the real-life mechanical engineering side of CAD, whereas the labs actually teach you how to use SolidWorks, which is basically your final.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Altogether though, it&#39;s a very fun class, and the professor is extremely friendly.
