BFS and DFS in 61B are algorithms, think of them as search algorithms. Think of all the sorts as sort algorithms. Now think of techniques like &#34;divide and conquer&#34;. Well, what is divide and conquer? It&#39;s one of the topics you will learn in 170. But here is the thing...if you&#39;ve taken 61B, you can self study divide and conquer, and see that it&#39;s just something you can master through practice problems. Where do you get these practice problems in 170? By doing the HW. If you didn&#39;t take 170, how would you learn this topic? You would read a chapter, look at a youtube video, read an article, and do practice problems on leetcode or something.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, this is a very basic example of what you learn in 170. There are really complicated topics. DP is probably the most relevant to interviews. The code is 61B level, and so is the idea. As a result, your data structure, algorithm, and programming maturity is sufficient to watch a video, read a book/article to learn DP. Then, you can practice on Leetcode. How is this practiced in 170? You guessed it, through HW.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This self studying can occur with all the topics. They are not trivial, but you don&#39;t need to spend a semester studying the material. The reason I wouldn&#39;t recommend 170 for someone who simply wants it for interview prep is because of this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The HW is very difficult and time consuming. You want to interview prep, but you are spending hours not understanding how to solve 1 problem, 1 problem you don&#39;t have a solution for until you provide 1, and will be graded on for correctness. Then you will have to do a difficult project, and take 1-3 exams that will be quite difficult.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in the material, take the course. But if not, you can spend all those hours taking the course doing Leetcode. This is a better use of your time.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2019-05-08T22:29:06Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-10T04:57:44Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>It&#39;s a common misconception that 170 is a direct continuation of 70. It&#39;s much more similar to 61B. Many students who don&#39;t like the math in 70 are relieved by the pre-MT2 material of 170. For the most part, 170 has done an excellent job of extracting the math out of algorithms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think 170 is mandatory. However, I do think it helps with interviews. There is certainly some material that may show up but is not covered in 61B. Even if you don&#39;t end up using the algorithms we teach you, you will be more comfortable in algorithm design by the end of it. Of course, Leetcode and Hackerrank can be used to learn 170 material. This is why I think it isn&#39;t mandatory. But the comfort of being able to sit back and have the material handed to you in a sensible order is a good enough reason to take the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The project is a hit or miss, but I think this semester&#39;s was more of a hit than usual (I may be biased).
