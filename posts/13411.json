I took 61c with professor lustig, and I can confirm both of these professors are awesome too. I would advise you to take 120 ASAP, and if you like the material (ill be blunt, its a lot of math and can get kind of dry without application, which is the cool stuff imo), you can check out 123, and even some grad courses on stuff like stochastic signal processing, linear system theory (given you&#39;ve taken eecs126 or stat140, which I highly recommend if you want to go more into EE/EECS courses) and the like. Theres also a bunch of math classes that bridge some gaps that arent taught in these courses. As for AI/ML in these courses, im not so sure. There is probably some AI/ML applications in signal processing, but that might be more grad level stuff. Someone else who knows better than me can probably answer this.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>106a is one of my top 3 classes at this school. The course staff is the best ive ever had, and they have done their best to make the class as interesting as possible, even during COVID when we dont have access to the lab. Robotics is perhaps the most interdisciplinary of all the EECS topics, so there is something for everyone, including AI/ML people. 106b (which I am planning on taking next semester), is very different than 106a, in that it is almost entirely project based on research papers and the like that you read in the class. I will also give you a very important tip for 106a,\u00a0<strong>you dont need 120 for this class.\u00a0</strong>I know its listed as a prereq, but the course staff has been trying forever to get it taken off but for some reason cant. You can take 120 and 106a concurrently just fine, and being honest, I think you could take 106a and 16b concurrently. There is a lot of linear algebra in 106a, but nothing too crazy that i&#39;ve seen so far. This is important because 106a is only offered in the fall, so dont make the mistake I did and wait a year because you think that 120 is a prereq.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&#39;ve got the time remaining at this school, and decide to go all in on this stuff because you like it, you could easily take a bunch of grad courses in your last year.
