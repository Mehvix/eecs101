EE16AB are\u00a0enough to raise your mathematical maturity to the right level. Math 1B by itself is almost certainly not enough.

At the most basic visceral level, it is comfort in solving problems step by step and maintaining confidence in your work even as you take steps forward. For 70, you need comfort and familiarity with doing simple proofs and derivations as well. What we observe even in 16AB is that when students come in, many are so used to getting answers immediately (which is what so much of high school and standardized testing have primed you for) that they freeze up when faced with a problem that does not have an immediately visible path to the solution. Some students do one level better, in that they start trying random things but their confidence quickly dissipates as they take steps that don&#39;t land on the answer itself. Where you need to be emotionally (at a minimum) for 70 coming in is to maintain confidence, execute simple things correctly, be able to be precise in talking about concepts, and have some intuitive sense for when progress is being made. Learning mathematical maturity is sometimes kind of painful, but this is pain that you must experience to progress. The way that 16AB inflict this good pain upon you is forcing you to confront multistep problems that you cannot solve immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students should not rush into 70 prematurely or they won&#39;t be able to fully benefit from how it takes their basic sophomore mathematical maturity and forces them to rise to the next level (most visibly in being able to appreciate and do proofs that require strategy and not just tactics) --- the level that you need to be at to begin to grow in the manner that courses like 126 and 170 want you to grow.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-04-18T05:35:38Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j1n48iw37yu63g", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzab6kpr3c048h", "name": "Justin Luke", "photo": "1473540382_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzab6kpr3c048h/1473540382_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzab6kpr3c048h"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/16 - 4/22", "bucket_order": 156, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-04-19T05:59:02Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j1okigqa9f36q9", "no_answer": 1, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "Hello Professor Sahai, is it possible to schedule an appointment with you regarding CS70?
