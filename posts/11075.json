I&#39;ve been told that doing research as an undergrad is the best way to figure out whether I want to pursue a masters/PhD in the future. This past semester I started doing that, and I&#39;ve found the lab meetings where people present their work very interested (it&#39;s very ML/theory-oriented and cutting-edge research seems to interest me more than what I&#39;ve done in industry internships).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, within the research group, I myself have mostly been doing grunt work/basic Python coding, which is understandable since I am still an undergrad. The problem is that&#39;s probably not representative of what I&#39;d actually do as a grad student / in future research roles, and in fact it feels more similar to industry work where I&#39;m given a set of tasks and need to write code to accomplish it. From what I&#39;ve heard from professors/friends, this is what typical undergraduate research is like since we simply don&#39;t have the necessary background yet to tackle the open-ended and highly theoretical questions ourselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a result of this, I&#39;ve been second-guessing whether my interest in other people&#39;s presentations at lab meetings is actually an interest in academia, or just a surface-level curiosity for &#34;cool-sounding&#34; topics and unfamiliar ideas. I&#39;m afraid that if I do go into a PhD program, which would require committing 6&#43; years of my life, I might discover that I don&#39;t enjoy actually\u00a0<em>doing\u00a0</em>the research myself and that time would have been wasted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Basically, I enjoy the classes I&#39;m taking (where we&#39;re given math problems that have well-defined answers) and listening to others talk about their research, but I&#39;ve never gotten the chance to do open-ended, serious research myself and I don&#39;t know if I expect to before finishing undergrad.
