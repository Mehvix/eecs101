We aren\u2019t trying to be mean, we just want to check if this is the class for you. We have even been told the quiz should be even more challenging. This quiz is also for YOU to determine if this course is a fit for you. Not having the pre-requisites and trying to take our courses will set you up for a lot of grief. The current climate as made many students eager to learn programming which is great. But our courses do require pre-requisites. Please note just knowing the basic recursion is not enough to prepare you for our courses. We will stop taking new adds via telebears early 3rd week. So if you are considering switching courses do so before then.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Carol MARSHALL &lt;carolm&#64;cs.berkeley.edu&gt;</p>", "created": "2017-09-21T15:57:56Z", "subject": "", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "id": "j7un5osp3dr79q", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1ljbhi4b308", "name": "Monica Kumaran", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzd1ljbhi4b308"], "type": "i_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 9/17 - 9/23", "bucket_order": 150, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-09-21T16:25:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j7uo4n8cufu6uk", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Hi</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The enrollments are closed for Fall for 9E.\u00a0 We will be back in spring!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "hm0u5ggtpg5", "updated": "2017-09-21T16:25:06Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-09-21T06:43:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Hi!\n\nI trying to enroll in CS9E and it said that I needed an instructor permission.\nWhere do I go for the code?\nCan I sign up?", "created": "2017-09-21T06:43:32Z", "subject": "Enrolling in CS9E and CS9H", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "j7u3cqa56ru5gj", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5021, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654551322114, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 216}
