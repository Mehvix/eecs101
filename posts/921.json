However, some individuals also have an outdated bookmark for bCourses, which prevents successful login. Anyone still experiencing login problems should be able to resolve them by clearing their browser cache/cookies and logging in by visiting http://bcourses.berkeley.edu directly, rather than using a bookmark.\n\nUsers who still cannot access bCourses after clearing their browser cookies and cache and updating their bookmarks can bring their laptop or other device to 44 Dwinelle Hall between 9am-5pm, Monday-Friday, for support from an ETS staff member, or reach out for additional assistance by email (bcourseshelp&#64;berkeley.edu)\nclose", "created": "2016-02-07T02:59:29Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "ikbyob5lkti4yz", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-02-07T01:50:57Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>When I try to log in to bcourses, I keep getting a &#34;Failed to log in error message&#34; even though my username and password are correct (they work on CalCentral).
