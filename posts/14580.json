This is because, as you mentioned, whatever course you take over the summer you can devote your full attention to, and because you have nothing else in your schedule to conflict with, you can attend lots of OH for help if you need it. **I would recommend basing this decision on your background.** For example, for me personally I took CS70 over the summer (as opposed to any other CS course) because while I had a very strong programming background, I did not have any background in proof-based mathematics or probability, so I (correctly) reasoned CS70 would take more effort on my part to do well compared to a programming-based class.</md>", "created": "2021-03-23T21:30:13Z", "subject": "", "uid": "j6m3yw7hjf92b4"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kmmj7j2hep6no", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1598767367, "kaww3dlpw6n2fg": 1592868178, "ke3aj8z75apb0": 1599147200}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdjhlqvpz5kr", "name": "Brianna Fan", "photo": "1592769989_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzqdjhlqvpz5kr/1592769989_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1551343370, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548558104, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1574919273}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "name": "Priyans Desai", "photo": "1598406517_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjs6ge7urqc129/1598406517_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzqdjhlqvpz5kr", "jjs6ge7urqc129"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-03-24T13:30:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kmnhiwaa5176rj", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Honestly I think most people would get more out of 61BL than 70.

I cant imagine doing 70 at twice the pace in the summer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But 61B is annoyingly slow if you have programmed in Java before, and if you like programming and want to really get a solid way to understand data structures for internships then I think 61BL is a great opportunity as the instructors are super qualified to teach it and the projects give you a lot of experience (writing a deque, gitlet, and bearmaps per <a href=\"https://cs61bl.org/su21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://cs61bl.org/su21/</a> could give anyone a great way to spend their summer looking at the future) and the labs give you a lot of coding experience which you don&#39;t see in a regular 61B offering. Just because of the lab feature, I would recommend 61B summer, both are definitely hard but I think no matter how you do, you would walk away with more from 61BL</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "updated": "2021-03-24T13:30:50Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "seen": {"12151": 7, "13263": 2, "14497": 6, "3407": 9, "4317": 1, "6272": 3, "6601": 5, "6882": 4, "6946": 0, "9623": 8}}, "created": "2021-03-23T10:34:15Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hey!</p>\n<p>I have seen some discussions about this question, but I am not certain which one to take over summer.
