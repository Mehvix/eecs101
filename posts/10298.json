One thing to note is that Data 100 uses pandas and matplotlib directly, and this is the main issue in taking both classes concurrently: Both classes use and teach the same functions but for different libraries, so you will constantly have to switch between some function name/args that do the same thing but look vastly different. This will cause a headache and will prevent you from memorizing such functions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to take both, do data 8 and data 100 in separate semesters.
