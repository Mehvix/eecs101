Take Math 110 and learn the abstract theory about vector space. Note that the amount of knowledge you take away from math110 largely depends on how you learn math. Try to focus more abstract things presented in math110 because those things can take your further in almost any subfield of EE and CS. Linear algebra is not about matrix manipulation; in fact, you should be able to talk about all the concepts (except determinants) in linear algebra without referring to matrices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Learn through the application. Honestly, this depends on your interests. Personally, I learn more linear algebra from Fourier analysis (EE120), physics (Physics 137A/B), and control (EE128, EE221A or ME232). Your intuition increases gradually and in unintentional ways, which makes mathematical maturity a hard thing to train. If optimization and its related fields (ML, optimal control, etc) are what you want to pursue, I would also recommend math170, which goes in parallel with 127 and gives rigorous proof to everything in 127. Math170 also introduces some calculus of variations and optimal control theory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3.
