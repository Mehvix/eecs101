Somehow, this message seems to be getting blocked or somehow attenuated. It really is something that students need to help disseminate. There is a very good reason why EE16AB\u00a0are required, and Math 54 is not.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of your specific question, the easy answer is take EE16A. If you already know something, it will be ridiculously easy to do that problem on the homework and there is no loss from you doing that problem. If it takes you more than 15 minutes to do a HW problem, then you clearly don&#39;t understand it and benefit from doing it. The course is not curved so you are not being unfair to anyone. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another thing to do is just tune into EE16A lectures starting from last week. Come to the last couple of lectures. Can you understand what is going on and follow along?
