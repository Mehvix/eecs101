Examples, are transmission lines for MRI coils, or power / data cables for peripherals. Unfortunately it is not possible to use Ferrite Cores to block these currents \u00a0as they are magnetic and can not be placed in the strong magnetic field of the MRI system. Current solutions in industry use.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In our project, which is a collaboration with GE healthcare, we are designing \u00a0resonant, distributed devices that block unwanted currents on cables inside an MRI machine, to prevent Radio frequency burns to the patient.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We are looking for &#34;handy&#34; candidates, who are not afraid to build and test devices (even on a real-large size MRI machine)</p>\n<p>Experience in CAD design, 3D printing is advantageous.</p>\n<p>Experience in RF and electrical measurements is also a plus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please contact Miki Lustig <a href=\"mailto:mikilustig&#64;berkeley.edu\">mikilustig&#64;berkeley.edu</a>\u00a0 or Ekin Karasan\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:ekin_karasan&#64;berkeley.edu\">ekin_karasan&#64;berkeley.edu</a>\u00a0.
