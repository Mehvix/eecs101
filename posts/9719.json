B&amp;T is written exceedingly well and is designed for a course at MIT that covers the probability material in 70, followed by (approximately) the first half of 126, so you don&#39;t exactly start off with &#34;more advanced&#34; material. If you can do all of the example problems and basic exercise problems in B&amp;T on your own and can understand the solutions to the &#34;foundational&#34; starred exercise problems that pop up every once in a while, then I&#39;d say you are well prepared for 126. 126 goes at such a fast pace that I didn&#39;t ever find that I had the time to review concepts in the textbooks once the class actually started, so having this foundation in place beforehand was very helpful. Also, once the class starts, be sure to attend lectures, discussions, and office hours! Last semester, 126 was not webcasted, and falling behind on lecture (i.e. missing lectures) makes the class way harder than it needs to be. Office hours and homework parties in 126 were often empty this past semester, so definitely take advantage of those as well (doing homework with TAs to guide me helped me finish homework in about half the time it would have taken me otherwise, and ensured that I had misconceptions cleared up way before exams came around). Discussion sections would\u00a0often introduce useful proof techniques and conceptual material for homework and exams, so those were helpful too. Hope this helps!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2019-06-05T18:20:08Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-06-01T11:51:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "So I\u2019m taking 126 in the fall and my probability is pretty weak.\u00a0<div><br /></div><div>Just wondering if there were any tips people could suggest on how to study for this class so it isn\u2019t too difficult when I take it.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks!</div>", "created": "2019-06-01T11:51:17Z", "subject": "How to study for EECS 126?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "jwdggxw0u6n3iw", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9719, "num_favorites": 5, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546399149, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvh8i561k5t7", "name": "Warren Alphonso", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3l3z9ni3ff58o", "name": "Jason Xie", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvh8i561k5t7", "j3l3z9ni3ff58o"], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 685}
