I also set up a delayed swap in phase 1 as well.\u00a0 This means that in phase 1 i was enrolled in 12 units and waitlisted in 4 units. I know that swaps allow you to go past the unit limits of that phase. However during phase 1, when I tried enrolling into a class after setting up the swap, it did not allow me to enroll because it would go over the unit limit. I was able to enroll into the class first and then set up the swap for some reason. <br /><br />I want to enroll into a breadth phase 2. In phase 2 will I not be able to enroll into the breadth because it would supposedly &#34;go over the unit limit for phase 2&#34; even though the waitlist swap units should not count towards the unit limit for phase 2? Do I have no choice but to cancel the delayed swap, add the breadth, and then set up the delated swap again? Please advise. I would like to be able to keep the waitlist position that I have currently and not have to be at the back of the waitlist because of cancelling and then adding the delayed swap again.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2021-11-26T02:08:10Z", "subject": "Urgent Course Enrollment Phase 2 Question", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kwfqwdw4a8755q", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 16144, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654539238728, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "faculty_advising", "other", "peer_directed", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 232}
