A lot of professors encourage you to take notes by hand anyway. Also, having my laptop open during class distracts me too much. Some students find it helpful to take notes directly on slides or worksheets by using an iPad/tablet. If you&#39;re working in a lab, they already have computers there. My opinion is that I don&#39;t think instructors should be allowed to require a laptop for any class. There was a month where my laptop screen broke, so I had to plug in my laptop to a library/lab computer&#39;s monitor in order to use my laptop at all, or Moffit&#39;s laptop lending was super helpful but often had limited availability.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-05-11T02:22:31Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-05-11T20:01:24Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kokgm1vsmey319", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>For lectures or discussions, laptops aren&#39;t necessary by any means. Generally, discussion worksheets are printed out by course staff and given to you in section to work on by hand, and, obviously, you can just take notes in a notebook for lecture. The instructional labs and computing spaces on the first floor of Cory will generally have all the software necessary to run simulations and write reports for EE labs. That being said, it can be more convenient to run simulations on your laptop, either through downloaded software (e.g. MATLAB or Python) or through a remote desktop client (e.g. X2Go or NoMachine). Many circuits classes use proprietary, industry-standard simulation software that must be accessed through institutional machines, so using a remote desktop client can be convenient if you don&#39;t want to only be able to run simulations while physically sitting in Cory.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpbl6kvl2aq", "name": "Rohin Tangirala", "photo": "1600201004_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnpbl6kvl2aq/1600201004_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnpbl6kvl2aq"], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2021-05-11T20:01:24Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"1038": 4, "1547": 7, "1549": 2, "2887": 1, "3133": 6, "4906": 3, "5402": 0, "602": 5, "6528": 8}}, "created": "2021-05-11T02:09:13Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is it necessary to bring laptops to classes?
