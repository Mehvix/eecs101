The content that physics 89 teaches can vary largely from semester to semester. For example, when I took it with Ganor in fall 2020, the class really focused on solving differential equations, and we basically got none of the topics that physics 89 typically advertises for, which is tensors and infinite dimensional basis. Furthermore, physics 89 might not give you a great linear algebra foundation. People complain that EECS 16A teaches linear algebra too quickly by going through it in 4 weeks. My physics 89 class managed to go through everything in 2 weeks.
