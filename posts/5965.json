There&#39;s only 5-6 PM sections that are still open in 61C, so I can&#39;t switch that section to a different time. I submitted the conflict override Google form, but I&#39;m concerned because I dropped 188 and tried to re-enroll into an open discussion section and am now #181 on the waitlist for CS 188. I know some\u00a0people got off the waitlist for 188 by dropping &amp; re-enrolling but I&#39;m not sure if my time conflict and new waitlist position will affect my chances of getting into the class? Can anyone clarify this?</p>", "created": "2018-01-09T22:59:12Z", "subject": "CS188 Waitlist &#43; Time Conflict", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jc88n5vum8y3n0", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 5965, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654550369028, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is471vtydc72si", "name": "Zitong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgxzlyys5i2", "name": "Jonathan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is471vtydc72si", "jktvgxzlyys5i2"], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 392}
