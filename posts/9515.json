I\u00a0am thinking about which of these two courses to take along with 61B &#43; 170 next fall, plus recruiting. I&#39;ll most probably take Data 100 on later semesters, so I think I won&#39;t lose the chance to study the materials for data 8. So, I just want to have an idea about which of the two courses is more easy to get a A lol. I\u00a0expect that data 8 is easy after taking 61A and 70, but the berkeleytime shows that astron C10 actually has a higher A rate (41% vs 32%). Does Astron C10 requires lots of memorizing, like some humanities courses, or is it more like a physics course? Thanks!</p>", "created": "2019-05-04T05:33:43Z", "subject": "Data 8 vs Astron C10 difficulty comparison?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jv92njupfr241d", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9515, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546700815, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhopc26l6a8", "name": "Laiming Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhopc26l6a8"], "tags": ["peer_directed", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 229}
