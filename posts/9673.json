Retire at 66. Life is long. Missing college experience is not relevant, you can experience stereotypical college things in just 1 weekend. But with the 3 years you have, that\u2019s more than enough to do a lot of things. But there will be parties after college, going out with friends, and really, everything you do in college. There won\u2019t be a dense area of your college friends after graduation, but 3 years is plenty of time to enjoy seeing friends around school. Good friends will probably be free at least once a month post grad to hangout and have parties or dinners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>stay an extra year and you can take more classes, do another internship, travel more, or you can start working and self study classes, travel on PTO. It doesn\u2019t matter long term, unless you have your own specific pros and cons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>you might be 55 and wish you did 4 years of college, but I think that\u2019s not the best mindset to have anyways. Normal mindset, but 3 years is such a long time to experience college, no need to compare with others who do 4 or more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ill reiterate, you can party and do other college things after graduation. In terms of being a student researcher and TA, I think you\u2019ll have to be a student. You can intern after graduation too, I\u2019ve seen it happen.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-05-26T01:35:04Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-05-25T00:45:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just wondering if anyone has\u00a0insight on the topic.
