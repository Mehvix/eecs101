I got a B- in CS 70, a B in EECS 16A, and EECS 16B rn is definitely pretty challenging. I would probably be taking Data C100 alongside CS 189, in addition to UGBA 147 and UGBA 106 (UGBA classes in general are usually very manageable when compared to EECS/CS classes in my opinion, so I am not too worried about these).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I wait to take it with Sahai in Fall 2022, by then I will have also been able to take Data C140, Data C100, and Math 53 as additional preparation (I also may or may not take EECS 127 alongside 189 in Fall 2022 if I take 189 then). However, I have heard that 189 with Sahai is extraordinarily challenging, so I am thinking that 189 with Shewchuck (without Math 53, self-studying the relevant parts) might be more manageable that 189 with Sahai, even if I have been able to obtain additional preparation through Math 53 and Data C140?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please respond ASAP y&#39;all, my course enrollment time is very soon.
