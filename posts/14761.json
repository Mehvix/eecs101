I think most established tech companies would be flexible with start dates, and it ultimately comes down to whether you want to start working/earning money sooner, or if you want a half a year break to recharge/recover after 4 years of Berkeley grind :).

We definitely both thought that the other was crazy..

One is, for full-time recruiting, how much flexibility do I have in deciding when I get to start? I know it probably depends on the company, but do I get to choose when to start or do they decide for you? And for fall graduates - what is the timeline usually like?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second is, any opinions on whether I should take time off or start working immediately?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks :)\u00a0</p>", "created": "2021-04-18T01:05:04Z", "subject": "When to start full-time job after graduating in the fall?", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "knmgw4muxot65a", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 14761, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654540759539, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6gwtu1da1dz", "name": "Akshara Majjiga", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdinqsfte4mw", "name": "Kaixiang Zhang", "photo": "1567010159_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzqdinqsfte4mw/1567010159_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6congzb11855f", "name": "Lily Bhattacharjee", "photo": "1566840155_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6congzb11855f/1566840155_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhipdm1r63s", "name": "Carolyn Duan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jykoiw12p0p400", "name": "Prachi Deo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfls32zr4h7", "name": "Jonathan Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfivqsei4f2", "name": "Nicholas Berberi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kcc3ysvjvev2lc", "name": "Vedha Santhosh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh19bukde2t2", "name": "Zeyi (Jackson) Yan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3nrz5qj7ff4j8", "name": "|||", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jjs6gwtu1da1dz", "jzqdinqsfte4mw", "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "j6congzb11855f", "jktvhipdm1r63s", "jykoiw12p0p400", "jktvfls32zr4h7", "jktvfivqsei4f2", "kcc3ysvjvev2lc", "jzdh19bukde2t2", "j3nrz5qj7ff4j8"], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 443}
