But L&amp;S CS students have the option to take something else (at least juniors and seniors do), and can take Math 54 instead of 16B. Meanwhile, many non-EECS engineers who can&#39;t take it literally cannot take other required classes or fulfill their desired concentrations. MechE&#39;s have (at least) 102AB, so at the minimum they have to take 16A as juniors, or they cannot graduate. And that&#39;s if they aren&#39;t concentrating in controls or MEMS or something. BioE&#39;s doing any sort of medical device stuff have to take 16A, and likely 16B before they can do half their upper divs. Ditto for energy engineers or engineering physics majors who want to do power systems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even if they don&#39;t/can&#39;t take an alternative to 16A, CS majors only need to take it their very last semester in order to graduate (and I remember the CS department helping seniors with that last year). I haven&#39;t met a CS major yet who has wanted to go into the EE side of things, and while they probably exist, most CS majors don&#39;t actually need 16a until their last semester. Maybe they could do a petition system where CS/BioE/EnergyE majors who wanted to do EE-related upper divs would get priority, but otherwise, giving CS majors priority would be akin to shoving out most of the engineers who actually need it (seeing as the CS major is twice the size of all non-EECS engineering majors that would need 16A combined...)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "i09a0mpvrV6", "updated": "2016-08-03T21:42:18Z"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 7/31 - 8/6", "bucket_order": 193, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-08-03T21:55:39Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "irffn1xm2jb5ho", "subject": "<span style=\"background-color:#fff\">Rather than setting up a petition system for specific majors, I think everyone who needs it for their major should get equal preference and a petition system should be set up specifically for any person of those majors to get special access to the course through CCNs for the purpose of taking future courses. This process could be advisor-facilitated. I think this may be more efficient because there are a lot of EECS majors who take the CS route and don&#39;t necessarily need it early on either, so it doesn&#39;t make sense to blindly put all of EECS before CS.
