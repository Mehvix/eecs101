I want to Pass cs70 &amp;/or eecs16b so that only my 61a grade and 61b grade are taken into account for the major and hence, I will qualify for CS because the gpa is &gt; 3.3. How do things change for the CS major now that LS is P/NP? Can I do what I said I wanted to do and will it work the way I said it will? Do I pass eecs16b and cs70 or just 1 of them (Maybe I pass cs70 but take 16b for letter grade and they count 16b towards my gpa or vice versa)? Will they count my grades in cs70/eecs16b regardless of P/NP?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>", "created": "2020-11-05T21:56:26Z", "subject": "CS Major", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kh5ddpauor56dh", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 13623, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654542020570, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kag9wdymr471kd": 1593538286}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaioi8mt8jb3ij", "name": "Devin Ghumman", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdir7p8274pi", "name": "Mahir Behl", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["kaioi8mt8jb3ij", "jzqdir7p8274pi"], "tags": ["cs-intended", "lscs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 652}
