Being wait listed (even within the 10% attrition range) does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class. The higher your wait list position, the more I encourage you to consider taking an alternate class in F19 and trying again to enroll for Data 8 in SP20 semester.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you choose to remain on the wait list, you are welcome to do so.
