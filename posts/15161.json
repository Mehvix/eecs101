What I mean to say is, most ML internships that would be available to you would be a lot of data crunching and data cleaning, with just a little bit of ML or deep learning sprinkled on top. Even if you have that researchy experience it can still be hard to find a purely ML internship since most of those are available to masters &#43; PhD students. If you know for a fact you don&#39;t like low level/systems programming, then postpone 61c. But if you&#39;ve never tried it before, I would recommend taking 61c sooner rather than later so that you get a feeling of system programming before you finalize your decision to follow the ML path. At the moment, your fall semester looks a little busy and each of those techs are individually more difficult than any of the techs you&#39;ve taken so far (maybe with the exception of 188). If you&#39;re serious about doing a summer internship, I would recommend lightening your fall semester a little bit so that you have the opportunity to push harder on recruiting", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "name": "Zaynah Javed", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6congzb11855f", "name": "Lily Bhattacharjee", "photo": "1621442647_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j6congzb11855f/1621442647_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kbua2f04n1051c": 1594933377}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdiymttub4tw", "name": "Neeraj Shenoy", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6xz4atuxp82ko", "j6congzb11855f", "jzqdiymttub4tw"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2021-05-23T19:46:27Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "This week", "bucket_order": 5, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-05-23T21:35:17Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kp1p90li72m3o8", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p></p>\n<p>I think doing CS 61C does open my eyes to some parallelism topics that are important in the study of faster computation methods that happens in Machine Learning, specifically Scientific Computing</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do you need to take CS 61C to know about this?
