IMO at least for unpaid research, the importance of GPA is more overrated than not. The importance is that you at least learned the core topics and concepts from those courses and can apply them in the research domain, which taking them and passing with an average grade or above is usually indicative. Then it's just a matter of commitment and interest from both sides. If I had to answer your question directly, yes, it would compensate for your more average lower division grades too. The level of abstraction and thought at reading, analyzing, and constructing research-level literature is much more similar to your upper division coursework than your lower division coursework. Also, you will usually find less research related directly to your lower division coursework because it is so essential and foundational (like arithmetic in math, only super theoretical stuff arises). </md>", "created": "2022-01-18T21:38:29Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jktvi3jvtj6pm"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kykn1ki7otr1ld", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kae5mj1snlw61y", "name": "Sharvil Trifale", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["kae5mj1snlw61y"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"10651": 3, "12416": 8, "14098": 5, "14707": 0, "16175": 7, "16251": 2, "4657": 4, "5424": 1, "7809": 6, "9373": 9}}, "created": "2022-01-17T14:37:30Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["research", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>If someone has done average in the lower divs (B-&#39;s, B&#39;s, B&#43;&#39;s) for EECS and is planning to possibly get A&#39;s (or A-&#39;s) in upperdivs like 127, 126, and 189, would it compensate for the lower grades in the lower divs for being accepted for one&#39;s first research in any AI/ML research group?
