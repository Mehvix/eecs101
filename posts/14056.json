Labs must be attended synchronously but other duties can be completed asychronously. The lab will be made available to you in advance and will be accompanied by a walkthrough video (ft. me) which will be much more revealing of the solution than resources allotted to the students. You are required to complete it and submit labs to Gradescope in preparation for your lab.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For your time and effort as an Intern, you will be awarded 1 unit of PNP credit for the Spring 2021 semester. Completing all of the above bullet points will get you a P. <strong>You cannot become an intern without taking the class for a unit.</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://forms.gle/t8uCwqxa421J3hyg7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Application is Available Here</a>. It is <strong>due Tuesday, January 12th, at 11:59pm PDT</strong>. Expect decisions before the semester starts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here are some common questions I always get about applying to be an intern:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do I need to have gotten an A in 61B to apply?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the application process is grade blind. You are selected based off your answers to the application questions. Potential applicants often express to me that they do not feel &#34;qualified&#34; for the position and they always are. This is as much as opertunity for you to learn the material a second time as it is to get teaching experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>I am undecided if I want to apply, should I?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are considering becoming an intern but unsure if you can commit to it, I would recommend filling the application out anyways.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What times are available for labs?</strong></p>\n<p>This will not be decided until closer towards the semester. Labs are normally W-F. Take a look at <a href=\"http://fa20.datastructur.es/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last semester&#39;s website</a> to get an idea what the shedule might look like.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please comment below with any further questions or email me at alexschedel@berkeley.edu if you have any more personal questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>#pin</p>", "created": "2021-01-02T19:31:21Z", "subject": "Intern for CS61B in Spring!", "uid": "jcaul3qcivh6kh"}], "history_size": 4, "i_edits": [], "id": "kjg3qip9ptgpg", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 1, "nr": 14056, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541540143, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jcaul3qcivh6kh", "name": "Alex Schedel", "photo": "1629854756_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jcaul3qcivh6kh/1629854756_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdj7emy1757z", "name": "Eric", "photo": "1567038091_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzqdj7emy1757z/1567038091_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jz3hxjj9pty72p": 1569732530}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzkb6usfpbg144", "name": "Nicholas De Leon", "photo": "1630870453_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzkb6usfpbg144/1630870453_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kbesvacrkom2of": 1593053461}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kbeun6isbr4xp", "name": "Nikhil Kandkur", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1612381622, "ke3aj8z75apb0": 1598377952, "kj9duntmc4w7ib": 1610069009}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kduq6vpl8qf71p", "name": "Anthony Le", "photo": "1598412003_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kduq6vpl8qf71p/1598412003_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1634974210, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1594950095, "ksxpylctdzq66": 1634974002}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaamqk4tvrk5lg", "name": "Eric Che", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1567211949, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1548611054, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1567647586}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "name": "Aishani Sil", "photo": "1603429714_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jjzd0ebjf50lh/1603429714_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"k5kga9pwx0l754": 1585015759}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnol2ip9j1p9", "name": "Tony Kam", "photo": "1610140270_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnol2ip9j1p9/1610140270_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzqdhs0v5c944c", "name": "Richard Privalov", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kcqjit2ulgf60r", "name": "Arvind Rajaraman", "photo": "1633500531_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kcqjit2ulgf60r/1633500531_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jip1ye5zsh511j", "name": "Haley Shih", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvh4eczew5p4", "name": "Linda Deng", "photo": "1629526994_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvh4eczew5p4/1629526994_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jcaul3qcivh6kh", "jzqdj7emy1757z", "jzkb6usfpbg144", "kbeun6isbr4xp", "kduq6vpl8qf71p", "kaamqk4tvrk5lg", "jjzd0ebjf50lh", "jzlnol2ip9j1p9", "jzqdhs0v5c944c", "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "kcqjit2ulgf60r", "jip1ye5zsh511j", "jktvh4eczew5p4", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "tags": ["announcements", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 1303}
