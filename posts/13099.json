The skills you learn from internships cannot be taught in a school setting, whether that is dealing with your employer, etc. Also what you learn education wise too is much different than that taught in school setting. In my summer of freshmen yr I applied for an internship at a very small company and didnt think i would get it since it was not my major. Suprisingly I ended up getting it. I didnt like it too much. It was kind of slow and I felt like I wasnt doing much. It was a summer internship and I was gonna stop it after summer anyways. They decided to extend it for a whole year looking at how much time and effort I was putting in. I said yes because I became a big part of their team. I definitely did not learn in terms of my major but I learnt a lot of professional development skills, etc. And I got a clear understanding of what I wanted from my next internship. As for joining clubs, please do but again i dont think clubs are comparable to an actual internship be it small or big.

If you&#39;re pretty quick with applications (I&#39;m personally not, they stress the hell out of me) then yeah maybe it&#39;s not a big deal, but if they take a lot of time it might be better spent studying more for your classes, joining clubs on campus, grinding on leetcode, learning some additional skills online that you wouldn&#39;t learn in class, etc., in other words things that improve your standing for employers in the future and also just make you a smarter person in general. Plus if you mass apply and happen to end up at that one company that admits you, who says you&#39;ll enjoy the work that that company employs you for? In my opinion better to improve your marketability and then maybe you&#39;ll have more choices in the future.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "jzdh11fe3ui2kw", "updated": "2020-09-04T06:14:38Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-09-05T20:50:09Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "keq55hnr347fl", "subject": "<p>thanks, I will look into it!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "kdx6ko9ssli6ns", "updated": "2020-09-05T20:50:09Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-09-05T07:59:59Z", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kepdn1ruvs321s", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>you can look into the e98 decal for help getting started with resume career fairs LinkedIn and all that</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2020-09-05T07:59:59Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"12063": 9, "12772": 2, "1537": 7, "1844": 6, "2219": 4, "468": 3, "5769": 1, "5770": 8, "6947": 5, "9806": 0}}, "created": "2020-09-03T20:27:57Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I am a freshman at the College of L&amp;S with CS as my intended major.
