Now, onto the perspective of getting the most out of the course: The biggest thing you are lacking not having taken Stat 135 is a lot of the basic terminology\u00a0and the way of thinking of stats people. Amongst these is working knowledge of confidence intervals, hypothesis and significance tests, errors in estimation, and bootstrapping. The big benefit you have on your side is that all these topics are covered very cursorily in Stat 135 (from my understanding) and it is not till Stat 210A that the theory behind these ideas is covered at all. If you have invested time and effort into EE126, then you have (probably) adapted to a (semi)\u00a0theoretical way of approaching problems, and this allows you to pick up these topics a beforehand\u00a0from a well-suited textbook, and be able to follow along the course of your choice (say 153) well. However, do note that it is key that you pick up working knowledge in these\u00a0topics\u00a0as you go along, because without that you might\u00a0get a good grade in the class, but miss out on many key takeaways that the course can offer you (for example: when forecasting using ARIMA models, what methods are most useful for which specific cases and so on). Further, this means that you will have more work than the rest of the class (however, I will point out that in my (perhaps biased) opinion, the workload in this class was substantially lesser than EE126: 6 assignments of 5-6 small questions, and 1 project). Now, finally, the specific subject matter of Stat 153 (time series analysis) is supplemental to statistical courses, and you do not need anything\u00a0specific to prepare for it - only for the application of this subject matter using statistical principles.</p>", "created": "2018-06-11T20:25:45Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p9d0f5p6m3"}], "id": "jiapj5asukk4qk", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7pg67kb6cn", "name": "Brian Truong", "photo": "1472887383_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p7pg67kb6cn/1472887383_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idt70iw29cx3", "name": "Lucie Choi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["is6p7pg67kb6cn", "idt70iw29cx3", "is6p6uis14y5ot"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 6/10 - 6/16", "bucket_order": 97, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 6/10 - 6/16", "bucket_order": 97, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-12T22:20:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jic931uneg753b", "subject": "<p>I think if you have taken EECS126 and want to get into ML, then taking EE127 followed by EECS189 is the standard recommended path.

Right off the bat, I think that is the appropriate sequence to take them in if you have the background assumed in this thread. The two are not alternatives to each other, and have a lot of content aside from the overlapping material (for the large part, the overlap is restricted to the spectral analysis of signals and time indexed data). I highly recommend taking them both, and in this sequence. In that case, first taking EE120 gives you the EE perspective on signal processing. Note, EE120 has a lot more than just frequency analysis of signals (Eg: Llinear system theory, for starters). Now, Stat 153 also has a lot more than the spectral analysis of signals (Eg: ARIMA modeling, GARCH models, forecasting and a lot more). Further, even the part which overlaps is handled differently in both the courses: 120 looks at it from a signals point of view, and Stat 153 gives some very nice insights from a statisticians point of view (for instance: how the Fourier transform is an ANOVA splitting the variance into frequency components).\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is6p9d0f5p6m3", "updated": "2018-06-17T01:55:17Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-12T22:04:34Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jic8i2p17jf2ni", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Hey\u00a0Nikunj, would you suggestion 153\u00a0over 151A?
