It will indeed be an excellent offering allowing students to learn HCI and gain insight from leading industrial HCI researchers. However, (and you will see this reflected in past offerings of CS160 when taught by non-UC Berkeley faculty such as researchers from Microsoft, etc) we cap course enrollment at lower levels.

For this semester we will cap class enrollment at 120. There will be a smaller waitlist to meet expectations. The course will not be webcast and we will not be expanding the course beyond 120. I encourage many of you to take CS160 in the summer or again there will be a Spring 2020 offering. Thanks for your interest in HCI!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Eric Paulos<br />Associate Professor<br />EECS, UC Berkeley</p>", "created": "2019-04-30T19:30:56Z", "subject": "CS160 Fall 2019\u2022\u00a0UPDATED BY PROFESSOR PAULOS", "uid": "havqkooc34e66g"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jv46stal9gz27n", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 3, "nr": 9445, "num_favorites": 3, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546623243, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhez4o9j601", "name": "Jun Hee Han", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1570093295, "jq33x9vemkj5xj": 1550003048, "jxzgoek4x4j4u6": 1570093295}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjm5sqotm026wq", "name": "shoumik", "photo": "1570879757_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjm5sqotm026wq/1570879757_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6d4v1umgas6rl", "name": "Kevin Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jy0hrp0yp3f2re": 1575573064}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j7kzt5peow04ff", "name": "Gabriel Nahum", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7lai7g669b", "name": "Ariel Hirschberg", "photo": "1579576991_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p7lai7g669b/1579576991_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1548797126, "jkjt85cc6fc4jx": 1541740603, "jko89qm4qo732a": 1543432634, "jqr7hfmf4v74e": 1552945044, "jr6wgkg4hqh19q": 1548796612}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhrzrklubu41ah", "name": "Hamza Qadeer", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jqo5m28i9p02lm": 1549766390}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is0vluorxe1cw", "name": "Violet Sinnarkar", "photo": "1565309954_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is0vluorxe1cw/1565309954_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ici5rjmp9on1ym", "name": "Brian Levis", "photo": "1507840593_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ici5rjmp9on1ym/1507840593_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy24rg2lvit4dr", "name": "Tina Zhao", "photo": "1529347134_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iy24rg2lvit4dr/1529347134_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8qrtz4z4r", "name": "Kendal Asprec", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9iqhcexqe", "name": "Janaki Vivrekar", "photo": "1563065131_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9iqhcexqe/1563065131_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhez4o9j601", "jjm5sqotm026wq", "j6d4v1umgas6rl", "j7kzt5peow04ff", "is6p7lai7g669b", "jhrzrklubu41ah", "is0vluorxe1cw", "ici5rjmp9on1ym", "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "iy24rg2lvit4dr", "is6p8qrtz4z4r", "is6p9iqhcexqe"], "tags": ["announcements", "eecs", "enrollments", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 1951}
