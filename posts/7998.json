As far as getting a role with a title like &#34;Data Scientist&#34;, &#34;Machine Learning Engineer&#34;, &#34;Research Engineer&#34;, or &#34;Computer Vision Engineer&#34;, I think it may be a little bit difficult if your only experience is undergrad coursework. In my experience, interviews for these types of roles usually involve explaining prior ML projects, answering ML/CV design questions, or being quizzed on basic concepts in ML/CV. I think undergrad coursework helps with answering basic questions in ML, but it might be hard to answer the other questions without having some project experience, which could come in the form of grad course projects, personal projects, or research projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But like I mentioned, I think there are many roles out there with the title &#34;Software Engineer&#34; in which you&#39;ll be able to work on ML things if it&#39;s something you actively seek while you are a part of the company.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just to try and add some additional perspective, applied ML in industry is very different from ML in academia/classes.\u00a0In classes and academic research, the focus is often on developing and studying the learning algorithm itself. However, in industry, the focus is often instead on the data. So if you&#39;re doing applied ML work in industry, chances are you&#39;ll grab an off-the-shelf algorithm from sklearn and then spend a lot of time cleaning and formatting data.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "ijbyyqoowfj720", "updated": "2018-10-21T23:33:48Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-10-21T22:39:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other", "faculty_advising", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a senior, double-majoring in CS and Pure Math.\u00a0Last summer, I interned at a startup company and received a full-time offer in the end. However, I&#39;ve been taking some of the ML-related courses here at Cal (EE 126, 127, Data 100) and I&#39;ve really enjoyed them; I also plan to take CS 189 and 182 next semester. I know that since I haven&#39;t taken CS 189 yet it&#39;s a bit early to think about whether I&#39;ll end up being interested in doing/learning machine learning, but I&#39;ve really enjoyed the application of some of the ML-related concepts\u00a0that I saw in CS 188, EE 127 and Data 100, and I believe that I have the appropriate math background to do reasonably well in CS 189 and I also believe that I will enjoy the course as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My question is: is there a decent chance that I can get a good job post-graduation that will involve ML/DS-related work? (maybe in Computer Vision?). I am not looking for a top-company job, just a job that will involve applying concepts that we learn in ML-related courses here at Cal. I won&#39;t be going to grad school in the near future, but I may take an extra semester next fall to take some relevant grad courses. Or should I just accept the offer, graduate next semester and go work as a Software Engineer?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, would adding a third Data Science major help in this case?
