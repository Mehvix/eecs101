The statement of purpose seems straightforward, but the personal history statement seems to be a subset of the first question in the SOP. Is the Personal history supposed to be generally &#34;Why do you want to go to grad school at berkeley?&#34; (from a non-technical perspective, i.e. culture, fit), or what? The statements after the PHS (asking about barriers to education and underrepresentation) seem to be indicating that they want to read some sort of unorthodox story of how someone came to apply to EECS masters. Is this True? Can anyone who has applied/has done the application share how they approached the separating these 2 questions?</p>", "created": "2019-01-01T23:34:11Z", "subject": "Statement of Purpose vs Personal History 5th year masters", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jqee390fgy67of", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8504, "num_favorites": 8, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547697100, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7ieubzd674", "name": "Farhan Toddywala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "name": "Atharva Mehendale", "photo": "1581703162_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhcjpozd5xg/1581703162_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p7gejsqw65o", "name": "Gokul Swamy", "photo": "1553076556_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p7gejsqw65o/1553076556_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jc88cyyi295668", "name": "Bryant Le", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1525153666, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1527030308, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1525109355, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1539234857}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9v8jj8x141", "name": "Mohammed Shaikh", "photo": "1515230849_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9v8jj8x141/1515230849_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jhw82c92o5p1dh": 1532404312}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq", "name": "Nimalen Sivapalan", "photo": "1456610056_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hzd1lb5fiuc2sq/1456610056_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p7ieubzd674", "jktvhcjpozd5xg", "is6p7gejsqw65o", "jc88cyyi295668", "is6p9v8jj8x141", "hzd1lb5fiuc2sq"], "tags": ["eecs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 546}
