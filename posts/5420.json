Well, I know most of your answers are going to be something like, &#34;take what interests you&#34;, but I think we can all agree that there are few select courses that every sensible CS/ EE student should take. For example, last I checked, the EECS department says that a student can graduate having taken only 4 upper-div EECS courses. Isn&#39;t this misleading in that the student might end up to be inadequately prepared? \n\nAlso, does it matter which upper-divs I choose to take? I mean, there are so many upper-divs to choose from that it is almost impossible to tailor courses according to one&#39;s needs. Can someone share thoughts on classes they think every CS/EE major should have under their belt?
