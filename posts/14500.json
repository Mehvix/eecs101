If this is your first position, be willing to work startups or lower-paying positions, including internships. With limited experience, you&#39;re unlikely to land something extremely competitive right off the bat as others are ahead of you, so the goal is to build your resume up. Even the tiniest startup will get you new experiences to speak to, and at the very least, will be able to add something to your resume. Look to applying to non-tech organizations that need developers anyways and look past the big names. Volunteer your expertise at organizations if you are financially able to do so. Create a personal project outside of classes so you have something to talk about. With a well-known CS school like Berkeley, recruiters and interviewers are often familiar with what&#39;s covered in class. To stand out you want to be able to speak to experiences that not everyone has.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember that it&#39;s only just March and you still have a solid two months before graduating! That&#39;s enough time to find a job or internship post-grad. Things may also start to look up as a whole as we get into summer, when there will be fewer pandemic-related restrictions and businesses will be more willing to take on new hires. There is also no shame in not immediately having a job post-grad, even though in a major like CS where people are constantly talking about their hiring it may feel so. If you are in a financial position to do so, take some time off to dedicate just to job search and to recuperating from a very tough year. If finances are more pressing, it is okay to take a job that is not directly related to SWE or development for the time being for both general work experience and money. Job searching is tough in any year, especially in a pandemic, and it&#39;s ok if your career path isn&#39;t linear.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j84vts9t9a719k", "name": "Vivek Datta", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j84vts9t9a719k"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-03-01T18:17:18Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 2/28 - 3/6", "bucket_order": 12, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-03-01T22:44:58Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "klr66xhxa0u35n", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Same boat, seriously sucks.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2021-03-01T22:44:58Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "seen": {"10226": 5, "10948": 1, "11476": 8, "12204": 0, "13284": 4, "13675": 6, "9120": 9, "9139": 7, "9959": 3, "9971": 2}}, "created": "2021-02-28T05:16:11Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a graduating senior with no internships and no job offers.
