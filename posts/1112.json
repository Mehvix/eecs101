The workload was extremely light. There were 5 problem sets with around 5 questions each, around the same type as 170.\n\nThere are biological motivations behind the algorithms, but the main thing for the class is learning algorithms. The 3 main areas we covered were string search algorithms (which are useful for things outside biology), phylogentic tree algorithms (which don&#39;t really have much of a use outside biology, or at least I haven&#39;t heard much about it), and hidden markov models (which definitely do have uses outside biology). Background information was given on why we would learn such algorithms and apply them to biology, but they weren&#39;t tested on.\n\nExams are fairly more difficult to prepare for as there aren&#39;t as many practice problems and past tests to go over. You maybe get 6-8 practice problems for each of the midterms and the final, where the exam would be 5 questions. The questions are around 80% prove this statement/design an algorithm to do this, and 20% mechanical problems such as apply this algorithm from the class on this input.", "created": "2016-04-08T02:22:42Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "imr37yvgc4nk", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ids66zeithd2ov": 1, "ijltj19y6lv59e": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hlx51hr3snv1zn", "name": "Yiqun Chen", "photo": "1454110371_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hlx51hr3snv1zn/1454110371_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hzcyguxdsub1cx", "name": "Jennifer Dai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1557211355, "j6ipkhtdol54dw": 1, "jcfrsqcwoyyi5": 1523820522, "jiow4wnlt5e4v9": 1536690148, "jpdq1epqrr3231": 1557544831, "k5oggml4hjtu9": 1581048462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6srsl4o5no", "name": "Benson Yuan", "photo": "1548892164_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6srsl4o5no/1548892164_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["hlx51hr3snv1zn", "hzcyguxdsub1cx", "is6p6srsl4o5no"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-04-08T01:56:35Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>For anyone who has taken 176 before, how much bio is there?
