The absolute most important thing is to have a good grasp of the material in 16A, both lab and content. This means being comfortable with the linear algebra you see in 16A, basic circuit components like resistors/capacitors/op-amps, and good lab practice (using equipment correctly and safely, and good debugging techniques). Apart from that, one thing I see many of our students struggle with is dealing with complex numbers for the first time (this is taught in Math 1B, but many test out of it through AP Calculus, which doesn&#39;t cover complex numbers in enough depth). Familiarizing yourself with the various mathematical identities relating to complex exponentials, and the intuition behind use of the complex plane, will serve you well through 16B.

However, as I learned more, I started to gain interest in the class and realized how important the class was for the future. I would like to do well in EE16B in order to make up for my deficient learning in EE16A. Should I look at the things I learned in EE16A? or should I study for EE16B ahead of time? The answer is probably &#34;do both&#34; but I would like to hear from people who were in a similar situation and took both classes. Any advice would be appreciated.
