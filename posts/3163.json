The point of an undergrad joining a research lab is to learn, so it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t already &#34;know it all&#34; - professors know this and I think that trying to paint yourself as someone who does already know it all (especially if you don&#39;t and it&#39;s obvious from your resum\u00e9) is overall detrimental to your application.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, professors take undergrads (especially the younger ones without many upper div classes) as a sort of &#34;investment&#34; - maybe you don&#39;t already know everything there is to know about AI/ML, but hopefully by working in their lab for one or two years, you can get up to speed about the topics and maybe even contribute something to the field, be it something big like a paper in IEEE or something small, like improving an algorithm&#39;s runtime (maybe not asymptotically, but at least decreasing a constant factor or something). In the lab, I work under a graduate student on his project, although that is because in the field I work in the PI does very little lab work, and rather spends most of his time writing grants and papers.
