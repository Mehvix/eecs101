Recently I dropped the R1B and wanted to take another six-week course which has a time conflict with the 61C discussion and lab I enrolled in. I do know that\u00a0CS courses during summer disallow concurrent enrollment, but the case is that the lecture time is not in conflict, and I can choose to go to different discussion and lab (actually I&#39;m attending a different discussion right now, and I&#39;m sure there are empty seats in the ones I will attend) so that everything works fine (also consider\u00a0the flexible policy of letting students attend different lab/discussion in many CS courses). Now the Calcentral is preventing me from enrolling into a second course due to this conflict issue, and I wonder who should I contact with in order to resolve this issue?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A lot of thanks!</p>", "created": "2019-07-07T22:15:39Z", "subject": "Time conflict between 61C and another six-week course", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jxtimk2id8o49t", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 1, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9826, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654546227688, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["enrollments", "student", "unanswered"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 229}
