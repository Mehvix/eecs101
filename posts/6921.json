However, I just rechecked my schedule as I knew that some of the discussions were still TBA (one class&#39; still is), and unfortunately found out that now the lecture times for the two IEOR classes conflict once a week. Given that IEOR 172 is essentially a math/stat class, I&#39;m thinking I could learn the material just fine not attending lecture and simply using lecture notes or whatever is possible. Could anyone confirm whether attendance is required for 172 lectures, and/or if the fact that those two lectures conflict will be an issue in any other way?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "created": "2018-05-03T23:03:15Z", "subject": "Conflict in classes already enrolled in", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jgr4zh5fic02n2", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 6921, "num_favorites": 1, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654549397818, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iw9jrm9iwm56c1", "name": "Michael Lavva", "photo": "1579166933_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/iw9jrm9iwm56c1/1579166933_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["iw9jrm9iwm56c1"], "tags": ["enrollments", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 261}
