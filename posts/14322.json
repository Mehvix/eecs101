It\u2019s never too early to be that teacher and mentor to a younger student, especially during these times. This is why five of Berkeley's premier mentorship organizations have joined together for our **very first Education Clubs Info Session on Friday, January 29th from 7-8 pm!** At this event, we will each talk about our clubs\u2019 missions, structures, and events, and afterwards, there will be time to talk directly to each club you are interested in joining! \n\nFacebook event: https://fb.me/e/66xWU6Lj1\nZoom link: https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/95213584984 \n\nHere\u2019s a short description of each organization to pique your interest\n\n**ANova:** Berkeley ANova is a student organization dedicated to making access to computer science education and opportunities more equitable, available, and achievable for students of all backgrounds. Our outreach and mentorship efforts introduce computer science to students from under-resourced schools and marginalized communities. \n\n**BEAM:** We are BEAM, Berkeley Engineers and Mentors, a student run organization that develops and teaches hands-on science and engineering activities to K-8 grade levels at local schools. Our goal is to make science and engineering more approachable and engaging and to encourage students of ALL backgrounds to pursue classes and careers in STEM-related fields.\n\n**PiE:** Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) is a non-profit organization on campus that hosts a robotics competition each year for over 20 underserved Bay Area high schools! We are currently looking for mentors to help our student teams throughout the competition as well as staff members to work on making the competition happen! We have a lot of different projects for software, hardware, education, and more. We don\u2019t have an application and accept students of all background, majors, and experience levels!\n\n**Project S.M.I.L.E:** Project S.M.I.L.E. is an undergrad student-run service organization that provides holistic mentoring (enrichment, social, and academic) to the middle school students at Willard and Longfellow middle schools. Through personal match-ups, our mission is to provide mentees and mentors with an opportunity to develop special relationships of respect, trust and support. As a mentor, you can also join our bi-weekly seminar and earn a unit of Education field-work!\n\n**TMC:** The Music Connection provides free music tutoring for young students in the Berkeley area. We aim to bridge the socioeconomic gap in music education by making it more accessible rather than a privilege. Join us to tutor students privately, work with students in their music classes at school, or lead weekly music-themed workshops! \n\nIf you can\u2019t make this event, no worries! Each of our organizations are hosting individual info sessions. The dates and links to those events are posted below:\n\nANova: [Berkeley ANova Recruitment Info](http://berkeleyanova.org/join) / [Facebook Event](https://fb.me/e/cICEOT47P)\nBEAM: [Monday, February 1st 7:00 - 8:00 pm P.S.T](https://fb.me/e/6aW2TIxbX)\nThe Music Connection: [Tuesday 1/26 6-7pm](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/93903847566), [Monday 2/1 6-7pm](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/93054300041) \nPioneers in Engineering: [Tuesday 1/26 4:00 - 5:00 pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/749911722579904/) / [Thursday 1/28 7:00 - 8:00 pm](https://fb.me/e/1wMiQZTL6)\nProject SMILE: [Wednesday, 1/27 8:00 - 9:00 pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/1140196033069229), [Thursday, 1/28 6:00 - 7:00 pm](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fberkeley.zoom.us%2Fj%2F96086610615%3Fpwd%3DZmNqUVBiTmRLM0ZQL2RXVWZqUDd0UT09%26fbclid%3DIwAR1t_n_ENh0uY-XDKtGTX5hWzrF72iusPjYEjoaBzhwk6ZD2tam-orAQZys&h=AT0s_btl7w2d9BZ01uIr8qRonkrRaf4scBs-9jqvQiaJxQRoImu0ThEMOMu_y91auwgL_--ciFPeWSAhXtQ418AsTXi3FFld3zigZzFJPGM_POSoR7eU5XsNZWNNegYgqI42Uv3W0rNUgB5LgIuQOUYy8Q&__tn__=-UK*F)\n\n<img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fj3hwokaffi34ce%2Fa53f46d3003347f34da1ac84e26577bcd13e153f03d92e8751967e0b0e9d7072%2Fed_clubs_infosesh.png\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" alt=\"\" />\n</md>\n\n</p>", "created": "2021-01-24T19:29:32Z", "subject": "Education Clubs Infosession", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "kkbjcxobsyc2zd", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 14322, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654541242425, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhffczf460f", "name": "Eshani Mehta", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3hwokaffi34ce", "name": "Joy Dong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu5rf91pu54y", "name": "Anna Gao", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1581210147, "jziyku5gomy7aq": 1576285183, "k0g9j3r04edcn": 1575391697, "k5eevxebzpj25b": 1579570570, "k5g56y7yegw5xr": 1581284108, "k5mvapjoenll2": 1586565748, "k5qacftvzwp155": 1585607475, "kdz4wzqnb6052o": 1603637279, "ke609ylh5ap5uv": 1603222682}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jy1rz92rpon1wh", "name": "Akshit Dewan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzdh1pp0lb738s", "name": "Jay Feng", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvhffczf460f", "j3hwokaffi34ce", "j6nu5rf91pu54y", "jy1rz92rpon1wh", "jzdh1pp0lb738s"], "tags": ["enrichment_opportunities", "events", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 330}
