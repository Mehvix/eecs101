However, if you&#39;re looking for an experience that&#39;s long established, you could take 61BL instead. I suppose if you really want the Hug experience, go for 16A over summer. Both classes are relatively similar in terms of coursework in my opinion, depending of course on your mathematical and CS background. If you feel like you&#39;re particularly better suited to learn math faster, take 16A. If you&#39;ll likely learn CS faster, take 61BL.</p>", "created": "2020-04-20T08:01:39Z", "subject": "", "uid": "jzkuy4i1v765ox"}], "id": "k986xmzcfxj44k", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzkuyh8rm4o5xf", "name": "I-Chia Chen", "photo": "1579127473_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jzkuyh8rm4o5xf/1579127473_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jzkuyh8rm4o5xf"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"11692": 1, "3407": 4, "3559": 3, "3810": 5, "3935": 9, "4505": 2, "6505": 6, "6902": 7, "6923": 8, "8372": 0}}, "created": "2020-04-20T07:15:12Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m looking to take either EE16a or cs61bl over summer but am not sure which one to do.
