In terms of usefulness, having taken/been involved with most of them, I would say it depends on what you know already and what you want to learn along with how many units you can take next semester, none of which you mentioned, so it&#39;s hard for me to say. <br /><br />If you want to be a software engineer or have a good personal website profile, I would say intro to algorithmic thinking and the web design decal are good choices (you can&#39;t really go wrong with these two if you get in). <br /><br />If you want to focus on learning how to work with xcode then do the ios decal (actual ios dev roles will use uikit while the decal teaches the simpler swift ui so if you have already taken 61a/61b then you may be ready for more). There are 2 cloud decals, but assuming you mean <a href=\"https://calcloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://calcloud.org/,</a> that has some cool speakers from the web design decal and Microsoft recruiters but if you can do personal side projects then I&#39;d go with web dev/leetcode.</p>", "created": "2020-12-10T22:44:13Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kijfhya9c355ey", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jygyydummf54kx", "name": "Abel Feleke", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1605430641_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1605430641_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jygyydummf54kx", "kaddqruc8a45kz"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2020-12-10T20:00:03Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "When can we start signing up for them?
