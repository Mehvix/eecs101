OpenMP is one of the projects (albeit much more involved). Locking and thread management concepts are also discussed. I found that 61C and 162 were indirectly helpful in that a lot of the concepts behind system design were repeated in different contexts (I.e. shared vs distributed memory). Caching is a big theme in the class, and there was a good amount of data structures related content. In general, it featured a potpourri of a lot of systems concepts, so I feel like OS, machine structures, and data structures would definitely be helpful.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hope this helps! :)</div>", "created": "2020-05-21T07:05:05Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is2w60k310itc"}], "id": "kagfkayyqkg6k9", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "bucket_order": 4, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-05-22T01:07:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kahi8i8y3u84ie", "subject": "Of course!
