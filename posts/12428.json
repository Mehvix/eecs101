Since I was stat I never took it, but anyway. Stat 134 is awesome if you can take it with Adhikari, but sadly she rarely teaches it anymore. I found 135 much less interesting but also had a horrible lecturer/course staff, the main thing that I took out of it was something called an MLE that is very useful in an future statistical inference classes (including a lot of ML). 133 is a waste of time that we&#39;ve been petitioning to skip and I believe there&#39;s some way to now if you&#39;re CS. 153 is pretty valuable from a data analysis point of view, 151a is great for building an in depth understanding of what regression is actually all about, 102 is a pretty fun class (way better than data 100 in my opinion and significantly more mathy), then I did the special topics 157/260 with Prof. Brown who&#39;s awesome. The big thing with the stat department is it&#39;s just not organized as well as CS. I have theories as to why, but it&#39;s usually 4-5 GSIs and maybe 1-2 will actually care about teaching. Expect to get homeworks back 1-2 months after turning in, exams 2-3 weeks. Professors/Lecturers are very hit and miss. Adhikari is amazing, I avoid Ibser at all costs. Jared Fisher is pretty good for 153, as is Sam Pimentel for 151a. Then it&#39;s cool when Mike Jordan teaches 102. Overall I hated 133 and 135 and loved 134, then I learned to ask around about professors and classes way more because stat classes are subject to a good bit more variation than CS in the quality of the class in my opinion.
