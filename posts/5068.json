A big tip that I would give is to really understand the material in and out. This is clich\u00e9, but the idea is that don&#39;t just do all your assignments and watch lectures, but actually go one step further; when working on assignments, think about other questions that could be asked related to that specific concept and how you would answer it. Also, don&#39;t be afraid to try different things out in the Python interpreter, as you learn a lot by\u00a0experimenting with\u00a0things on your own. Another tip is to start studying, if you can, about a week and a half before the midterms/exams so you are not cramming and stressing as much. This gives you enough time to review concepts, ask about them, and do many exams.</p>", "created": "2017-09-30T09:21:57Z", "subject": "", "uid": "is6p7mw5sn76a7"}], "id": "j873z4fuojr4se", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1540695887, "ij5ddqc0arp6r4": 1, "inpjqrbfv3n67o": 1, "j6b1o0sq8uz77d": 1, "j6fe5friemd22w": 1513061113, "jaepthp7wf44nh": 1520900334, "jc3u2srizc772k": 1520362543, "jjz9cg9j55e3m7": 1544484885}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijkkwecxsj63n8", "name": "Ajay Ramesh", "photo": "1540771025_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ijkkwecxsj63n8/1540771025_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipxjx49hzgs1di", "name": "Jennifer Zou", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p759ji5o5ws", "name": "Vera Wang", "photo": "1529996635_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p759ji5o5ws/1529996635_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "photo": "1544372913_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idriks20rqg42v/1544372913_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["iscem14kbsu5vi", "ijkkwecxsj63n8", "ipxjx49hzgs1di", "is6p759ji5o5ws", "idriks20rqg42v"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 9/24 - 9/30", "bucket_order": 141, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2017-09-30T16:31:16Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "j87jb8mokep1v6", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>The exams are much, MUCH harder than the homeworks/projects (at least when I took it Fall 2015).
