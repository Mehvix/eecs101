And one can create multiple completely reasonable 4-year-plans that skip any one upper-division course. \u00a0And yes, that includes 170 too now. The lower-division by contrast, is all essential for everyone. (There was a bug for a bit when LSCS wasn&#39;t required to take both 16AB but that has since been fixed.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, it was assumed that students should be talking to their faculty adviser about their course paths holistically, and that students would be picking faculty advisers who understand broadly the areas that they want to engage with. (This was about a factor of three fewer students ago, when faculty advising could also be mandated in the system.) The concept was that if students instead used the flexibility to pick wrong-headed course lists, they would know they are doing something silly but that it was their choice. And on balance, it was better to permit flexibility than to demand petitions.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, the flexibility also technically permits lots of course plans that are quite bad. The idea was that faculty advising would take one look and say &#34;that is really not a good idea&#34; and students would change. Just because there are lots of good paths doesn&#39;t mean that all paths are good! And not all paths are good for every student. A good program helps students constantly grow in a way that matches their strengths\u00a0while patching their weaknesses. A faculty adviser is supposed to\u00a0see student&#39;s grades and resume&#39; and be able to advise accordingly. Nobody ever thought that a student on their own or a peer would be able to do this selection on their own given just the course catalog.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The idea was also that the lower-division would give students a broad exposure (since students are supposed to complete the lower division before taking any upper division courses in the department). And students could always go to faculty office hours in the lower division to ask for generic course advice too.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the reasonably light requirements (except for transfers for whom the requirements are quite intense), there was also some room for error and experimentation.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That was the idea anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created":
