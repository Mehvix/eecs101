I\u2019m also currently signed up for Data 8, but I just got the email regarding stat 89a and it seems interesting (although there seems to be a lot of overlap with EE 16A). I want to take a 4 unit class that won\u2019t be too challenging since I\u2019m already taking 61B and 16B ... would I be better suited taking Data 8 or Stat 89A (I\u2019m also open to any suggestions for other interesting STEM classes that don\u2019t have too heavy of a workload).
