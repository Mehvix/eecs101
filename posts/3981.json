To this audience, they are designed to help advance their skill in thinking about information and how it connects to the real world, building a solid foundation in concrete linear algebra (of Euclidean n-space and complex c-space) along the way. The 16AB series are designed to be modern and to be the right lower-division introduction in a world that has ML as an important topic that many students will engage with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The circuits content in 16AB (static linear circuits in 16A and dynamic circuits in 16B along with transistors as switches with parasitics) is designed to do two things. First, be synergistic with the overall themes of thinking (modeling, design thinking, breaking problems into smaller parts, mapping things to mathematics, etc...) and linear algebra in the rest of the course. There is a purely pedagogical purpose here. Second, to expose students to circuits as an alternative perspective on understanding information processing, with a particular focus on the interface to the real world. We believe that this alternative perspective and the mental muscles it develops is vital since a purely imperative or symbolic-functional perspective on information processing is too limiting for a 40-year career, especially as we consider\u00a0how information can be processed by things like neural networks both of the present and in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dynamical behavior perspective in 16B is also very important as we think about a future of robots, etc. and the introductory treatment of control theory is meant to convey some insight about how the combination of information processing and a physical system can result in a new combined physical systems that behaves differently. This kind of thinking, we believe, is going to be increasingly vital. It is not enough to think of a robot at the level of a physical system that obeys commands. Instead, we have to accept that the very nature of how the robot reacts to the world is intertwined with the information processing that we engineer.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The linear-algebraic material includes perspectives on casting problems as optimizations (including linear regression and minimum energy control) and detailed discussions of things like choices of coordinates, PCA (also a kind of optimization perspective) and the SVD, along with an exploration of how time-invariant structure in linear operators creates symmetries that can be exploited in the right coordinate systems. Most of the heavier lifting is done in 16B with the preliminaries introduced in 16A. The treatment of differential equations in 16B is consequently also very linear-algebra centered, and follows the paradigm of showing how the simple 1d case generalizes to higher dimensions with eigenstructure playing the starring role. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The default choice is that a student takes 16A and then 16B and then 70. That&#39;s how we intend students to take these courses. The introduction of 16AB in the freshman year allows upper division courses to adapt and improve because they can now count on these perspectives as well as the understanding that they provide. 189, for example, starting next semester will just take 16B for granted.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What do you need for 16B from 16A?
