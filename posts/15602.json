This is a 2-unit course that teaches fundaments of capital markets, including topics from market microstructure to asset pricing. Students get to build predictive models and try out portfolio optimization techniques with python data science tools. The DeCal covers a broad set of topics and aims to reduce the barrier of entry into the field. Guest lectures will also be given from traders at Citadel, Optiver, and Headlands to provide perspectives into the industry. Finally, students will also get to develop and test their own trading strategies for a final project.
