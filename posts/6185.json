It is true that 16A/B will also do this. Math 110 also helped me think in more abstract terms, which was required in homeworks.

The most recommended way to get that exposure is to take EECS127, since optimization is also incredibly useful. If you haven&#39;t had 16B, then EECS 127 is borderline essential to get the most out of 189, or any solid machine learning course actually (this has nothing to do with who is teaching and everything to do with the nature of the material itself if you want to earn a proper A-level understanding).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All that said, taking 110 after EECS127 can still be a good idea, since the full abstract perspective and axiomatic grounding in linear algebra is helpful generally.
