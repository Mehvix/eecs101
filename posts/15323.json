I also really enjoyed 170, but I think it&#39;s helpfulness towards interviews is exaggerated, only the material in the first 1-2 months is relevant and all of it can be self-studied. I do still highly recommend taking 170 though. In terms of work load, I thought 186 has a lot more consistent work, and there is a stretch where there are 3-4 projects released back to back. 170 in general is pretty light, although the concepts are definitely trickier than 186&#39;s. Can&#39;t comment on 16B because I will also be taking it in the fall :P</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I had to choose between your options, I would probably choose between 1 or 2, 3 might be a bit rough because it is still 2 upper div CS classes &#43; a high workload lower div.

As such, I was wondering if anybody could speak to whether the following workload would be realistic: EE16B &#43; CS186 &#43; CS170 &#43; technical Econ class in conjunction with another. If this is unrealistic, which of the following alternatives would you recommend:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. EE16B &#43; CS186 &#43; 2 Econ upper div&#39;s</p>\n<p>2. EE16B &#43; CS170 &#43; 2 Econ upper div&#39;s</p>\n<p>3.

I also kept CS186 in both alternatives since I&#39;d strongly prefer to have a coding class in the mix, but I hear CS170 could be useful for interviews, so I&#39;m considering both options.
