As someone who&#39;s a rising sophomore and is starting to look at internships and research opportunities that I might be eligible for, I&#39;ve been facing a dilemma that I was hoping someone who&#39;s been in my place could help me with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The thing is, whenever I&#39;m applying for an internship or research, a lot of times I see the recruiters/researchers (understandably) requiring students to be at least familiar, if not proficient, with\u00a0skills and tools that are either not in Berkeley&#39;s curriculum and are supposed to be self-learned (like knowing Javascript, React, etc.) or those that I will only learn much later on (like upper division courses on machine learning or industry tools like TensorFlow, etc).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the first case, I plan on using some of the many resources available online to learn the various languages/frameworks I need to know of. However, I&#39;m a bit confused on how to go about it: should I give each individual step enough time to completely solidify my understanding (eg. taking an entire course on HTML &#43; CSS, then another course solely on Javascript, and so on) or just enough that I am mostly familiar with everything (one course on all of front end development). The former ensures that my foundation is solid and the benefits that brings, while the latter allows me to know just enough to start applying for internships and learn more through hands-on experience. For people who&#39;ve been through this process, what would you recommend?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the second case, I&#39;m confused about how to fill the gap in my knowledge. I could take an online course that familiarizes me with machine learning and teaches me the industrial tools being used in the industry (such as TenserFlow/PyTorch, etc). However, after browsing through this forum, I&#39;ve seen a lot of professors and accomplished students mention that to truly grasp a topic like machine learning, you need to solidify your understanding of probability and optimization (by taking courses such as 126 and 127) before taking 189 to really understand the field. However, if I wait for the time required to do all of this and only then apply for research/internship positions that require ML knowledge, I feel it will be quite late and I won&#39;t be able to accrue sufficient experience before I graduate.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Considering the issues above, I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me out in solving this problem. And for students who&#39;ve been through something similar to my situation, I would be really grateful if you could explain how you navigated through it and any lessons you learned that you&#39;d like to share.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2019-08-25T04:18:54Z", "subject": "Dilemma while applying for internships/research", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "jzqgqkzn39m4tt", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10104, "num_favorites": 9, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545983925, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "juwz5t7uyqh4sa", "name": "Prakash Srivastava", "photo": "1594332334_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/juwz5t7uyqh4sa/1594332334_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is0qs2ektcs288", "name": "Ruby Aujla", "photo": "1598127935_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is0qs2ektcs288/1598127935_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhwn369f6ik", "name": "Kevin Zhu", "photo": "1578594899_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvhwn369f6ik/1578594899_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "name": "Ritvik Iyer", "photo": "1568015728_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjs6gec3ivg12c/1568015728_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9z4olgt182", "name": "Kartik Kapur", "photo": "1525305905_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9z4olgt182/1525305905_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgthztc95d5", "name": "Joycelin Liaw", "photo": "1535914662_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jktvgthztc95d5/1535914662_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6h91kq4a1l5", "name": "Sean O'Brien", "photo": "1572369776_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jjs6h91kq4a1l5/1572369776_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvgw2lrsc5g2", "name": "Aditya Ramkumar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhln7qf4679", "name": "James Jung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvfivqsei4f2", "name": "Nicholas Berberi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvhopc26l6a8", "name": "Laiming Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktviadu64j6ww", "name": "Lucas Huang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bzrwgmhs60y", "name": "Mialy Rasetarinera", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jktvex6279x3zb", "juwz5t7uyqh4sa", "is0qs2ektcs288", "jktvhwn369f6ik", "jjs6gec3ivg12c", "is6p9z4olgt182", "jktvgthztc95d5", "jjs6h91kq4a1l5", "jktvgw2lrsc5g2", "is6p9mf96y2ty", "jktvhln7qf4679", "jktvfivqsei4f2", "jktvhopc26l6a8", "jktviadu64j6ww", "ke2bzrwgmhs60y"], "tags": ["faculty_advising", "other", "peer_directed", "research", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 567}
