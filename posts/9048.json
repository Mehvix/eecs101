I think that you&#39;ll definitely benefit from taking 70 when you take 170 because a lot of the logical thinking required for the former class carries over to the latter, but it is true that having taken probability directly before 126 would probably be more advantageous overall. And yeah, 126 workload is definitely higher than 170&#39;s imo.</p>", "created": "2019-04-09T03:44:02Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "I&#39;d personally say 170 is less difficult/time consuming, but 126 would benefit more from taking 70 the semester before.\u00a0", "created": "2019-04-09T01:03:55Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}], "id": "ju930a95p8m440", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [], "tag_endorse_arr": [], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-09T00:54:28Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "which class has a lighter workload and which class would benefit more from taking cs70 the semester before?", "created": "2019-04-09T00:54:28Z", "subject": "cs170 vs eecs126", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "ju92o4kynroi1", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 9048, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654547040373, "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "tags": ["other", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 315}
