For instance, initially hw&#39;s took &gt;20hrs, prelabs &gt;10 hrs to complete, but he reduced that considerably halfway through after student feedback: he combined prelabs with the hw, for a reasonable 10ish hrs total of work a week (I worked with a friend on hw/lab). Also, the prelabs are done with Cadence Virtuoso, which takes some time to get used to, though it will become a lifesaver later on.  Labs themselves can be finished during the lab period, with maybe 30 min extra needed occasionally.\n\nIn general, Niknejad focused much more on circuits than device physics (~75-25 split).  (taking 130 concurrently will make the device physics trivial). The beginning of the class will be time-consuming since you will have to solve the circuits with kvl/kcl (use mathematica to do the algebra.  I wish I knew about this before) to build intuition.  Eventually you&#39;ll get an aha! moment and be able to tell what a circuit (that used to take you 5 hrs) is doing at a glance, in mere seconds.  Its kinda beautiful really, though it&#39;ll still take now ~7ish hrs a week since the problems get much harder (from 1 transistor to many, with frequency response, swing, biasing, etc).  \nIn sum: It&#39;ll probably start off with about 10-15 hrs of work, and then once things click,  it will take half the time. The midterm &amp; final were easy/reasonable once this happens (unfortunately for me, this happened after the midterm).  My advice would be to really pay attention &amp; ask many questions during the two weeks where he first introduces single &amp; multistage amplifiers so that that aha moment happens. If you don&#39;t put in the effort during these 2 weeks you will never gain the intuition and the class will be hell.
