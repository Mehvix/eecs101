So, I think that about 12ish hours per week on average is what you should expect to be putting in.\u00a0It really depends a lot on the projects, but this isn&#39;t a do-it-all-in-three-nights kind of project.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, one kind of project that I want for sure to have at least one team on (with HCI background) is to develop a human-playable networked game so that we can see how humans\u00a0can learn how to collaborate/coordinate with strangers playing alongside them. If a team was to make a simple framework to make such games, make a game within that framework that exhibited the kinds of phenomena that we&#39;ll see in the DARPA challenge, had people play that game using say Mechanical Turk or some other platform by which we could have multiple people play the game to collect some data, and then analyzed that data to say something about collaborative intelligence --- this would be a solid A project. If the framework was made in a way that also let us drop in some AIs to see how they play against people, this would be a solid A&#43;. \u00a0This work could then turn into a paper and further research down the line if the students want to.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another kind of project that is still fine for the course would be a replication plus plus type study --- where a group replicates a result like the recent Google paper on learning encryption and then augmented it to see if a similar neural\u00a0network can learn to modulate and error-correct alongside. So lots of flexibility here.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over the course of a semester, this kind of thing I think is very reasonable to do with a team of 3 students working together. We might allow some mixed grad-student/undergrad teams as well. This way, a willingness to work hard in implementation, learn things well on your own in a group (talking to me and your fellow students along the way) and learn even more while you do so is enough to allow an undergrad to participate.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2016-11-23T18:55:08Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-11-23T07:40:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ivume9qxicx4hp", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>How much work would this be, say, compared to your offering of 16B last semester?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This class sounds very interesting, but I don&#39;t want my life to RIP, so I need to schedule accordingly.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2016-11-23T07:40:08Z"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 11/20 - 11/26", "bucket_order": 176, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 11/20 - 11/26", "bucket_order": 176, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-11-23T18:56:40Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ivvakabkazf2hg", "subject": "<p>3 units, but those are EECS units :-)</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "updated": "2016-11-23T18:56:40Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-11-23T07:43:10Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ivumi5u63fzbj", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>How many units will this be?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2016-11-23T07:43:10Z"}, {"anon": "full", "bucket_name": "Week 11/20 - 11/26", "bucket_order": 176, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 11/20 - 11/26", "bucket_order": 176, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2016-11-23T19:49:57Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ivvcgtp7eat2ev", "subject": "<p>This should be fine, especially if you are willing to work in a team with others whose skills complement your own.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the course is oversubscribed, I will select students so\u00a0that I have the best mix of diverse backgrounds to help the course as a whole succeed.
