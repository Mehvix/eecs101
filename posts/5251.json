Anyone who enrolled after the 80th student enrolled should have gone to the back of the waitlist and should not have been able to enroll, so querying such a list should be straightforward for anyone with the appropriate access to the database, e.g., pull a list of students who enrolled into cs194-129 with enrollment timestamp after the timestamp for the 80th student. Provide the list to EECS, and EECS can move those students to the back of the waitlist.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Data Fix vs. Bug Fix:</strong></p>\n<p>I think we should push for them to fix the data rather than the bug at this point because the data fix is more time urgent than fixing the bug. Fixing the bug in CalCentral enrollment system would not have any benefit for anyone until the next Phase I sometime in the summer when people are enrolling for Fall 2018 classes. But Phase II is about to start and it&#39;s in everyone&#39;s best interest for the data fix to be done as soon as possible. Obviously the bug fix on the actual swap feature should also be addressed but as mentioned above, the urgency of that is now pretty low and that could be handled any time in the next few months without any additional negative impact to students. Probably should have a separate tickets for the bug fix and\u00a0for the data fix/request.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Update &amp; Background on my ticket:</strong></p>\n<p>I asked sishelp if they could either fix the data or provide a list of the affected students to the EECS department so that the EECS dept could un-enroll the people who enrolled illegitimately via the swap function. I talked to Michael in the EECS department via email and he said the EECS department cannot lookup the list of the students to un-enroll because they only have the ability to look up the enrollment timestamp for people one at a time, which would obviously take way too much time for someone to do and they are swamped with enrollment stuff right now so it&#39;s not feasible. But I think a good compromise is for the technical team (sishelp) that has access to the database to write a quick query to pull such a list of students and provide it to the EECS department. Michael said he&#39;d be on board with that option. So I think we should try to figure out the best way to push for that solution. Would it come from us, the affected students, or would it be best for the EECS department to request the information?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I called sishelp today and they said my ticket was forwarded to the Office of the Registrar.

They didn&#39;t simply add them to the waitlist and got enrolled. They used SWAP. What does that mean? That means all of them were enrolled in another class, and got automatically dropped from that class after they are mistakenly enrolled in 194. At least some of them did not know that it was a bug. Many of you guys have used swap, so you know this. It is reasonable just to assume that you got in because you are EECS/CS and had priority and never bother this again. Now the question comes. If you guys manage to drop all those students and drug them back to the waitlist, what about that previous class that they have previously enrolled in? They cannot get in anymore. For example, a student was enrolled in CS 188, and swapped it with this CS 194, then he or she swapped in. That means the student is dropped from CS 188. If you guys want such students to be back on the waitlist, shouldn&#39;t you also give back his position in CS 188? Why should those students just end up having 4 less units (e.g. not able to add 188) during Phase 1 because of some system&#39;s bug? As you can tell, this is unfair. It is not those students&#39; fault.

I think the people here just feel as though they got cheated out of the class because of the bug and want to fix it in any way they can. The way the bug affects the students here is also very unfair and the fact that people could swap in and skip the waitlist is unfair.  For example, if a student decided early on that they wanted to take 194 instead of another class (let&#39;s say CS188) and ended up on the waitlist, they are also in the exact same situation as these swapping in students: Not being able to take 194 or 188. For some reason, these students are punished for planning ahead of time rather than swapping. I think it would be the &#34;most fair&#34; if those students were put back into their classes (or put at the very front of the waitlist) and the people on the waitlist for 194 got in. I think the other two alternatives (1. Letting the students stay in after the swap, which is unfair to the people on the waitlist and 2.
