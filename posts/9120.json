If you don\u2019t want to go to grad school, you don\u2019t have to study little details you\u2019re not not interested in, but your GPA might become lower, which doesn\u2019t matter as long as you graduate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>while you take classes, code 1 hour a day outside of class. Or do interview prep 1 problem a day at least. Fix your resume and possibly LinkedIn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>you have no control over how people will judge your gpa and school name. So I wouldn\u2019t worry about them. Don\u2019t list your gpa unless you feel proud of it on resume, and improve your skills everyday.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The truth is any of us can get a job anywhere we want as a software engineer if we have a resume that shows skills(projects count), and interview skills. This stressful idea in which gpa and brand name help is not healthy imo. Yes, recruiters are looking for the \u201cbest\u201d, and gpa and school rankings help them. But there\u2019s plenty of open slots.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>i have friends below 3.0 and got offers from all the prestigious companies. They had projects an interview prep.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>in conclusion, don\u2019t worry about how recruiters will judge you for school name and gpa. Just work hard everyday and results will come. Even if some companies have GPA cutoffs, find a way to get past it or just be wait few years after undergrad and they won\u2019t care anymore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In school, just work hard everyday and it will all work out.
