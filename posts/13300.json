I guess that&#39;s just how it goes. we are only through the first midterms so far so you totally have time to catch up. don&#39;t let your worries get you down. just focus on what motivates you and encourages you. the fact that you got a great internship and are still afloat in your classes at the same time says that you are focused and you can definitely power through.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnoszbx9j1vq", "name": "Raymond Ji", "photo": "1587969914_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/jzlnoszbx9j1vq/1587969914_200.jpg", "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnoszbx9j1vq"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-10-12T01:29:34Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-10-12T01:52:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Well now you have more time so definitely dedicate that to your classes.
