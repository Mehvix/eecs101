DIP is two-dimensional DSP. The theory is the exact same (the Nyquist theorem is the Nyquist theorem no matter how many dimensions your signal is), though DIP does have some tricks specifically for human vision. But as an undergrad, it&#39;s good to get a solid understanding of DSP and its cool range of applications before tackling what is essentially a 2D DSP research class. Especially since EE 123 is project-based (the final project in 123 is an image processing project too).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are some differences between how 225B and 123 are structured. 123 is much more similar to 194-26 since it&#39;s a guided undergraduate class that has fleshed-out class projects that form a neat portfolio for an undergrad. 225B is much more research-focused, with a big research project due at the end instead of structured course projects specifically designed to complement the course material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think for what most people take 194-26 for (a guided introduction to signal filtering and manipulation with cool and resume-worthy prepackaged course projects), 123 is a much more similar class. But if this isn&#39;t OP&#39;s specific use case, 225B is definitely also a good class in its own right.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2021-03-18T05:57:54Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>194-26 isn&#39;t really computer vision, it&#39;s computational photography (a flavor of image processing).
