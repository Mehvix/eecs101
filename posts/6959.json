OP here. So I emailed Hilfinger and he seemed pretty buzzed by my question and his literal answer was &#34;technically, this would be illegal&#34; and then when I asked about this being done in the past (aside: I am almost sure I read about this happening a year ago or so in Piazza) he said that he had no idea about that and that he had never dealt with a case like this. I was surprised by this because I have many friends who will intern this summer, also internationals, in other schools who do not face these fees. I guess it is something we will have to deal with until the EECS department comes up with an international-friendly solution for people doing internships during the summer (I do appreciate the fact that EECS makes a course for us to take and we only have to pay Summer tuition and and Campus fee summing up to $700, but a more optimal solution for international students in the future should address this problem and provide a 0-unit CPT course or something similar as in other schools)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2018-05-09T20:43:23Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-09T00:04:53Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "enrollments", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I remember reading like a year ago or so that the CS department, upon request, will waive charges for CPT during the summer and simply add the unit as an extra unit during the fall.
