The biggest question is simply, what do you want to do?<br /><br />To be clear, if you&#39;re interested in machine learning, a MS doesn&#39;t do much for you. I imagine you&#39;ll take courses like 189, or if you haven&#39;t already, 126/127 and something in the 170 series. Perhaps you&#39;ll take a grad class in CS, Math or Stats, but if you&#39;re only doing one or two of those courses, the tuition money is wasted -- at the end of the day, an ML engineer in industry has different goals, responsibilities, and thereby requisite skills, and thus getting a job will be the easiest way to become a bona-fide ML engineer. Moreover, the projected salary increase from an MS is speculative at best, given that extremely driven people would pay money to get a graduate degree and we&#39;re talking about averages -- plenty of BS degrees take non software/industry jobs, whereas MS students will. I can assure you that doing well, consistently enjoying your job and putting in your own effort and spice to the work environment will be much more rewarded than the ability to publish your first and last paper.<br /><br /><br />Regardless, if I haven&#39;t deterred you, <a href=\"https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/Theses/?_ga=2.175507426.1942633342.1531713275-1338851946.1516253226\" target=\"_blank\">here&#39;s a list of 5th Year MS thesis</a>\u00a0papers over the years.

Ideally I want to complete my MS at Berkeley. I am a rising third year EECS student, and I plan on graduating early in May 2019. I would like to spend my fourth year getting an MS at Berkeley. The main component I am missing is a solid faculty recommendation for research. Does anyone have any advice on how to get research with a Professor, and eventually get a recommendation for the continuing masters program within my last 2 semesters at Berkeley? I am primarily interested in doing research that involves ML, but I am open to anything really. Does anyone know of any Professors I should contact specifically?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a background, I have past research experience with URAP (I didn&#39;t really get as much out of this experience as I wanted which is why I didn&#39;t do research the last 2 semesters). I have a solid industry background with a few internships, mostly focusing on ML, NLP and a bit of controls. I have a high GPA with a mix of A&#39;s and A&#43;&#39;s in my EECS coursework.
