As for the work load, I think that it really will depend on your 169 group. I ended up putting a lot more\u00a0time into the project for that class than I really wanted to (although it worked out really well for me in the end), especially with the deadlines for both that and 170 hw on the same day. The main reason why I felt this wasn&#39;t a terribly hard schedule was because I was able to stay on top of the 188 projects and punch them out in an afternoon right when they were released.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Part of the difficulty will depend on your programming background, as 188 and 169 are kind of programming heavy compared to other courses. I took this schedule my fourth semester at Cal (so right after 61c/70), so I didn&#39;t have as much programming experience as someone who has taken other upperdivs, but that wasn&#39;t really a problem. 170 took a huge chunk of my time, as I found the homeworks to be difficult and long, although I am sure that if I had put more effort into the class, it would have been easier.</p>", "created": "2016-03-23T16:46:53Z", "subject": "", "uid": "hktxrgpzu3p39a"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>For you latter load, I&#39;d say that if you can get a good group, do CS162.
