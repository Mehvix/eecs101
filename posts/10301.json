You fear this is too much for others\u2014but that&#39;s not sufficient to support your point (otherwise the problem to solve would be resolving your fear itself).<br />Are the people you have in mind actually failing to succeed in some way in the long term, or merely struggling with\u00a0self confidence in the beginning?<br />To be honest, your post currently reads like success stories in the making\u2014you&#39;re worried about something going wrong in the long term, and yet your stories\u00a0suggest that it&#39;s actually turning out fine in the end!</li><li>Nothing in the post seems CS-specific to me. Is CS too difficult compared to other majors? Do you have evidence to back your response to the previous question?<br />While I have limited familiarity with other departments and majors, my experience hasn&#39;t really suggested to me that ours is the most difficult one at Berkeley. I feel there are other majors that have\u00a0more rough rides than CS, and yet,\u00a0I do feel I disproportionately\u00a0hear from CS. Of course there are a <em>lot</em> of things that could explain this, including the sheer class sizes, and including something I&#39;ll elaborate on below, but it&#39;s something that needs to be accounted for either way, whether we are to conclude that this\u00a0department&#39;s courses are overly difficult or if (conversely) we&#39;re suggesting that there is a genuine problem across the whole university.</li><li>The comparison to Stanford doesn&#39;t really help the argument. It&#39;s hardly established that being big on startups is the Right Thing to do (though this doesn&#39;t imply it&#39;s the <em>wrong</em> thing to do either). Their approach obviously has upsides, but we could easily argue why that approach has downsides too.

I mean terrible! 15 of us graduated that year, maybe less. Then I came to Berkeley and went through Admissions 2.0 to declare a major in CS. I studied CS because when I looked at the list of majors offered at Berkeley my first real thought was, &#34;Wow, the rest of these look boring AF!&#34; So I chose CS as my major and Math as my backup major incase things went South.</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What a stressful four years! And no one in my family believed me until a student on another campus killed himself.</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s my point: I am from a community of people that rarely get the things we hope for. So I planned for failure. Whatever the solution is, they won&#39;t find it before you declare OR before you graduate. And a lot of people won&#39;t acknowledge your struggle until you&#39;re long gone. It&#39;s time to move on.</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you get to Berkeley your past goes out the window and the wheels start moving quick on this new adventure. If I, a student with very little education in basic math and nothing in CS because of my bad High School, can find the grit and will to declare, graduate, and find a job in my field then anyone with passion or determination can too.</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, join CS for the money afterwards. That&#39;s fine. That just needs to be a strong enough thought and desire to motivate you to push past 2am and keep going. There will be many 2am&#39;s that you&#39;ll need to get through. All anyone is saying is that usually when 2am hits, you&#39;ve made 0 progress from where you were 24 hours ago, all your slip days are gone and the project is due tomorrow it&#39;s usually a passion and love for CS that gets you through it, not usually the thought that 3-5 years from now I&#39;ll have a well paying job.</p>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But I&#39;m not criticizing anyone for why they study CS. I&#39;m just telling you that whatever the reason, it has to be enough to motivate you because nothing will change in time for you to notice or care.</p>\n</div>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_8", "updated": "2022-01-31T16:09:56Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-09-26T04:36:54Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am currently a\u00a0senior student and was helping a friend with homework for a CS class. I however noticed he was distraught with the homework and he didn&#39;t think he would be able to finish in time. And if this was the first homework, how would he be able to do all the other homeworks, and the tests, questioning why did he try to become a CS major in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He really enjoyed math in high school and CS made good money so it was a perfect reason to major in CS. I did so for the exact same reason and I&#39;m sure many other students did so as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I told me it would be ok, I had been in the same place, many times in the class I had felt lost and hopeless, but I was able to push through the difficulties and pass. Many other students had been in the same place as well, but they had all pushed through it and passed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I had another friend that I encouraged to apply to Google. He didn&#39;t really want to because he thought he warn&#39;t good enough and he had no shot to get in. I had been in the same place before, I had applied to another big company and didn&#39;t think I would get in. But I still did it on the slim chance it could happen. I did get an interview which I was super nervous about and thought I\u00a0would fail, but still did it. Even after the interview I thought I had failed and would have to continue looking for another internship. But to my surprise, and I&#39;m still surprised, I passed and was offered an internship. I was so happy I told all my friends and they congratulated me telling me they knew I had it in me even when I didn&#39;t believe it. Just try and you never know.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My point is I&#39;ve noticed this is so common with Berkeley students. It&#39;s so difficult it crushes people&#39;s confidence. As a senior, I&#39;ve experienced that I can do it if I push through and believe in myself. But I fear the difficulty is too much for others. My friend who I recommend to apply to Google, I know he can do it, but he doesn&#39;t believe in himself. My friend who struggles in the CS class, I know he can pass the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Berkeley CS teaches tenacity and grit, incredible skills for life. But tenacity and grit mean nothing if you lose confidence to try new hard things, to do the things worth struggling for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>People joke about Stanford, how once you&#39;re in it&#39;s a breeze, you ride the grade inflation, and get internships practically handed to you. Of course this isn&#39;t the case, but I don&#39;t think the difficulty is as bad as Berkeley CS, or at least you have a better TA to student ratio to help students when they are struggling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why are Startups such a big thing at Stanford? Startups require huge confidence and irrational belief you can take on the world and win. Startups in practice are filled with difficult trenches where you need tenacity and grit to keep pushing through. Berkeley CS teaches this but it feels like Berkeley crushes you so hard you lose the freshman confidence you will change the world and go ing through the struggle of being right. Stanford puts you through the tests, but never crushes you that you lose that dream to change the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was able to surpass the struggles, I\u00a0went\u00a0to counseling because CS 162 was so difficult and I didn&#39;t know if I would be able to finish the projects. And this was after I had the confidence boost from interning at a dream company. Even know, I am taking easier classes but they are still difficult. At least now I have the confidence that I can work through and succeed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It makes me sad is there are so many bright Berkeley students that lose their passion, their dream, their confidence as they face the difficulties of Berkeley CS. Some decide CS isn&#39;t for them and never look at it again as their experiences were too painful. For you freshman doubting yourselves in CS 61A, YOU CAN DO IT. We have all been there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I feel Berkeley CS doesn&#39;t have to be so difficult. Yes, I&#39;ve learned a lot. I went from knowing no CS to becoming proficient in just 4 years which is crazy to me. But I could have learned it with it being easier and not as frustrating. Spending 4 hours on a problem and trying different methods of help but still not being to solve it\u00a0is demoralizing. This can be better and hopefully help Berkeley students hold that passion, and make a positive difference in the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/67mdln/berkeleys_cs61b_is_difficult_af/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/67mdln/berkeleys_cs61b_is_difficult_af/</a><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/67mdln/berkeleys_cs61b_is_difficult_af/\"></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/how-to-network-through-stanford-university.html\">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/how-to-network-through-stanford-university.html</a></p>", "created": "2019-09-26T04:36:54Z", "subject": "Berkeley&#39;s Difficulty is Detrimental to Berkeley", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "k107gzh4svy6zf", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 10301, "num_favorites": 30, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654545717023, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1542387698, "j6bczj0pmoo4mk": 1512278032, "jaepthp7wf44nh": 1525327897, "jkieu4nv1t55g8": 1538161283, "jr1f3sutei62un": 1550805110, "jz2c8op4xqq4z3": 1576298894}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ixwrh8mz7qt1nn", "name": "Brian Hung", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1619985606, "j9ladzzp4wmh": 1524243875, "jyq487ctcwuk8": 1571117164}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9a8vasskl", "name": "Alex Thomas", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1555916150, "jpslgn3m4lsk6": 1550591579, "jr9vegl92h23af": 1554699626, "jw6kndsic346lm": 1563171921, "jyz1vzhx2on2wq": 1570078500}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j3jk4zjmiay6xs", "name": "Wesley Deng", "photo": "1567572313_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j3jk4zjmiay6xs/1567572313_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jv62jqtohi06uz", "name": "Andrew White", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iy2fd7c99x41w5", "name": "Randy Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipf2ezhjrt956a", "name": "Urvi Guglani", "photo": "1520734378_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ipf2ezhjrt956a/1520734378_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrin4yxhispa", "name": "Lakshya Jain", "photo": "1474747210_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/idrin4yxhispa/1474747210_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvex6279x3zb", "name": "Maxwell Chen", "photo": "1579165146_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jktvex6279x3zb/1579165146_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jl5p1gz8iux6ah", "name": "Kayla Luna", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu3l1tkcr3k5", "name": "Owen Bai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jc88lkur5zo23j", "name": "Gregory Jerian", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6vdgnbhgcc2to", "name": "David Yi", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6wdztpg2l2v0", "name": "Ryan Deng", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8k3kizno", "name": "Brian Ho", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"inpjqrbfv3n67o": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ib1dv5jrbcc12j", "name": "Steven Lin", "photo": "1508577785_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/ib1dv5jrbcc12j/1508577785_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p815tz306kj", "name": "Averal Kandala", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is0vls53gakb4", "name": "Rafael A.
