Yeah this pretty much, except I was lazy and didn&#39;t do the original &#34;listening to the professors once&#34;.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The thing about labs and projects is, unlike midterms where you can study a ton and completely bomb it, I find putting in the time for labs/projects correlates linearly with how well you do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, most people bombed Project 1 because they disregarded the spec instructions to debug their C code. Ended up their code didn&#39;t compile -&gt; got a zero. A lot of students put in the extra few hours and basically got a free grade bucket out of it by at least making sure the code ran. Project 2-1 had similar testing requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many people took a lower score\u00a0for Project 3-2 because it was stacked during midterm 2. It was just unfortunate and I think no 61c student had a good week&#39;s rest that week. Personally, I prioritized Project 3-2 and took the hit on my midterm, scoring average (but getting REALLY lucky in scoring average, I truly believe I deserved a lower score on that exam). Projects 4 and 5 were relatively linear and if you spent the time working on it and started early, you were fine. But some students had burned out by then and slacked off.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Major tip with projects is just to work with people. Live at all the office hours, don&#39;t go for the TA, go for the students. I found that the majority of people that went to office hours were people who generally finished projects earlier. As such I could ask them for tips and watch for potential pitfalls ahead.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Make no mistake, this class is a grind. Looking back the material was fun and challenging, but it definitely did not feel that way mid-slog.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2016-12-28T06:29:09Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2016-12-28T00:28:42Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "ix87e8teb5w395", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>For the student&#39;s answer..
