Some people I know could rip through a 170 problem set in a few hours and others would take a day or longer. Similarly for CS162 and the projects although with a different time span. So the real question is where were you on that spectrum for cs61c and cs70 and how would you feel about taking cs61c and cs70 at the same time? Another thing to consider is that although you might be able to &#34;handle&#34; a specific load, that load might degrade your chance to fully ingest and understand the course material potentially leaving you with a lower grade at the end of the semester. That being said, CS162 and CS170 are amazing classes and I would argue that they are the most fundamental and important upper-divs to have. If you have not taken many other upperdivs, they will definitely help in many others.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-11-21T08:23:59Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}], "id": "ja9csvlu3ig377", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijkkw1kn3hv38l", "name": "Martin Guo", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["ijkkw1kn3hv38l"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-11-20T17:41:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello, due to a series of unfortunate events (Phase 2), I don&#39;t think I will be able to get into 161.
