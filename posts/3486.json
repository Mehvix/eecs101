So, I will give a &#34;Dad&#34; story to hopefully address your question. My kids embark on eye-rolling at this point, please feel free to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was in a seminar once where Terry Tao was speaking. He was a prodigy and now is an incredibly accomplished and also incredibly generous mathematician through his blog. He was describing at a fairly high level his work with Green regarding arithmetic progressions. He was writing fairly quickly on the board, but then stopped, for a while, thirty seconds perhaps even a minute. He concentrated, perhaps even rocked slightly. He then nodded, perhaps remarked something like &#34;OK&#34;, and continued his explanation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What was he doing?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Who knows?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But I will speculate. He was perhaps thinking about his explanation and how it fit in with the details of the proof of this epic theorem. To maintain integrity, the explanation had to be faithful to the actual proof, he could not go on without ensuring that. Moreover, he focused enough to get the details sorted in his mind and confirm that his explanation was indeed on solid ground. He did this in front of an audience that patiently awaited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This focus and integrity is perhaps a view of what math is, and what doing it takes. He wasn&#39;t comfortable with communicating much less having a soft understanding of what was going on, he had to ensure that what he understood and communicated was true. Certainly, many details were not there, but a plan whose parts could actually be executed was laid out. Second, he was able to focus and bring these things together in those moments, in front of an audience. The combination of the desire to communicate accurately and the ability to focus to gather what context he needed into his mind to verify his explanation was amazing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In CS70, one needs to do this on some level. For example, think about a proof of Fermat&#39;s theorem; or $$a^{p-1} = 1 \\pmod{p}$$ for non-zero $$a$$. Here, one needs to gather some ideas. Any non-zero $$a$$ has an inverse $$\\pmod p$$, as $$gcd(a,p)=1$$ when $$p$$ is prime. Thus, we can say that the set $$\\{a,2a,3a,\\ldots,(p-1)a\\}$$ consists of distint elements and thus must be the same set as $$\\{1,\\ldots,(p-1)\\}$$ modulo $$p$$. Then, we proceed by noting the product of the elements of the &#34;two&#34; sets are the same, but have different form. From here, can you finish?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some sense, this isn&#39;t even enough to just know the basic proofs. We then ask questions like show that $$a^{(p-1)(q-1)} = 1 \\mod{pq}$$ on the exam! Here, the proof is the same, one needs to work with the set $$\\{x \\in\\{1,\\ldots pq-1\\} | gcd(x,pq) = 1\\}$$ as they have inverses and do a bit more work. Oh my! But this is fine. You can do it! Just play with the ideas, a little bijection, a little bit about inverses. Turn over the proof a couple of times to see how it works. Teach someone the proof to see if you have it. But do try to\u00a0 have it completely, if not then, eventually. Indeed, I sometimes sit up in the middle of the night because I got some aspect of some explanation wrong to some student.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One thing though that makes this very difficult, would be doing all this while thinking about how &#34;not good&#34; at math one is. One needs to use your significant mental resources to play with the ideas not to engage in fear or self doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I should note even Terry Tao had doubts at times; indeed, he was once led out of an exam room in tears.\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">See here.</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given your performance in 61A and 61B, these ideas are easily within your grasp.

As someone taking 70 right now I understand the dreadful &#34;shaky&#34; feeling about the material- I felt the same in the few weeks leading up to the midterm. I also sunk a lot of time into reading the notes and extra resources. However, when it came to the first two or three homeworks I was a mess- couldn&#39;t even get started on some problems, and the ones I could do I ended up getting completely wrong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In your post you don&#39;t mention office hours, homework parties, or study groups so I&#39;m not sure if you tried those at all. If not, my advice would be to lean on those heavily next time you take it. What I found helped the most was a large amount of time face-to-face with someone who knew the material well- may that be a TA in OH who was going through the notes with me or a friend\u00a0in my study group who was working with me to construct a solution to a HW problem. This really benefited me because the other person was able to gauge my understanding real-time, help me understand the stuff I was missing, and correct any misconceptions that I had. It worked really well- I ended up getting &#43;1 std dev on the midterm. IMO learning CS 70 is a dialogue- you learn by bouncing my thoughts and ideas off other people and listening to the responses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I agree with Prof. Sahai on the problem of self-studying- reading the notes and doing the HW in a vacuum allowed me to form these misconceptions that went unchecked until I talked it over with someone else. Perhaps you can find resources this semester to help you prepare\u00a0even though you&#39;re not in the class. I know there are clubs that offer tutoring for CS 70 (HKN comes to mind).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don&#39;t get yourself down on being &#34;horrible at math&#34;- this is about hard work, not intrinsic talent!

I&#39;m just horrible at math.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My plan would be taking the course this summer, while self studying 70 material and other math material. I only have 13 units so I would have some time to self study. What would people recommend? Will it be any easier in the summer if I only take CS70? Is there going to be a CSM section for summer? If not, would that negatively impact me? I don&#39;t want to get an A, I just want to get something that is not a C or lower like I would&#39;ve gotten if I continued in the course.
