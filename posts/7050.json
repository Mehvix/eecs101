Ask yourself how you can connect issues in vision to what you have learned. The material in 16AB is foundational, but there are application-specific perspectives\u00a0that obviously are not in the lower-division. For these, you need to look online at resources about computer vision if you want to try doing something before actually getting to the upper div and grad courses on the topic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The best thing is to actually talk to a graduate student or a more senior undergrad who is doing research in computer vision. Say you know least-squares, matching pursuit, PCA, k-means, and finite Fourier transforms like the DFT, and you are familiar with how eigenvalues relate to PageRank on graphs as well as basic concepts of stability for simple control systems. Say you&#39;ve built a simple hyperplane-based classifier for speech signals as well as played around with localization using audio. But you know nothing about vision-specific feature extraction or concerns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to play around with something on your own, ask how you would take a 16AB lab/project, and make it have a vision component instead. Examples: can you take the dual-photography (multi-pixel imaging) lab, and using the simulator, ask if you can improve the reconstructions using a neural net as compared to adapting matching-pursuit ideas to work in the transform domain. Can you then adapt a standard computer vision approach to deal with raw data being acquired by multi-pixel imaging using a single-pixel imager? Can you figure out how to combine ideas from localization lab with vision? (Make a simulator or find a way to render fake images in a toy world first.) Can you figure out how you&#39;d give vision-based commands to your robot car?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Knowing how to program isn&#39;t usually the bottleneck. This is why, unlike many other places, we don&#39;t have a programming-only lower division for our majors. With just programming, you would be restricted to paint-by-numbers-style work.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2018-05-23T06:54:50Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "jhir73zdc37pa", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"j6fe5friemd22w": 1512183636}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isb5ly067aa5ly", "name": "Zeyana Musthafa", "photo": "1526967807_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/isb5ly067aa5ly/1526967807_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j30yp45ijoz6b2", "name": "Felipe Campos", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["isb5ly067aa5ly", "j30yp45ijoz6b2"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-20T07:04:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs", "lscs", "peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Hi, I am having trouble starting out with a personal project.
