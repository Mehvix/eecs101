It seems like a cool product, and they hired one of Yann LeCunn&#39;s former mentees so evidently their tech is legit. But the Glassdoor ratings are pretty disturbing--many complaints about frat boy culture / lack of professionalism / harassment (I&#39;m a guy by the way FWIW). I would also recommend searching on Blind for Verkada posts. You might be able to find more stuff there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, during their tech talk they demo&#39;d some of their cameras in their office, and I thought it was a recording since there were plenty of people walking around mask-less. But then they said &#34;here is a livestream of our office blah blah blah oh haha looks like mask compliance isn&#39;t so great today.&#34; I was pretty surprised that a Bay Area tech company hasn&#39;t gone WFH yet, and I would be wary of company culture that does stuff like mandate in-person working with loose mask enforcement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No idea what Lucid does or what the company is like, so no input there.
