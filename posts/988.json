Given the current market demand/supply of hardware and software talents, I think software definitely is &#39;hotter&#39; than hardware. If you have been to any career fair held in Berkeley, you will know the validity of my statement. I transferred to EECS because of better job prospect (one of many reasons) but I had a hard time deciding which side to do. At the beginning, I also abhorred coding simply because I didn&#39;t have as much experience as other students but in retrospect, those differences in experience can be made up easily. Now getting to your question, I want to emphasize that EE is a labor of love. You cannot do it if you don&#39;t love it. You cannot do it if you simply choose it because you don&#39;t like coding. (EE involves a lot of coding too!) In terms of marketable skills, you will not easily acquire them from just taking classes. In order to be employable, you need longer years of learning and training and switching specialization even within the field can be hard. So from my perspective, do EE if you absolutely like it and you value your love for hardware more than immediate monetary return. Also be ready for graduate school. (If you hate school and just want to starting working already, then EE may not be your top pick) I understand what you are feeling since I have been on this path before.

In particular, to the line\u00a0&#34;absolutely abhor coding.&#34; If anyone thinks that &#34;EE&#34; jobs don&#39;t involve being proficient in writing computer code, they are mistaken. There are a couple of aspects of EECS where you really don&#39;t have a choice --- (a) you must be proficient at writing computer code and thinking in a logical fashion; and (b) you must be able to handle mathematical modeling and thinking. \u00a0Now, in practice in industry, there are definitely paths where someone might not have to do (b). But honestly, the only paths that I know where someone might be able to avoid writing computer code require getting a PhD (or MBA) and then having people working for you who write the computer code. But then, you probably will have to write some computer code while doing your PhD (or while getting the work experience for the MBA) so there is really no escape.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And culturally as an engineer, you should not *want* to escape something like this.\u00a0Consequently,\u00a0if you say you don&#39;t like coding\u00a0and you&#39;re a freshman, then it probably just means that you need to get better at it. Once you get good at it, then it may very well be that you don&#39;t get a big thrill out of writing code. That&#39;s fine.\u00a0Be sure you choose paths that have aspects that you do find deeply rewarding. (Life is too short to spend working on\u00a0stuff that doesn&#39;t engage you as a person.) Coding isn&#39;t the kind of thing that someone can truly abhor.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just because our degree requirements let people take course paths which minimize writing code or doing math, it doesn&#39;t mean that taking those course paths is necessarily a good idea.
