You should study abroad if you want to get to know another country/culture more in depth than traveling would bring. I would recommend study abroad in the fall so you get to finish your last semester at Cal. Sometimes it&#39;s harder to study abroad in the Spring depending on Berkeley being weird with final confirmation of degree stuff or because a lot of Spring programs end in June, in which case you might not be able to walk/get your transcripts to Berkeley in time. If you do really want to study abroad in the spring, I recommend you apply independently of Berkeley, which is what one of my friends is doing. She just graduated from Berkeley in the fall and got her degree. She applied independently to a program that ends before May. Berkeley has no knowledge of this/the classes don&#39;t count as her degree so there&#39;s no wait or clearing of degree stuff. Cons are that you have to research a lot on your own and apply independently and figure out everything by yourself.</p>\n<p>-Graduate a semester early and start work right away? Do this if you&#39;re just totally ready to move on and are really excited at your future company. You&#39;ll also save a lot of money/make money!</p>\n<p>-Graduate a semester early and travel? You should do this if you really love traveling and just want to visit a ton of places. A lot of my friends have also done this. They graduated early and took the entire semester and summer to travel because that&#39;s what they love to do, see new places and learn about the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I decided to stay because I didn&#39;t feel closure after\u00a03.5 years. I had a job lined up and took all my fun classes for the fall. However,\u00a0I am\u00a0going to be moving away from the area after graduation. I wanted to be around my friends for longer and also to try some last opportunities at school. Also, money isn&#39;t an issue for me or something I considered being worth while to save compared the the experience I would be missing (especially since EECS salaries are so high comparatively to other majors). I decided against study abroad because I realized that I don&#39;t actually care that much about really learning about and living in another country. I love traveling and I did want to go abroad, but just in the traveling sense, and so I&#39;m doing that this summer. Mainly, I decided to stay because I didn&#39;t feel closure. I have some worries or last things I had to sort out before graduating. Some people just really want to get out of Berkeley because it&#39;s stressful, but when I was on the verge of graduation, I was just sad I&#39;d never get to learn for the sake of learning or be as closely connected with people like in the college environment again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let me know what you&#39;re looking for and I can give you some suggestions! ^_^</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "gru0m5sforh", "updated": "2015-03-04T08:44:02Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2015-03-18T22:25:30Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "no", "content": "<p>I would suggest studying abroad, since it&#39;s a wonderful experience. \u00a0(Traveling abroad isn&#39;t really the same... you get a different taste of things by actually living in the country and meeting local students, etc.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do make sure you talk to your advisor to ensure that senior residency requirements are satisfied before you decide to go abroad. \u00a0Also note that the deadline for summer programs should be coming shortly.</p>", "created": "2015-03-18T22:25:30Z", "subject": "", "uid": "grs17gxlxgg"}], "id": "i7fas3pdoau2b1", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "h61cxrcrad01f", "name": "Eric Quach", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["h61cxrcrad01f", "iscem14kbsu5vi"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"bypass_email": true}, "created": "2015-03-03T07:17:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["other", "cs"], "history": [{"anon": "full", "content": "<p>I am currently a junior, and I am taking my 5th and 6th CS upper div.
