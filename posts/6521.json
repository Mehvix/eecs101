However, also getting used to working with bits, memory, and other concepts that are not as frequently dealt with in the other cs61 courses is another huge reason why 61c is a huge help for 161 in general, not just the first part of the course.</p>", "created": "2018-04-09T06:08:03Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_2"}, {"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I think taking 161 without 61C under your belt would be extremely difficult, especially in the beginning of the semester.
