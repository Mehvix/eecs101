My advice is to go through the slides / to OH before starting to make sure you fully understand the details of symmetric/asymmetric cryptography, because project 2 is graded on security, not functionality (and you are only given functionality tests to test locally).</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-05-01T15:01:57Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-05-01T05:52:24Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jgn9a2tug5n5o5", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>If 168 projects are being revamped, I&#39;m not sure how helpful this will be, but last Fall there were 3 relatively light projects (5-20 hours each and no partners), 1 midterm, and a final.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2018-05-01T05:52:24Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-04-30T02:58:00Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "peer_directed", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "Professor Shenker said the 168 projects will be &#34;revampled&#34;.
