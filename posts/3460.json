This practically means the mathematical maturity acquired by taking EE16AB and/or Math 53/54. In our experience, students who lack the appropriate level of mathematical maturity tend to find CS70 excruciatingly painful and CS70 is a reasonably hard course even for those who have the mathematical maturity it expects.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The EECS department believes that all the lower division courses are pretty vital. It&#39;s not even so much about the specific technical details that you learn, although those are important and useful. It is about the perspectives, context, and ways of thinking. That is what really helps you in the long term. Taking these courses is about helping you ask questions as much as it is about helping you answer them. Others can often help you answer questions when you are working. Fewer folks are available to help you ask questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That said, there are a vast range of software development jobs out there and knowing 61AB, 70, 170, 160, and 188 is actually not a very weak foundation, as long as you work hard to keep on learning. The lack of 61C\u00a0would be\u00a0a pretty glaring hole though. 61C and 162 are very important perspectives for a practical software developer, especially if they are ever want to be engaged in work that demands high performance. Real-world performance is often less about Big-O issues and more about cache misses.</p>", "created": "2017-02-28T23:23:25Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "izq5sz0v9as6qa", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {"global": 1554662529, "iodbabo3p981z3": 1, "iy2218fmis837o": 1, "jcgyh2gxeeq2i": 1525561791, "jl2h2s08saj10h": 1543962104, "jr82w490pjf3x5": 1556926405}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy040fqd1kp", "name": "Divyansh Agarwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ipkfrd85xkt1zi", "name": "Muying Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idrin4yxhispa", "name": "Lakshya Jain", "photo": "1474747210_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idrin4yxhispa/1474747210_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idkkv297xks6ot", "name": "Vivian Liu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"idj0i2vuu8x222": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktwxobua7547n", "name": "Mike Ambrose", "photo": "1484676769_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hktwxobua7547n/1484676769_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9qynt5gz9", "name": "Suraj Rampure", "photo": "1567650161_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p9qynt5gz9/1567650161_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1, "ireb05q4pq01oe": 1, "irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "name": "Nitzan Orr", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijhjb1ju3eb2bi", "name": "Riley Price", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "id3qobx0t824u8", "name": "Katherine Elizabeth Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8idxhub7pd", "name": "Daniel Zhang", "photo": "1471923062_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p8idxhub7pd/1471923062_35.png", "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iscem14kbsu5vi", "name": "Keerthi Bhattaram", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["icguy040fqd1kp", "ipkfrd85xkt1zi", "idrin4yxhispa", "idkkv297xks6ot", "hktwxobua7547n", "is6p9qynt5gz9", "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "ijhjb1ju3eb2bi", "id3qobx0t824u8", "is6p8idxhub7pd", "iscem14kbsu5vi"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-02-28T19:34:32Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["cs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I&#39;m a cognitive science major and I know that they usually end up going into Artificial intelligence, but I won&#39;t end up taking Machine learning before I graduate and I haven&#39;t taken math 1b, math 53 or math 54. I will end up taking intro to AI and cs70 though, is that enough? Is it really difficult for CogSci majors to land a successful career as a software applications developer after college? What other CS fields do cogsci majors usually end up in and what upper divs would I need in order to be successful in it? With the time I have left I most likely will only be able to take intro to AI, efficient algorithms, and user interface design and development, but I think I can maybe fit in another one depending on what its prerequistes are. This is just kinda worrying me because I dont want to end up stuck in an area I am not all that interested in. Also, how important is cs61C? I heard its not very important for most programmers, is that true?</p>", "created": "2017-02-28T19:34:32Z", "subject": "Computer science careers for Cognitive science Majors", "uid_a": "a_0"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "izpxmlvtxrk6lz", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer": 0, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 3460, "num_favorites": 4, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654552884595, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6wwiv4d5qj", "name": "Michelle Fan", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hqvjyc84cwv1l2", "name": "Alfonso Martinez", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idt1ud37ujgza", "name": "Enrique Lopez", "photo": "1501361959_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/idt1ud37ujgza/1501361959_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p6wwiv4d5qj", "hqvjyc84cwv1l2", "idt1ud37ujgza"], "tags": ["cs", "student"], "type": "question", "unique_views": 672}
