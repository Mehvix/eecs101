However, if you&#39;re like me and you aren&#39;t able to devote all your time to it/don&#39;t like architecture that much, it may just be a huge pain.

There are a lot of concepts that need to be covered in an extremely short amount of time, which meant that I didn&#39;t really get a chance to focus on the interesting bits and had to slog out the remainder of the material. 61C is a really good introduction to low level CS and will prepare you well for any of the 16x classes while giving you a solid foundational understanding of how a computer works. 61C moves fast and is a decent amount of work (esp. some of the projects, oh boy).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My personal opinion is that 170 is the second best class I&#39;ve ever taken at Cal.

From a coursework perspective, I think 170 moves at a proper pace so you can cover the material efficiently while making sure you learn all of it and everything ties together pretty well in my opinion. 170 should prepare you well for any other sort of theory work you want to do in the future (complexity, approximations, etc) and should prepare you at least somewhat well for 188 and some grad classes. 170 I think is the easiest of the classes listed here since it really sets you up to succeed.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p9mf96y2ty", "name": "Henry Muller", "photo": "1484632252_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/is6p9mf96y2ty/1484632252_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p9mf96y2ty", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-01-23T19:01:23Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/19 - 1/25", "bucket_order": 85, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 1/19 - 1/25", "bucket_order": 85, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-01-24T01:51:45Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "k5rietoxc2o3sq", "subject": "<p>Same poster as f3, I think 188 was actually the best class I took here.

I found I was fairly lost after 70 and 188 did an excellent job to ground the knowledge I gained in 70 and made the material a lot easier to understand in the end. Also, I think the course is set up in a way that helps students succeed by covering the material at a good pace that allows you to understand what&#39;s going on without being lost.\u00a0 I didn&#39;t find 188 that time intensive and have heard that 189 is a significant amount of work.
