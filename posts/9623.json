Over all I feel like you are having a well-rounded ML &#43; SWE path, and you clearly make some good plan to dive into classes like 127 and 189. I&#39;ll make some comments on the courses I&#39;ve taken and the courses that I&#39;m planning to take and have done a lot of survey on (here and friends who already took them).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your Fall 2019 looks fine to me. Data8 is kind of a subset of 61A. 16A is not that hard in general if you are familiar with lin alg.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your Spring 2020 will be significantly harder than Fall 2019 in my opinion, but doable if you are already familiar with data structure and willing to commit your whole time into the courses.</p>\n<p>61B and 100 both have heavy projects (Instructors are adding more workload and material into 100). 16B&#39;s homework and labs are much more challenging than 16A. So the overall workload is like triple the Fall2019.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your current Fall 2020 plan will be insane... 170 and 61C is enough for a semester. 127, 170 both have weekly hw assignments that\u00a0are VERY challenging, 61C is also notoriously being heavy-workload-- prob the most heavy-workload lower div classes in EECS. I suggest you taking 61C during the 2020 summer(170 and 127 are not offering during the summer) then this semester&#39;s plan will be doable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don&#39;t have too much to say about later semesters. But I feel like you need to do some review for prob. theory before 126 since it&#39;s a challenging class. You take 70 a year ago in summer before 126 and all the courses in between do not really address the content of prob. theory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just my two cents.
