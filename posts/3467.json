Ideally, a Berkeley style engineer who can work on things that push the boundaries and not just filling in the blanks. \u00a0Engineers who can contribute to make society better and advancing the state of knowledge, while learning. How classes do this is by helping you think about things more clearly. When I was an undergraduate, there were things said in lecture that were never on an exam or a HW that still ended up helping me years later. If a student\u00a0thinks that a class is about doing well on the homework or on exams or getting a good grade, the student is missing the point. If the student thinks the point of the course is to teach them a particular tool that they can use in industry, they are also missing the point. They should be paying attention and trying to internalize how we are thinking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Bachelor&#39;s degree is meant to prepare you for being an apprentice --- to learn productively from masters who are working\u00a0in the field. There are going to be many practical skills associated with both software engineering in general as well as particular application domains that you will have to learn in the field. In general, the time at Berkeley is precious and what you could learn better in industry should be left to be taught to you there. Details (and particular tools) are easy to learn in industry, but big pictures are harder. This is because real life has lots of details. Knowing how to remove the details and see the essence is the skill that is hard to learn in industry precisely because the essence alone is never enough. But the essence is critical for making strategic decisions. However, when people start out, they don&#39;t usually get to make strategic decisions. So there is a gap --- a time during which you are learning a lot in industry and not seeing the full advantage of your Berkeley education. This is fine from our point of view --- we are teaching you with the time-scale of decades in our mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-03-02T21:06:45Z", "subject": "", "uid":

I was in 61A at the time, and we had just learned to use dictionaries (the Python kind, of course) and so I though it would be fun to do things like word count on a couple texts we were given as well as some basic statistics and to find data to explore the same topics. It was nothing super rigorous, but I found it to be a good way to practice Python \u00a0(of which I needed lots of practice them!) and to explore the topic in a way that I figured most people would not. Based on what I learned from messing around I used that to write the reading response which gave me a bit more depth and thus made the word count thing easier. :) I mean, I can BS\u00a0my way to a word count any day [hello AP courses!] but assignments are much more fun when you can complete them without needing to do that.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "grqtsu85iy0", "updated": "2017-03-04T08:03:07Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-03T08:50:59Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "iztkyjwo48n3tj", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I think Prof. Sahai&#39;s answer is a really good high-level answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of these questions also don&#39;t have specific answers -- I don&#39;t believe the CS department has specific goals for graduates other than that they are successful. But two obvious goals are the UCB CS graduates should be competitive candidates for top engineering jobs and graduate schools. However, the path to graduate school is not necessarily the same as the path to the software industry (that really depends on a lot of factors). Ideally, students should feel comfortable pursuing their dreams. (Which is admittedly cheesy, but I believe accurately so).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Courses at Berkeley are numbered in various buckets, most coarsely: Lower division, Upper Division, Graduate Level. (0XX, 1XX, 2XX, respectively.)

Each course (i.e. CS161) has a syllabus that&#39;s approved by campus that covers the basic concepts that are expected to be covered, but each offering may adapt as course staff\u00a0want to try different approaches or make adjusts for what may be changing goals. So, if you&#39;re curious about a particular course--just ask! Faculty (typically) love waxing poetic about their course designs and aspirations for their courses. It&#39;s no easy task, and it&#39;s always nice to hear from interested students.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, I want to caution you (or anyone), that your personal learning and a life goals may not match up with those of a particular course. I took plenty of courses during my time as a student where my goals were somewhat different than the courses. In those cases I focused most strongly on the aspects that aligned well, and learned what I could from the other stuff. For smaller courses or project based ones, I made sure to take any flexibility I had, and adapt it to my interests. For example in non-CS courses I would explore problems by using small programs and data to make an argument. Naturally, writing code to finish a writing reading response isn&#39;t necessary (or something I recommend for everyone), but at the time it was a fun way to be personally and academically productive, and whenever I&#39;ve done things like professors are almost always receptive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "grqtsu85iy0", "updated": "2017-03-03T08:50:59Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-03-02T07:07:42Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": {}, "folders": ["eecs", "cs", "peer_directed", "other"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I was talking to an alum who graduated in the early 2000s, and he was talking about being a good software engineer vs. computer scientist.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t fully understand the distinction between the two.
