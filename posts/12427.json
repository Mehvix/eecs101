For me personally, I think I wish I took 16B before 127 but I know people who did take 127 without 16B and found it fine. As for 189, I feel like it\u2019s a very standalone class (given that you know stats and linear algebra from beforehand). So I never felt at a disadvantage during 189. Stats 134 and math 54 is excellent preparation for 189 (I had 53, 54, and 70 and did well). I don\u2019t think 53 is necessary to do well in 189 but you should just be able to pick it up as you go (just things like Hessians and gradients)</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kdo94dnotzp1e5": 1608068756, "ke3tewrxmn57lj": 1604516868, "kfn3pakx2el278": 1608298900}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ju4j3glepcg39x", "name": "Thee Ho", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ju4j3glepcg39x"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2020-06-06T23:00:16Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 6/7 - 6/13", "bucket_order": 74, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 10/18 - 10/24", "bucket_order": 55, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-10-23T02:15:49Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kglmhc5ixlqte", "subject": "<p>What is your opinion on taking 126 in the same semester as 70?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_3", "updated": "2020-10-23T02:15:49Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 10/18 - 10/24", "bucket_order": 55, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-10-23T12:59:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kgm9gmjswhc1u7", "subject": "<p>definitely not recommended, tbh a good standing in cs 70 is the prerequisite for an average score in 126. 126 depends significantly on probability, which CS 70 introduces on.
