However, when I check my Academic Progress Report, it doesn&#39;t look like math53 is being used to fulfill this requirement. I&#39;m supposed to graduate after this semester so I wanted to double check that I have everything in order. I will post screenshots of my APR along with descriptions of things that seem incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This first screenshot shows that I have indeed transferred my math53 course.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fjcaujj6gag85jn%2F9fa3a152c7f1ca72047adfa39621ad605805603a819048474c5daf6a7e5ef264%2Fmath53.png\" alt=\"math53.png\" width=\"658\" height=\"383\" /></p>\n<p>This screenshot shows that DATA100 is being used to satisfy my CS Upper Division Elective credits, instead of INFO253b and MATH53 as desired. So, what should be here is INFO253a, INFO253b, and MATH53.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fjcaujj6gag85jn%2F02fea4131796e7e07c810f4103e03b5346b91f745362cc10bd9820fc67852578%2Fdat.png\" alt=\"dat.png\" width=\"622\" height=\"352\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This final screenshot shows that as a result of the above situation, my required 16 Upper Division CS units are not being satisfied. DATA100 should be here, alongside CS170, CS186, and CS161. But, DATA100 is not there because it&#39;s currently being used to satisfy the Elective section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fjcaujj6gag85jn%2F6bce9d51a751a8a2fd74768fc9fea7d5462b3190dfd269c7925bb94d017aeab7%2Fmissing.png\" alt=\"missing.png\" width=\"566\" height=\"269\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If someone can help me resolve this issue, that would be greatly appreciate. Or if anyone could point me to someone I can talk to.
