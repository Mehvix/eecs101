We are the first open-membership consulting club (all you need to submit is an application, and you will be assigned (at a minimum) the position of consultant). Juniors, Seniors, and Transfer students are encouraged to apply and receive priority for our higher positions! We work on client and non-client based projects, so you will have the opportunity to work with a team. Our consulting division has 5 client based projects with high impact startups (including a SkyDeck Company!) this semester. This includes technical and non-technical projects. Our non-client based projects (Project BUILD division) are driven by our applicants. You will have the opportunity to work with a team. Our only requirements are 1) a $15 membership fee (scholarship offered if requested), 2) application submitted on time, 3) attend all meetings (unless excused) and complete duties. Projects are assigned based based on applicants&#39; preferences, experience, and applicant pool. No experience is required for our non-client based projects. Deadlines for PM/Exec apps are Feb. 12th at 11:59pm and Consultants/Engineers/Designers apps are due on Feb. 19th at 11:59pm.
