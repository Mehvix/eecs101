I feel that courses should be taken when you are prepared to take them and you shouldn&#39;t feel a need to rush unless spring is your last semester or something. You miss out of all the benefits if you are constantly struggling in a class. This is fine if the class is hard, but totally not ok if it is because you did not take a pre-requisite ahead and have the time to do it. Even if you declare by the end of sophomore year you should be in track to graduate in time and still experiment a lot (unless you want to take every single class in the CS department which would not be the best idea in the world either). Just my two cents, take 61b, take 70 and then take 170.
