A lot of the way the class will be run is up in the air currently, as we are waiting for more campus guidelines. Discussions will likely be offered in-person and remotely. There will definitely be an online lab option available. However, we can&#39;t guarantee the availability of in-person labs. That will be decided after our lab room gets evaluated for occupancy and safety.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remote labs will be brand new this semester, and you won&#39;t be able to work with hardware. This style will also require you to install a VM to run simulations and have a computer that&#39;s capable of handling that. While you won&#39;t have to deal with pesky hardware bugs, you&#39;ll also be the first students to try these labs so may encounter other (potentially more frustrating) bugs instead--and ones that TAs haven&#39;t seen before so may need more time debugging and helping. We are trying to keep the content across both styles of lab the same, but remote restrictions just won&#39;t allow us to do certain tasks that involve physically being with a robot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can&#39;t speak to the worth of delaying next year. Honestly, given how poorly America as a whole is handling the virus situation and safety/health guidelines traditionally held for vaccines, we might still be stuck in this style of learning for a year. I personally came from a background of competitive robotics, so I loved being able to work physically with the robots and build more physical intuition with the robots. However, I have full faith in our staff to be able to provide an equally compelling, enriching semester remotely--even if it&#39;s fulfilling in a different way. We&#39;ve been hard at work all summer to make this possible!\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hope that helps!</p>", "created": "2020-07-04T18:17:43Z", "subject": "", "uid": "itqgloqqhfi3xg"}], "id": "kc7yysgwhsu7co", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6xz4atuxp82ko", "name": "Zaynah Javed", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "name": "Rishi Veerapaneni", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"jpslgn3m4lsk6": 1555223627}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jhobhold1yokb", "name": "Kaushik Sankar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkkw4sr227", "name": "Prabhman Dhaliwal", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p8brfrzt7az", "name": "Amay Saxena", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jktvi1qs1256nt", "name": "Haochen Gao", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jmfdrw30boCs", "name": "Jeff Chen", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "name": "David Au", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6nu4j7a2be46b", "name": "Shaantam Chawla", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j6xz4atuxp82ko", "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "jhobhold1yokb", "j6gtkkw4sr227", "is6p8brfrzt7az", "jktvi1qs1256nt", "jmfdrw30boCs", "hktxrlgmmzm3jh", "j6nu4j7a2be46b"], "type": "s_answer"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [{"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Last week", "bucket_order": 6, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2020-07-05T06:42:27Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kc8pkiqimay1s0", "subject": "<p>I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable promising that.
