Property testing has its roots in the program checking and PCP literature, but has evolved into a thriving area of its own standing between algorithms and complexity theory; results are often characterized by relatively simple algorithms that are supported by a fairly complex analysis.<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Topics covered include testing properties of boolean functions (linearity, dictatorship, juntas), testing algebraic properties of functions (low-degreeness in various settings), testing graph properties (in the dense graph model, bipartiteness, colorability, triangle-freeness), and testing with the aid of provers. Emphasis is on getting students up to speed for research in the area; lectures will often contain open problems or suggestions for future research.</p>", "created": "2016-08-11T01:50:36Z", "subject": "[course announcement] CS294: Property Testing - W 1pm to 4pm", "uid": "ie55h4trwsg7hr"}], "i_edits": [], "id": "irpo45rjiqp4do", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 1871, "num_favorites": 0, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654554832109, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"ids66zeithd2ov": 1, "ijltj19y6lv59e": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hlx51hr3snv1zn", "name": "Yiqun Chen", "photo": "1454110371_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hlx51hr3snv1zn/1454110371_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "icguy7zcbbi1qg", "name": "Peter Manohar", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hlx51hr3snv1zn", "icguy7zcbbi1qg"], "tags": ["announcements", "student"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 258}
