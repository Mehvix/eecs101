I took 61B with Hilfinger and 16B with Sahai and I think this class beats the courseload of both. You are working on at least one of their assignments every day in a week and projects are almost released immediately after one another. So, I don&#39;t know how that will work out with both 61B and 61C. It is not a conceptually heavy class, but just a lot of assignments. I would highly recommend against taking 61B and 61C together, even if it is the case that you described. My friend switched into EECS in his sophomore year and took 61B in his second sem sophomore year and is still fine. You might want to take 61C in Summer. And I doubt if 61C will help you with interviews relating to SWE Internships. It is more helpful for Computer Architecture internships/Hardware internships. So, if you are looking into those, probably 61C will be more useful. But, for SWE 61B will definitely be more helpful than 61C.</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j6gtkmujgst23w", "name": "Nicholas Nolan", "photo": "1563649904_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j6gtkmujgst23w/1563649904_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j6gtkmujgst23w"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jjs6ge7urqc129", "updated": "2020-10-11T09:54:29Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"11911": 9, "12093": 1, "12772": 7, "13157": 6, "4317": 8, "5769": 0, "5770": 2, "8177": 3, "9529": 4, "9583": 5}}, "created": "2020-10-11T09:33:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello,\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will be taking only these two classes plus Data100 OR an easy breadth.
