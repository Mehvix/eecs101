Most\u00a0people on piazza seem to agree with the other student&#39;s answer above. But personally, I feel like I would have struggled a lot more if I went into cs61c without cs61b experience, at least for the first 1/3 of the course. In the semester I took cs 61c, the first homework assignment was to implement tries and TSTs in C, which required some knowledge of the said data structures and also the ability to pick up C quite fast. That said, not everyone who has only taken cs61a and has never learned Java or other C-family languages is going to be able to pick up C at the speed the course staff expects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>tl;dr - If your only CS experience is cs61a (like myself), I recommend taking cs61b first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- If you already have some experience with Java/C, and data structures in general, go ahead if you wish.</p>", "created": "2018-03-27T01:30:43Z", "subject": "", "uid_a": "a_1"}, {"anon": "no", "content": "<p>The two classes are basically unrelated and you should be fine taking 61C first.

Tries and TSTs. Be mindful about taking 61c without 61b if you are not aware of Data Structures. My project partner for 61a took 61b and 61c together. The two classes seem to complement pretty well. 61c will give you kind of a bump for 61b if you are taking them concurrently, but at the beginning it might be hard, because of the reasons mentioned above. He did tell me that he was very happy with his decision. Dan Garcia is a great professor and you will learn a lot from him, but I really encourage you to take 61b first or take them concurrently, or you might find yourself lost at many times (ignore this if you felt SUPER confident with 61a and scored on the A/A&#43; range, or feel that you can learn\u00a061b by yourself before taking 61c)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid": "is0vls53gakb4", "updated": "2018-03-28T07:46:58Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-28T06:08:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jfaovvvrs0h6w6", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Do you know which data structures / algorithms I should be comfortable with?</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2018-03-28T06:08:33Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-03-27T00:56:33Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["peer_directed"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Is this feasible?
