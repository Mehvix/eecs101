It was quite a high workload; I spent about 20 - 30 hours per week doing homework. The hardest part was that neither classes are &#34;easy&#34; to grasp. They are very mathematical and require a lot of time before you can understand what happened during lecture (especially EECS 126 which is supposed to be an advanced upper-div). Of course, how long you would spend on the courses depends on your mathematical maturity (for reference, I was coming straight out of CS 70 without any other math or math-intensive CS courses). If you are ready to spend time grinding through the math and taking your time to appreciate the course material, I would really advise taking them, because they are great courses to build your foundations despite being high-workload.\u00a0</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-01-25T00:41:05Z"}, {"bucket_name": "Today", "bucket_order": 3, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-01-28T07:03:30Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "folders": [], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I did it &#43; one L&amp;s breadth and got an A in all.
