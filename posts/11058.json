However, I enjoyed 110 partly because I love linear algebra as a subject, but also because the way its taught made me a much better mathematician - it really forces you to think more abstractly and become familiar with proofs.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, for OP&#39;s specific situation, it seems like you already have a math background if you are planning to take 126 and 127 (and presumably have taken 70 and 16ab/54), so the additional benefit of 110 may not be enough for you. I wanted to leave this up on the thread in case anybody else with a different background is in a similar situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On a last note, I took 110 in a semester with 4 techs, and i would say it was among the lighter of my workloads, because in my semester, the homework wasn&#39;t actually due to turn in. So I would spend several hours per week trying the homework, but didn&#39;t stress as much if I couldn&#39;t figure one out, and would just diligently go over the solutions when released. This saved me a lot of time compared to traditional classes. However, I am not sure if this policy is the same for whoever is teaching it in the spring, and 110&#43;126&#43;127 is still a lot of psets to handle per week ;) (the other three techs I took with were a mix of psets and projects so I could switch it up a bit)</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is9ein4lpno52m", "updated": "2019-12-31T02:47:35Z"}], "config": {"seen": {"10399": 0, "3633": 5, "3688": 3, "3711": 4, "5223": 9, "5239": 7, "6653": 8, "7272": 1, "7594": 2, "9373": 6}}, "created": "2019-12-30T05:33:07Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrollments"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Definitely taking 126, 127, breadth, reader (13 units), but was wondering whether to add 188 or 110 on top of this.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reasons for 188: I likely want to do ML stuff in the future and really really wanna get started in AI stuff, which is why I wanted to add 188.
