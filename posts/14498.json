Ideally you'd want to take one of 126 or 127 before 189. I have found that 127 is more useful\n\nIf you're interested in quant research/trading, then take:\n126 and maybe some stats classes like 135. I cannot comment on the usefulness of stats classes however as I have not taken them myself\n\nIf you're interested in quant SWE, then take:\n162\n\nI can speak from experience for the first and last ones but I have not gotten a quant research/trader internship so I cannot comment on the best strategy for that. I have done interviews for quant trader/research and most of them are doable given just what you learn in 126, some of them are doable even with CS 70 knowledge. Most of those industrial engineering classes don't seem useful for what you're trying to do. I agree with Helix's comment to take 189 asap. 169 doesn't seem too useful given the general area of interest, most recommend just doing internships and I would agree with that sentiment.\n\nAfter taking CS 70 and EECS 16b, it is most logical to take one or both of 126 and 127. Needless to say, these are super useful classes for what you're interested in, and I also enjoyed them a lot. I am assuming you are currently a freshman, in which case I will say that it could be difficult to find quant research/trader internships for your sophomore-junior year summer given that you will not have covered much probability by the time recruiting season starts. If you care about finding a quant trader internship then I recommend going through some books on probability and perhaps even some books specific to quant interviews.\n\nI also saw another comment to take math 113 and math 110. You do not need to take either of these. I have taken math 113 formally and have self studied the material for math 110 (using the Axler book). Math 113 is almost completely useless for what you're interested in and math 110 might be too theoretical to the point where 127 is enough. Math 104 is useful for the research side of ML. If possible, I'd recommend trying to replace stat 134 with 126 if possible since the latter covers a lot more new concepts compared to CS 70 probability</md>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "name": "Gilbert Feng", "photo": "1611217973_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jzlnpqbvipc2ml/1611217973_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bzxodnue661", "name": "Juhee Hong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk0c403bzqx4da": 1613861355}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jwupbl14eqmsc", "name": "Vincent Porras", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["jzlnpqbvipc2ml", "ke2bzxodnue661", "jwupbl14eqmsc"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_4", "updated": "2021-03-01T07:38:57Z"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "seen": {"10185": 2, "11182": 4, "14095": 3, "14496": 0, "3185": 9, "3581": 1, "4907": 7, "4968": 8, "4982": 5, "7110": 6}}, "created": "2021-02-27T19:25:42Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["suggestion_box"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>I am an intended cs student and I need advice for course selection.
