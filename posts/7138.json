I&#39;d heard terrible stories about how CS 70 is ridiculously difficult and impossible to &#34;crack&#34;, so I was apprehensive to say the least. I took 70 with EE 105 and 130 and an easy humanities class, and, surprisingly, I&#39;d say I had probably the most successful semester I&#39;m likely to have at Cal. My high school prepared me pretty well for college-level physics and calculus, but I had very little to no exposure to probability before 70, and I can honestly say that 70 taught it much better than I expected (full credit to Babak) -- so much so that I&#39;m inclined to take more stats classes in the future, perhaps in grad school. I&#39;d say 70 is certainly a heavy-workload class (full disclosure: I took the test-only grading option and basically did the homework about 60% of the time, whenever 105 was not absolutely burning me alive), but its problems are of the kind of rigor that teaches you a lot if you put in the work. As for whether it&#39;s worthwhile or not, I feel that the only CS lower-div that has been more useful conceptually than 70 as an EE intern this summer has been 61C (basic programming aside-- I knew how to do that before 61AB). I work in optics and was presented with a datasheet describing the Gaussian nature of the intensity of light outputted by the lasers in our devices the third day of work and was blown away. So, yes, 70 is useful. And, for what it&#39;s worth, I enjoyed it more as a class than 61AB (though 61C was still my favorite CS lower div in terms of subject matter) and must say that the 70 staff is probably the best you will encounter at this (or maybe any) university. I&#39;d also like to note that 16AB did feel like very good preparation for 70 as I went through it (even though I still found 70 very difficult), so I wouldn&#39;t be scared if it&#39;s preparation you&#39;re worried about.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p815tz306kj", "updated": "2018-06-08T21:01:23Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2018-06-07T23:33:52Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "I&#39;m majoring in EECS, but I&#39;m only focusing on EE, is there any way I can get out of taking CS70?
