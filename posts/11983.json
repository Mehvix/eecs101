If you enjoy the material, this isn&#39;t a big deal, but for friends of mine who didn&#39;t, it can be pretty draining.

Very manageable if you have a consistent study group and/or are happy to spend some time in Office Hours. In my experience though this certainly hasn&#39;t been a class that I&#39;ve been able to just grind out on my own.
