I&#39;m a sophomore intended CS and I&#39;d like to get some advice. For reference, I have completed CS61AB and EE16AB, and I&#39;m taking CS70 and CS61C this semester. Currently I&#39;m waitlisted for CS170 and CS188 and enrolled in Math 53 for the spring semester. 188 and 170 finals are 3-6 PM and 7-10 PM Friday, which already seems rather spooky; the Math 53 final happens to be 11:30-2:30 PM on Friday as well. I&#39;ve been wrestling with\u00a0whether or not to switch out 188 or 53 or both classes for others such as CS 161 or CS 186. I&#39;ve heard that 170 and 188 are good classes to take together for a multitude of reasons; namely that it&#39;s nice to have one project centric and one problem set centric class, and that there&#39;s some overlap between the material in 170 and 188. Can someone who has taken those classes speak to whether or not there is significant benefit in that regard, or whether or not they are a good combination in general? With regards to 53, I&#39;m not entirely sure whether or not I should actually take the class; my intention is to eventually take CS 189. I&#39;ve taken EE16AB and plan on taking EE126 sometimes junior year, probably in the fall. I have not taken a college-level course on multivariable calculus,\u00a0though I am familiar with most of the topics listed on the Math 53 syllabus and willing to put in the time to self-study those I am not. Is it worth taking the course? Finally, somewhat tangentially: I&#39;ve heard that if one has 3 finals in the same day, there&#39;s some manner or method of rescheduling one of them? Some students have said to just email all of the professors, others have said that there&#39;s some form to fill out\u00a0through the department. I apologize if this information is available elsewhere on this Piazza or online, I searched for a little while and couldn&#39;t find anything.
