Having spoken to people who took 150, it was a class with extremely little in the way of substantial conceptual topics (it focused on logic blocks, adders, microarchitecture, etc.) but had a killer design project that took up most of the time students would dedicate to the course. 141, on the other hand, apparently focused on the circuits behind logic blocks and SRAM/DRAM and had relatively unremarkable labs revolving around drawing up schematics and layouts for these systems. Since these classes were not far removed from each other, and professors here may or may not like going out of their way to teach classes for undergrads, it was decided to merge them. 151 now has most of the conceptual material from the two classes, along with a slightly tuned-down version (i.e. you are designing a processor, but don&#39;t have to implement precise exceptions and other architectural features, etc. ) of 150&#39;s project, mapped to an FPGA lab (150 used FPGAs previously) and an ASIC lab (which draws more from 141). This makes for a decently challenging and, admittedly, often boring lecture series, with homework sets that can be difficult (this can be exacerbated by the fact that there seems to be very little beta-testing for the problems, which are thought up by the TAs). I took the FPGA lab, and in the first ~6 weeks we did a series of lab exercises to build familiarity with Verilog, before diving into the project. I&#39;d say that the initial labs entailed around 6-7 total hours of work per week, while the project involved around 10-15 total hours per week once it got started (this varied depending on the checkpoint). My numbers might be slightly off, but it also depends heavily on your partner(s). In terms of usefulness, I&#39;ve come across FPGAs in coursework and research plenty of times since 151, and I&#39;m very glad that I took the FPGA lab. Additionally, the final report is the kind of thing that you can provide during, say, the hiring process to show that you know your stuff, and 151 seems to be a crash-course on most of the topics that companies expect out of beginning hardware engineers. That being said, the ASIC lab seems very useful as well, and most IC / VLSI research involves prototyping with an FPGA before finalizing a design on an ASIC. It&#39;s not too uncommon to take one lab after the other to gain this full base of knowledge, but I haven&#39;t done it myself.
