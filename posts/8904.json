You get a coding test (this was pretty hard imo, but that&#39;s because the place I got the offer at wasn&#39;t expecting anyone to finish), a phone interview with some coding and some theory (I actually got asked to solve an approximation algorithm question), and finally an onsite interview. The onsite consisted of 4 interviews varying between low-level understanding (61C/162 material), algorithms/theory and writing cache-friendly implementations, and some abstract system/network design questions. Also theres a meeting with HR to test your personality. It was definitely harder than places like Google when I did their interviews, but not ridiculously so. Think of it like having the probability distribution of easy - medium - hard questions being more skewed to medium/hard than at a place like Google. Also, I got the sense that my answers were held to a higher standard, especially when I made a mistake or mispoke (correcting yourself and asking questions is important! There were topics\u00a0like networking which I didn&#39;t know, so I made that clear before trying to piece together a solution). Overall, its an interesting experience, but I don&#39;t think it requires wayyy more practice than normal tech companies. As a side note, I honestly don&#39;t think they pay all that much more at least to start out. The intern offer for the top fintech places are all more or less the same this summer (~12k &#43; housing &#43; benefits), which is way more than tech companies (~7-8k &#43; housing &#43; benefits), but the starting TC is around 225-250kish for all of them all in and around 200-215kish for a good tech company. You&#39;ll have to work way harder at a fintech company to impress people and last, and the culture is, in my opinion, toxic enough that I didn&#39;t find the whole career path worth the marginal boost in money (I prefer a laid back job). Though thats just my opinion.

For being a trader, the real question is how much stress can you handle? You&#39;re sometimes put in a position where your company can lose a lot of money if you make a dumb choice and it relies on you being smart and sometimes making quick correct decisions. That&#39;s just the nature of being a trader.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, specifically on the quant side, the best place to start is actually CS70 &#43; EE126 (from the interview I&#39;ve gotten). They like to ask a lot of probability questions, so make sure you get pretty good at the stuff. Other than basic probability stuff, focus especially on Markov chains and how to do expected values on them. I&#39;ve gotten several problems in interviews where the solution is to set up a Markov chain and perform calculations on them. Depending on the position and the firm, being able to answer them quickly might also be important (especially so for trading positions). Something I&#39;d recommend doing is taking an old 70 exam and trying them again. You should be able to solve every probability question without struggling too much.

I mainly reviewed core concepts (e.g. 126 and 189 core probability/optimization concepts). Note I had\u00a0spent some time learning some new statistic stuff (e.g. R-squared, etc) that I thought they would ask me about but that wasn&#39;t needed at all - the interviews were nice in the sense that they focussed on the areas\u00a0I had experience on rather than other topics.

TS&#39;s culture was very good. Work-life balance was very chill, I would play\u00a0chess (with interns and employees) during work hours, and there was an internal company-wide table-tennis competition. The people were all nice, helpful, and ridiculously smart.</p>\n<p>- From what I understand having interacted with\u00a0interns of other fintech companies there (e.g. Jane Street, quant interns in JP Morgan), the culture differs greatly per company. Jane Street interns seemed to have a fun time but there seemed to be a big emphasis in market making / betting (or at least their interns &#34;made markets&#34; all the time). JP Morgan interns had to dress up in suits and\u00a0seemed astonished when I told them how we played chess during work hours. So I&#39;d suggest researching / asking employees about their company culture before branding all of them as having the same culture.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid": "is6p8c8z13p7cd", "updated": "2019-03-22T23:12:20Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-03-20T16:20:08Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["enrichment_opportunities"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>How to get into Two Sigma/Jane Street/FinTech (both intern and full-time new grad)?
