We see relatively few who apply and don&#39;t make it, because people self-select at the time that they apply. I suspect that many who would not make the 3.3 GPA or nearly make it simply don&#39;t apply, so then it&#39;s hard to distinguish them from those who planned to be some other sort of major all along (though we could guess). I know that John DeNero does surveys in 61A about who intends to major in 61A. I know that even in the students who apply there are those who are denied for missing the GPA cutoff. You can appeal, though.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2021-05-05T18:49:25Z", "subject": "", "uid": "h87kastcacfxt"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "kobtedjom053s6", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1535223700, "hyq0br1u3kx7dg": 1525795138, "j5zp8esecm31rr": 1, "j7s01y165odq5": 1515461097, "j9j0udrxjjp758": 1519242790, "jjd5ukm1ddp6x6": 1535223700, "jkopvsyuy7g3u0": 1535681645}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j1hge0e6rt9yo", "name": "Alex Kassil", "photo": "1525041329_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j1hge0e6rt9yo/1525041329_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jjs6gy16me11et", "name": "Amy Li", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["j1hge0e6rt9yo", "jjs6gy16me11et"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {"editor": "rte", "has_emails_sent": 1, "seen": {"1053": 5, "10629": 7, "11615": 4, "12513": 6, "13623": 8, "2727": 3, "301": 0, "6614": 1, "6622": 2}}, "created": "2021-05-05T09:55:06Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "lscs", "policy", "eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would like to get some advice on CS major declaration.
