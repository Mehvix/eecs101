Let me clarify, we reserve seats for all incoming LSCS students that we know are intended CS and we prioritize them off of the waitlist. We also change the number of seats in reserve categories depending on the demand so in reality more seats in these classes go to LSCS students. Since we still have students who don&#39;t have to take 16B (those who were admitted before F17), we have to be more specific when it comes to the reserve categories for LSCS because not all LSCS students take the class during their\u00a01-2 years even though it is a lower-division class.\u00a0 The goal is to have a larger, less restrictive category in the coming years for LSCS students but at this\u00a0point we still need to make sure that all students of different years are able to enroll and graduate on time. Hope this helps answer the original question. If you have questions or concerns on this, I&#39;d be happy\u00a0to hear more about it offline.

For EECS16A and EECS16B, you may be enrolled in one discussion section, but attend a different one. When adding this class you should choose the lecture, a lab section, and DIS 999. The schedules of DIS sections are visible on <a href=\"http://classes.berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">classes.berkeley.edu</a>. You may attend any DIS section as long as there is a seat in the classroom. If the class is full, you will need to attend a different section. You must attend the lab section in which you are enrolled.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Switching Secondary Sections while Waitlisted</strong><strong>:</strong>\u00a0If you need to switch to another lab and/or dis section while waitlisted for an EE/EECS class, you still need to drop the class completely and re-add in order to switch.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are enrolled in a class, you should use the \u201cEdit\u201d feature in CalCentral to switch.

Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal. If you see yourself, however, suddenly shift down many seats at once, this could be a bug.

For EECS16A and EECS16B, you may be enrolled in one discussion section, but attend a different one. When adding this class you should choose the lecture, a lab section, and DIS 999.

For EECS16A and EECS16B, you may be enrolled in one discussion section, but attend a different one. When adding this class you should choose the lecture, a lab section, and DIS 999. The schedules of DIS sections are visible on <a href=\"http://classes.berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">classes.berkeley.edu</a>. You may attend any DIS section as long as there is a seat in the classroom. If the class is full, you will need to attend a different section.

Why did this happen?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0This is most likely due to an enrolled student switching from an open lab/discussion to a lab/discussion that is full. Since you cannot enroll into a full section, the enrolled student is bumped down to the waitlist at position #1, which shifts everyone down one. This is normal. If you see yourself, however, suddenly shift down many seats at once, this could be a bug.
