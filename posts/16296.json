However, there are so many great upper div EE and CS classes that taking one of those technicals would give you far more benefit than retaking 61B.

If you are really concerned about your software engineering skills because you didn&#39;t subject yourselves to gitlet,, simply take CS 169, as it will give you much more design principles than 61B ever will. Even if you really can&#39;t find a good CS UD to take, take something from another department.
