Content-wise I think you&#39;ll be more than comfortable with the material, but you may face some difficulty when it comes to the structure of the course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>16B is structured very similarly to 16A when it comes to course policies, homeworks, lectures, 2 discussions a week, and lab, so the first couple weeks may feel a bit overwhelming. For the circuits module, if you haven&#39;t taken an E&amp;M physics class before, I would focus specifically on the following topics going into 16B: Nodal Analysis (KCL, Ohms Law), Voltage Dividers, and Op-Amps. Also when it comes to lab, I took 16B 3 semesters after taking 16A, so I forgot everything when it came to wiring circuits, but the lab TAs are friendly and helpful enough to reteach you how to handle the breadboard, that I was able to pick it up by around the third week. Don&#39;t worry about the kits too much, a lot of students haven&#39;t taken 16A, and or took it too long ago and lost theirs so they will give you a new kit the first day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask or email me.</p>", "created": "2019-12-06T20:31:31Z", "subject": "", "uid": "isavdtjxldo7pe"}], "history_size": 1, "id": "k3ulu413tov779", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {"kk7tw2pmhvv6mn": 1620960163}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jcje0uwgrwb6n9", "name": "Aram Moghaddassi", "photo": "1583717939_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/jcje0uwgrwb6n9/1583717939_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1569903596, "jzdc840hwmd7dc": 1569898318}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "isavdtjxldo7pe", "name": "Taejin Hwang", "photo": "1507076312_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/isavdtjxldo7pe/1507076312_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["jcje0uwgrwb6n9", "isavdtjxldo7pe"], "type": "s_answer"}], "config": {"seen": {"10031": 7, "10159": 2, "10255": 6, "10303": 2, "10369": 1, "10646": 8, "10706": 5, "10870": 6, "1440": 4, "2365": 7, "2522": 0, "2545": 3, "2613": 1, "3184": 1, "3231": 9, "3372": 2, "3553": 4, "3702": 2, "3845": 9, "4245": 2, "4459": 1, "4583": 3, "4644": 4, "4891": 0, "5133": 4, "5293": 8, "5806": 0, "5827": 8, "584": 6, "5908": 3, "6253": 6, "6311": 2, "6476": 4, "6668": 2, "6861": 2, "7333": 8, "7593": 6, "8893": 3, "9024": 7, "9355": 1, "9767": 4, "9856": 1}}, "created": "2019-12-04T21:23:09Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["eecs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Hey all, as the title says, I&#39;m taking 16b next semester without 16a.

I&#39;m planning on working through the circuits module of 16a on my own (homeworks and such), but should I also invest in a circuits kit to practice on? I heard the 16a kit carries over to 16b; how would I get my own kit before the class?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Honestly, any advice at all would be appreciated.
