They have more than one academic interest. When I was in college, I briefly thought about double-majoring in my two favorite subjects, math and history. (Instead, I spent much of my time at the college newspaper and barely completed one major \u2014 applied math.)</td></tr><tr><td>But the reality is that many students who\u00a0double-major\u00a0aren\u2019t doing it out of intellectual curiosity. The number of double majors\u00a0<a href=\"http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=pMJKdIFVI6rhnDOuSyUF94Oa&#43;/iGFHvXcQ8s/xPfOLgLvFysUWfqST75eaEJe2RzRMUMG4OpbRG9ahekP/IYAWn3TMsrz1XnwGV36xBMWZX9XXZlb3fwJA==&amp;campaign_id=39&amp;instance_id=4948&amp;segment_id=6943&amp;user_id=37634c30ea47ed26d106c70e77641d08&amp;regi_id=87409839\" target=\"_blank\">has soared in recent years</a>\u00a0mostly because students see it as a way to add one more credential to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. What\u2019s even better than one major? Two majors!</td></tr><tr><td>Except that it\u2019s not. Most students would learn more by creatively mastering a single major \u2014 and leaving themselves time to take classes in multiple other fields. \u201cDouble majoring,\u201d as\u00a0<a href=\"http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=pMJKdIFVI6rIPFolOgq9ohKKE/b2YIp8bxkwZa5ISYvcuROmje39uJfKFN6FDhpZuE8rjXVdYFZwFVKmpoPjfL3Z0Gpq8M2hxjLN0yA7cPU=&amp;campaign_id=39&amp;instance_id=4948&amp;segment_id=6943&amp;user_id=37634c30ea47ed26d106c70e77641d08&amp;regi_id=87409839\" target=\"_blank\">Jacqueline Sanchez</a>, a Wellesley College student, wrote in a recent op-ed for her campus paper, \u201cultimately prevents students from exploring many different disciplines.\u201d</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately, double majoring is just one part of a credentials arms race among teenagers and college students. This arms race exacerbates inequality, because it can make upper-middle-class students seem more accomplished than working-class and poor students. And the arms race is also unpleasant and counterproductive for many of the well-off students. They\u2019re loading up on extracurricular activities, Advanced Placement courses and college majors, rather than exploring, going deep into one or two areas and learning what they really enjoy.</td></tr><tr><td>Yesterday afternoon in Dallas, David Coleman \u2014 the president of the College Board, which administers the SAT, A.P.\u2019s and other tests \u2014 gave a speech in which he took on the credentials arms race. I want to turn the rest of today\u2019s newsletter over to an\u00a0excerpt from that speech:</td></tr><tr><td>\u201cWe should also reframe extracurricular activities. Applications for college have as many as 10 spaces for students to fill out with activities outside of class. How about three? Let\u2019s say to students: \u2018Share 1 to 3 things you are devoted to outside your classwork. If you want to do more than three things outside of class, that\u2019s great, but not to get into college.\u2019</td></tr><tr><td>\u201cThe College Board needs to say a similar thing about taking\u00a0A.P. courses. We have data that taking up to five A.P. courses over the course of high school helps students complete college on time. But there is no evidence that excessively cramming your schedule with A.P. classes advances you. Let us say to students, \u2018If you would like to take more than 5 A.P. courses because you love the class, do so, but not to get into college.\u2019</td></tr><tr><td>\u201cWe all need to be careful when we say to students take as many rigorous courses as possible. May I say instead, please don\u2019t. Take the time to focus and do a few things well \u2014 and enjoy the golden time of high school.</td></tr><tr><td>\u201cIt is better for all students to make the path to college simpler and shorter. When applying to college becomes an endless list, it hurts low income students most.\u201d</td></tr><tr><td><strong>The full Opinion report</strong>\u00a0from The Times\u00a0follows, including\u00a0<a href=\"http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=pMJKdIFVI6pghfX2HXfSzxRpdoyDWYNWv/nD1XJkN0KZaaskRtv1zdVRdciJyWohlGNSLLnDAQBfTdJKjbrenmJx3viJL4373MMUiNz3S4Ec/zZln0JgnEZXKmiQ5jYG8ZpW9ueETjLV9AUsR7QHBQ==&amp;campaign_id=39&amp;instance_id=4948&amp;segment_id=6943&amp;user_id=37634c30ea47ed26d106c70e77641d08&amp;regi_id=8740983920181024\" target=\"_blank\">George Yancy</a>\u2019s bracing admission of America\u2019s culture-wide sexism.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>", "created": "2018-10-24T23:30:16Z", "subject": "Opinion: Do not double-major", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8"}], "history_size": 1, "i_edits": [], "id": "jnnskg08cvq6m6", "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "my_favorite": false, "no_answer_followup": 0, "nr": 8073, "num_favorites": 2, "q_edits": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "s_edits": [], "status": "active", "t": 1654548211478, "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j72dhuzho1f63u", "name": "Andrew Jalbert", "photo": "1518913216_35.png", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/j72dhuzho1f63u/1518913216_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"irwl7o7shzu70z": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ip7tr8jvrq678u", "name": "William Yang", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1568151855, "irdpgxf12pr3t1": 1, "jkj72dhu5xf7my": 1541360409, "jyz1vzhx2on2wq": 1568088917, "jzapntwvv074c9": 1569885082, "jzllv02dp7j3jh": 1568151855, "kb74zdsef1y42h": 1597086076}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "iq1ocowl1xq6ia", "name": "Kerry Yu", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"kaww3dlpw6n2fg": 1597045529}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpumlqaf2qb", "name": "Esther Cai", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["j72dhuzho1f63u", "ip7tr8jvrq678u", "iq1ocowl1xq6ia", "jzlnpumlqaf2qb"], "tags": ["instructor-note", "other"], "type": "note", "unique_views": 650}
