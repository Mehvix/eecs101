At the moment, the only classes I&#39;ve taken that have meaningful projects (imo) are cs61a/cs61b.

I probably won&#39;t be able to take most (project-oriented and not so mathematical or theoretical) cs upper divs  until next spring. Should I focus on personal projects or taking upper divs first before applying to internsbips?\n\nAnother thing--does leetcode help for non-software engineering positions as well? I&#39;m considering swe, but also ML or data. Are there good prep methods for those? Also, I think the upper divs you mentioned are geared towards swe more than other things(?).

You dont need CS upper divs or anything, the BYOW/gitlet projects are more than enough for you to show your skills. The irony of the CS interviews is that whatever youre being assessed on is 100% the opposite of what youll be doing on the job (which is kinda why I also hate it). You might not get a big tech company from unless you network, but even a small start up is equally, if not, more beneficial for you to learn on the job. Small startups let you work on full scale projects and directly involving you in the codebase/whatever they need to get done whilst big tech companies usually have internship projects lined up for you from the start.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yeah leetcode also helps for non-swe position I think -- its just a way to practice problem solving with code thats all. Some people need it more than others and thats okay. Other upper divs related to ML/data that is most relevant is 186/ds100. I honestly dont think hard core math (127/189/126) is ever useful on an real ML job at all apart from just you being familiar with the concepts.

Knowing what you enjoy is arguably more important than taking class X.

Technical interviews can be helped via leetcode as you said. Grinding it out definitely helps. For the behavioral side, you really just need to be honest and answer their questions to the best of your ability. They look for how well you can communicate your ideas and your values as a person. For example, a very common behavioral question is &#34;describe a time you had to work together as a team in a class, what worked/what didnt work and how did you overcome the challenges&#34;. Other questions can include like &#34;tell me a time where you got stuck at a bug for a very long time, what did you do?&#34;. These are very easy questions if you can simply draw from your experiences and use them as your answers while highlighting who you are as a character/team member. They can prove challenging/detrimental if you answer something like &#34;I never have any codes in my bug&#34; or &#34;I didn&#39;t really contribute to my team&#34;.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. As an international myself, the only &#34;extra things&#34; I did was apply/network more than most other people. In my sophomore year, I applied to about ~300 companies while getting a total of 3 interviews. There are many reasons why this is the case as most medium/smaller companies won&#39;t be able to (or they are just really lazy) sponsor your visa for you to work for an internship here, hence why a lot of companies simply reject international students from the get go as they can find someone equally as qualified who is from the States. To REALLY boost your chances, <strong>you need to network.</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This means going to tech talks by different companies and after the talk, go up to the engineers and have a chat with them, ask them questions about the job, role, and whether there are internship opportunities. If the conversation goes well, you can usually ask them for their contact information. It is on YOU to email them afterwards (even if they said they will contact you) asking them about the job opportunity and what you need to do to move forward. Another way you can network is finding seniors/graduates friends who can give you a referral to the company they are working in. Both these ways bypass the resume screening and rejection and at least give you a chance to get an interview, which honestly is harder than doing well in a technical interview if you are really prepared. I only applied to ~10 companies as a junior this year directly and used 5-6 referrals through friends and got a very good internship this summer. Networking is equally important, if not, more important than leetcoding your way to the top as an international student. You can&#39;t show your skills if they dont give you the opportunity to do so.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. It doesnt hurt to have personal projects, but its not required. It just provides you another talking point to demonstrate your interest in X and show that you have devoted time/commitment into finishing a long project which could reflect how you&#39;d do at the internship. Personally, I only included big upper division projects I did at Cal without any personal ones and it was fine. They care more about what you did in the project and whether you can explain what you did.\u00a0 I don&#39;t think coursera certificates help at all and projects definitely are more valuable. Don&#39;t let your school work suffer because of personal projects though, most of Cal&#39;s projects are more than enough to let you shine (162, 186, 161, etc.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is beneficial to gear your personal projects to 1 specific direction but really pick something you want to build -- that would lead to a higher rate of success and less chance of you feeling tedious doing something for the sake of doing it vs you doing something you enjoy doing.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke1bty1glom2h4", "name": "Amal Deepak Thiru", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c0yochtw6z6", "name": "Joshua Chandiramani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kcc3ysvjvev2lc", "name": "Vedha Santhosh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2bzxodnue661", "name": "Juhee Hong", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke1bty1glom2h4", "ke2c0yochtw6z6", "kcc3ysvjvev2lc", "ke2bzxodnue661"], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_2", "updated": "2021-06-24T07:33:22Z"}, {"anon": "no", "bucket_name": "Week 6/20 - 6/26", "bucket_order": 13, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-06-24T18:14:02Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kqb85gy9ir2qq", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>The Leetcode 101 DeCal that was offered for the first time last sem aims to help students with these exact worries and prepare them for the recruitment process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more info!</p>", "tag_good": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ke2c0yochtw6z6", "name": "Joshua Chandiramani", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kcc3ysvjvev2lc", "name": "Vedha Santhosh", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"global": 1593320517, "kag9wdymr471kd": 1592281562, "kbesvacrkom2of": 1592997163, "kdyv6ps4qkq2in": 1604685455, "kjukuuch9zp6xi": 1612553217, "kjxe8woei5v5hr": 1611437455, "kjzc5mplx7k26m": 1614797185, "kpxbisi4v2s13x": 1627318462}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "kaddqruc8a45kz", "name": "Rahul Shah", "photo": "1622660778_200.jpg", "photo_url": "https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/kaddqruc8a45kz/1622660778_200.jpg", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6", "name": "Justin Xia", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["ke2c0yochtw6z6", "kcc3ysvjvev2lc", "kaddqruc8a45kz", "jzlnpfrl2qk2e6"], "type": "followup", "uid": "jzqdiqjopyq4p6", "updated": "2021-06-24T18:14:02Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 6/20 - 6/26", "bucket_order": 13, "children": [], "config": {"editor": "rte"}, "created": "2021-06-24T18:25:26Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "kqb8k46s47qm3", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I would like to add a bit of info for 2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Are you by chance a Canadian, Mexican, or Australian citizen?
