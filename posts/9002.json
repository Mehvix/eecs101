Since the topics are covered over the course of a entire semester, instead of the rushed 6 weeks of cs70, the content is much more digestible (also if you took Data100, they spend a super rushed lecture on probability topics like expectation, variance etc and don&#39;t do the topic justice so again the content will be more digestible than in that course).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, I am of the strong (and biased) opinion that nobody can teach probability better than Professor Adhikari, and I believe that if you didn&#39;t like probability in the past, she just might change your mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of your ability to survive, since you&#39;ve already taken 70, you have at least seen the topics before (even if you didn&#39;t fully understand them). Now, you can take the time to really understand the nuances of the topics you missed in 70. Since you are willing to put in the work, and have a strong desire to learn this material that you&#39;ve never had a chance to love, you can succeed. At some point in courses, its less about preparation and more about willpower in order to succeed (coming from someone who entered Stat140 with only Math 1b under my belt - I don&#39;t recommend that lol but its still possible to do well).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even if you don&#39;t plan to do ML/AI in the future, I still think based on your CS background you can get more out of 140 than 134. Its the modern age of computing, and Adhikari herself said that 134 is the probability she learned in college decades ago. When I took the course, I really appreciated how it tied more mathematical topics of probability to modern CS applications. In my semester, we had a lab that showed we can decrypt an encrypted piece of text with Markov chains!
