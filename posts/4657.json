The basic answer is the core fundamental upper-divs in this area are: EECS 126, 127, 189, and 188. 170 is essentially always useful for everyone wherever their interests end up in majors offered by the EECS department. Of these, 170, 126, and 127 can be taken immediately after the lower-division and you will get a lot out of them. You will get a lot more out of 188 and 189 if you take them after these three. (Your goal in research is not to become a good minion as fast as you can, it is to understand the fundamentals so you can absorb more during your inevitable minion-phase.) \u00a0106AB (robotics) is also pretty important. And 120 going to 128 can be helpful, particularly so on the research side. Math 110 is pretty vital if you really want to be on the research path here. Graduate courses: 229a, 223, 227B are good for theoretical strength and 280, 287, etc. for things connected to specific application domains. There are also a bunch of special topics graduate courses. But by the time you are thinking of taking any graduate course, there should be a graduate student mentor or professor advising you.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-08-01T06:13:30Z", "subject": "", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9"}], "id": "j5t6tobay7m4h5", "is_tag_endorse": false, "tag_endorse": [{"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "i54n7o5aqtj7ek", "name": "Justin Hwang", "photo": "1489907551_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/i54n7o5aqtj7ek/1489907551_35.png", "published": true, "role": "", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "name": "Logan Howard", "photo": "1471912865_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/hccnzx9ezt97j7/1471912865_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "idvyyvxjglc", "name": "Pedram Pourdavood", "photo": null, "photo_url": null, "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "j4199ilx2115mx", "name": "Parham", "photo": "1518019944_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/j4199ilx2115mx/1518019944_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {"ijkj0mez6r218b": 1, "j3b97758y6d1tj": 1}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "ijly8cfwGjP", "name": "Nader Namini", "photo": "1544211678_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/ijly8cfwGjP/1544211678_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}, {"admin": false, "endorser": {}, "facebook_id": null, "id": "is6p6uis14y5ot", "name": "Elena Jia", "photo": "1545635952_35.png", "photo_url": "https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/photos/is6p6uis14y5ot/1545635952_35.png", "published": true, "role": "student", "us": false}], "tag_endorse_arr": ["i54n7o5aqtj7ek", "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "idvyyvxjglc", "j4199ilx2115mx", "ijly8cfwGjP", "is6p6uis14y5ot"], "type": "i_answer"}], "config": {}, "created": "2017-08-01T05:44:51Z", "data": {"embed_links": []}, "default_anonymity": "no", "drafts": null, "folders": ["cs-intended", "lscs"], "history": [{"anon": "stud", "content": "<p>What is a typical class path to take for someone in LSCS who is interested in doing research in Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science?</p>\n<p>By the time I declare, I will have taken 61abc, ee16ab, cs c8, cs70, and maybe cs c100.
