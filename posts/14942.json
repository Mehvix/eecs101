And Wagner is also awesome and really caring for his students. When I took Data 8, it wasn&#39;t much workload and kind of like your standard introductory course. I doubt switching to Econ 1 would make a difference (never taken that class tho), unless you really don&#39;t care about data science or statistics.

I will say that I would classify a lot of it as brute work or busy work since you will spend a lot of time fighting C or assembly and whatnot to make your code work. Conceptually, the class is also the first foray into low-level software and hardware that most people have, so it can have a learning curve if you have no idea what is going on.\n\nCS 170 is a pset class. It has pretty lengthy psets each week, standard midterms, and both a project and a final.
