Sometimes schools will ask for a personal statement or some variant of it, which is to describe your background but often its to highlight any sort of disadvantages you might have faced while pursuing your studies. A few programs will ask for which professors you want to work with and why or select professors you are interested in working with (although this is less common for masters programs I think).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Check out: <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf\">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf</a> for more details about applying to PhD programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A note about applying to PhD and then mastering out: PhD programs at top universities are much harder to get into than their respective masters. Some schools will only let you apply to one, some will let you be considered for masters programs, and others will let you apply to multiple so be careful about this. If your intention is to get into a PhD program such that you don&#39;t need to pay for a masters I&#39;d reconsider, especially if you want to go to a good university.
