The 127 psets are due weekly this semester, and 189 is biweekly, but balancing both of those continuous psets takes up most of my time - I would not have enjoyed adding another tech class with weekly psets on top of that (I took Stat140 spring 2017 and spent about 10 hours on each homework). I do like the combo of 189 &#43; 127 - the material at least for the first third of the semester has nicely played off each other in terms of being like &#34;oh I proved this result in the other class last week and now its in this class this week&#34;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, it would be more beneficial to take Stat 140 BEFORE 189 (even if Shewchuk is teaching) - you want to become really comfortable with probability before you are required to use it in 189. To elaborate, HW2 with Shewchuk was a massive math review homework (took an incredibly long time to do) which had many probability problems that required you to be comfortable with expectation, variance, probability distributions etc, all of which are taught later in Stat140.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps swap 186 and 140?
