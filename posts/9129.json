Most, if not all, of us can&#39;t do everything. Assuming you&#39;re not a transfer, you have enough time to take a fair amount of EECS upper divs without having to take 3 per semester (I&#39;m personally not doing more than 2 per semester, until the semester right before I graduate probably). Chances are you might be including too many courses that you&#39;d like to take because you may have a passing interest in them, and if so, I suggest culling that list, so that it can align best with your goals. Do you have a certain sub-domain/ field of interest in mind? Are you trying to go to grad school? If so, leetcode isn&#39;t going to matter, research &#43; taking a bunch of courses pertinent to that field (and doing well in them) will. Are you heavily interested in industry? If so, focus on prioritizing the core SWE classes, recruiting apps, and on interview prep. Do you really need to take 189 and 127 and 126 all together in your sophomore fall/spring semester? Not unless you&#39;re prioritizing ML specifically, and again, possibly grad school for the same. Your goals will go a long way in determining how you manage your time the next couple years, and personally speaking, the quicker you can make a decision as to what your goal is going to be, the more time you have to hit it. And once you make up your mind, ignore the noise as to what everyone else may be taking and doing and stick to your goals.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m not a senior and hence I&#39;m not posting in the student response above, but these are my two cents.</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "followup", "uid_a": "a_1", "updated": "2019-04-13T22:31:50Z"}, {"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/14 - 4/20", "bucket_order": 49, "children": [{"anon": "stud", "bucket_name": "Week 4/14 - 4/20", "bucket_order": 49, "children": [], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-14T21:23:50Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "juhfsd0pf504kb", "subject": "<p>Thank you!!</p>", "tag_good": [], "tag_good_arr": [], "type": "feedback", "uid_a": "a_0", "updated": "2019-04-14T21:23:50Z"}], "config": {}, "created": "2019-04-14T06:39:21Z", "data": {"embed_links": null}, "folders": [], "id": "jugk6x4hjct3g", "no_answer": 0, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Agree with the follow-up above, make it a habit, just apply to at least 3 jobs a day and do 30 min. of prep.
